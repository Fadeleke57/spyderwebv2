The plague of the creative class, DWS involves the dwindling of the wrist muscles such that the afflicted can fit into those impossibly small cuff sizes on a dress shirt. (Victims are also known have impossibly smooth, uncalloused hands.) In all honesty, I’m not quite that bad off — I can open almost any jar without help — but I do still register (just barely) on the DWS spectrum. And when I saw that the Apple Watch came in two sizes, one with a 38-mm face and the other with a 42-mm face, I panicked and couldn’t help but wonder: Would I be less of a man if I bought a smaller Apple Watch? There have been many articles written about how to figure out which watch size is right for you (my favorite is this neat dollar bill-folding trick), but none help you deal with the side-eye you’ll get after buying the wrong one. So I texted my best friend, an investment banker who inherited a love of watches from his grandfather, a former watch repairman. Surely, he would surely set me straight. “Hold on. Eating a sandwich,” he replied. A few bites later, he explained that he works with people who wear $10,000 watches as a statement piece, so I should go big or go home. But one thing people don’t realize about the smaller-sized Apple Watch is that it’s already quite sizable. According to Matt Bain, Miami Beach, Fla.-based antique watch dealer, the standard size of a men’s watch today, on the smaller side, is approximately 36 mm. “Men are wearing watches all the way up to 48 mm, 48 being very large,” he says. “I think the perfect size watch for a man today is probably about a 40-mm watch.” Which, of course, is right in the middle of Apple’s sizing, and as such, is no help at all. In Bain’s expert opinion, the smaller Apple Watch should work perfectly fine for a man of my slenderness. In fact, when it comes to Apple’s watch, he seems to regard its face size like that of a touchscreen phone — it’s all about utility and being able to see and interact with the display. “I have the smaller iPhone … other people don’t even care. I think on the wrist, it’s the same thing,” he says. “Thirty-eight millimeters is still a large watch — it’s not a small watch, and I don’t consider it to be a woman’s one.” For its part, Apple claims their watches are unisex, but their bands certainly have target markets in mind. For example, the Leather Loop band, which looks rugged yet refined, will only fit the 42-mm Apple Watch. And the Modern Buckle, with its elegant, subtle styling, is only available on the 38-mm version. So, if, like me, you want a smaller watch face with the more burly leather strap, you’re out of luck, and likewise if you want a larger watch face with a demure leather band. Still torn, I decided to get a woman’s opinion. I’ve known Andrea Lavinthal, PEOPLE Magazine’s style and beauty director, since college. It turns out she’s a watch aficionado herself, owning a small collection of treasured timepieces. “When they say unisex for a watch, in my opinion, that means typically a woman can wear a men’s watch,” Lavinthal says. “But it almost never means a man can wear a woman’s watch.” Funny enough, Lavinthal does make an odd exception to this rule. In contrast to my best friend’s assertion that I should go big to show off, Lavinthal thinks I should brag by going small. According to her, guys tend to size up more than is necessary on everything from cars to clothes. “They size up in their clothing forever until they either meet a woman who gives them a makeover, or they find a really good sales person, tailor, or friend with better style who they randomly start trusting,” she says. “It almost takes an intervention to get a guy to wear the proper size clothing.” These man-childs apparently wear large and extra-large sized clothing, when they really should be sporting mediums. “Wearing the bigger size makes you look like a little person wearing a big t-shirt,” says Lavinthal. “The medium is going to fit you and actually make you look bigger.” And likewise, when it comes to this smart watch — which is still an awkward fashion piece, despite Apple’s design prowess — wearing the proper size is likely to make it less clunky. Heck, if you wear the right size, it might even look like a watch, and not a wrist-top computer. So I put the question to Lavinthal, point blank: If I bought a smaller Apple Watch, would she think I was less of a man? “No,” she responds. “I would say you’re cheaper.” And this is true: the smaller-sized Apple Sport Watch rings in at $50 less than the larger model. A watch that fits and almost enough extra cash to buy one of these lovely Nomad Apple Watch Stands? That is a stigma I can live with.

{"type": "article", "header": "Forget the iPhone X, Apple’s Best Product Is Something You Can’t Buy ", "author": "John Patrick Pullen", "update_date/publish_date": "November 1, 2017 1:09 PM [ET] | October 27, 2017 8:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4998189/iphone-x-privacy-apple/", "text": "There’s this photo of my kids in the bath that, well, I’d rather not tell you about. I mean, it’s incredibly cute and I’d love to show it to you, but I’m also a private person, so it wouldn’t be right to go into details. But I will say this: though it’s one of my favorite possessions, this picture doesn’t physically exist. It’s not in a frame, and I don’t even have a print of it. It’s just a series of ones and zeros sitting on a server, somewhere in the world. And when I get my new iPhone X, I’ll probably immediately pull it up to look at it on Apple’s gorgeous new fullscreen display and remark how fast the kids have grown. A cliché, I know, but that doesn’t make it any less true. I can’t help myself — that’s how adorable this photo is. As precious as this image is, I don’t have it stored on a flash drive attached to my keychain, or in some other ultra-safe place. Instead, it’s housed on a server in some unknown probably dank and sunless location. That’s no casual decision. I’ve put considerable time and thought into how I store my photos in general, as well as how I back up my information overall. Despite all the bottomless storage features offered by tech giants like Google and Amazon, I default to keeping my most valuable data with Apple. Why I chose this matters, so let’s talk about it. First and foremost, there’s the issue of these companies’ business models. The goal of each outfit is to make the most money it can for its shareholders, naturally, and in that sense Apple — pricing its products at a premium — is the most visible example of the maxim. But $1,000 iPhones and pricey accessories aside, at least the company is only buttering its bread on one side. Google, by contrast, not only sells phones and other devices, but also makes money off the ads (and the user data) that appear on those handsets, laptops and tablets. Amazon’s gadget-oriented business model wants to sell you things (like Amazon Echos) that will help sell you more things (through voice ordering) — a dizzying value proposition. And then there’s Facebook, which doesn’t appear to be selling its users much of anything at this point. But look more closely and you discover Facebook’s users (and their kids’ bath time photos) are themselves the products unwittingly feeding the social network’s revenue model. The second reason I trust my kids’ naked baby photos to Apple is the company’s longstanding commitment to privacy. Succinctly outlined on Apple’s new privacy website, the company’s stance on keeping a lid on data has been catalogued not only in its marketing materials, but in its posture toward groups looking to crack its products’ embedded security. Proactivity and transparency are undervalued but essential character traits of any company I care to do business with in 2017. (That’s something I’ve come to realize in the wake of the Equifax hack.) Remember 2016’s Apple versus the FBI dust-up, which nearly turned security protocols into a question of Constitutional rights? While you can argue over Apple’s pro-encryption stance from a law enforcement perspective, what’s inescapable is the company’s commitment to keeping its users’ data locked down. Critics of Apple at the Justice Department called its fight with the FBI a marketing ploy — a claim the iPhone maker disputes. Whether you believe the company or not, Apple has only made its security stronger since then. One way it’s done so is through a technology called differential privacy. The idea behind this complex consumer protection is that through the use of cloud computing, small gadgets like iPhones can tap remote computers to have capabilities that are much bigger than their portable sizes might otherwise allow. Consider a cloud computing paradox: to get the most out of the cloud, remote servers require data — the more granular the information, the better. But data, if it’s somehow viewed or intercepted, can unmask the sender. By using differential privacy, Apple injects “noise” into its bits and bytes, rendering this information useless to third parties who might otherwise be able to view it. Wired recently explored research by a team of experts that had deconstructed Apple’s code and found its differential privacy practices to be lacking, a characterization that the company strongly disputes. But even these experts call Apple’s implementation a “good first step.” It also bodes well that the company is deploying this technology for personal data as important as my health tracking metrics and as trivial as my emoji preferences—something I doubt its competition is doing, though Google uses differential privacy in its Chrome browser, Wired points out. Still, I’d rather have a well-intentioned system that’s not yet perfect for my family photos’ sake, than one designed to monetize my data from the outset. Of course photo security is a sensitive subject for Apple. One of the company’s biggest black eyes came in 2014, when hundreds of celebrities’ accounts were hacked and their private photos were scattered across the Internet. While most certainly bad news for Apple, the method that experts believe the hackers used to crack the company’s iCloud service was simple phishing emails, which were designed to trick recipients into disclosing the passwords of their accounts. Obviously the phishing expedition worked (though only to a point, because the perpetrators are still being caught and charged, as recently as this week), and Apple’s system shares blame for being so easily exploitable. But the company reacted by making much-needed changes to its security, including the implementation of two-factor authentication, which greatly reduces the likelihood that a fraudster will take over your account. I realize locks only keep honest people out, and as long as tech companies pursue better security solutions, hackers will try to break them. Still, Apple’s singleminded focus on locking down its systems justifies the premiums it charges for its products, to me at least. Not that I’d pay any price, of course. As the iPhone X’s sticker price soared over $1,000, even I paused. But then I thought of all the systems working to make this device digitally impenetrable, security apparatuses that weren’t needed when the world-changing smartphone first arrived 10 years ago. All of these things are working in concert to make the iPhone X the most secure Apple product yet. And I can’t wait to stretch that photo of my kids across its glorious new screen. It’ll be really something — and I’m glad you won’t be able to see it. John Patrick Pullen has written about smart devices and home automation for TIME and Fortune since 2009.

{"type": "article", "header": "What to Know About the U.S. Apple Antitrust Lawsuit", "author": "Solcyré Burga", "update_date/publish_date": "March 21, 2024 2:48 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6959254/doj-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-monopoly-iphone/", "text": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Apple on Thursday, accusing the tech giant of maintaining a monopoly over the smartphone market.  The complaint, which was filed with 16 state and district attorneys general, argues that Apple engages in anticompetitive behavior by restricting how third-party products can interact with its products, including apps, non-Apple smartwatches, and more.  “For years, Apple responded to competitive threats by imposing a series of ‘Whac-A-Mole’ contractual rules and restrictions that have allowed Apple to extract higher prices from consumers, impose higher fees on developers and creators, and to throttle competitive alternatives from rival technologies,” said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. Attorney General Merrick Garland claimed in a press conference that Apple’s dominance comes \"not by making its own products better—but by making other products worse.\" Apple argues the latest lawsuit would lead to government overreach that would restrict the company’s ability to freely design its technology. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,” said Apple in a statement. “If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect.” Apple’s shares fell more than 4% during trading on Thursday as of 2 p.m. ET.  Here’s what to know about the lawsuit.  The antitrust lawsuit alleges that Apple has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which says that anyone who monopolizes, or tries to monopolize a part of the trade or commerce industry will be guilty of a felony.  The Justice Department alleges that Apple has monopoly power over the smartphone market because it favors Apple products—think: Apple Watch or Apple Wallet—over those of third-parties. “This is about opening the smartphone market and making sure that the emerging technologies of the future, the innovation, the creativity that American consumers want is ultimately available because of cases about the future,” a DOJ official said during a Thursday press call.  The complaint claims Apple has suppressed mobile cloud streaming services, blocked apps that would make it easier for users to switch between smartphone platforms, and made cross-platform messaging worse. For instance, an app called Beeper Mini that allowed Android users to use iMessage and send texts with blue bubbles, was shut down by Apple in December 2023. Apple’s conduct, the Department alleges, affects web browsers, news subscriptions,  location services, and more. Apple argues that the lawsuit would set a “dangerous precedent” and would allow the government to “take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”  “We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,” the company added.  It is not clear what relief the DOJ is seeking under this suit or how the outcome could affect consumers. If the court rules in the DOJ’s favor, it's possible Apple could be forced to break up. A DOJ official said the consequences would have to be determined after a trial. “Equitable relief is on the table for Sherman Act Section Two violations and the range of possible remedies are supposed to not only redress violations but prevent their recurrence and fully restore competition that's been lacking in the market,” the official said.  Thursday's lawsuit is the third filed against the company by the DOJ since 2010. The department reached a settlement with Apple and five other tech companies in 2010 after they faced allegations of colluding to suppress workers’ salaries. In 2016, the company was forced to pay $450 million to settle allegations that it conspired with publishers to increase e-book prices.  In 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular video game Fortnite, sued Apple, arguing that requiring customers to get apps through the app store and pay for digital content inside an app using Apple’s system was a monopolistic practice. A judge in 2021 required Apple to let developers give consumers other payment options, but didn't find that the company had an illegal monopoly in the issue at hand. Across the pond, the European Union confirmed that it is investigating Apple’s decision to shut down Epic Games’ developer accounts, according to TechCrunch. Apple is the last major tech giant to face a major federal antitrust case, as regulators continue to apply greater scrutiny to Big Tech practices with complaints filed against Google and Meta.  Apple has long defended its practices. In response to an E.U. antitrust complaint from Spotify in 2019, Apple said that its aim has always been to “grow the pie” and “create more opportunities not just for our business, but for artists, creators, entrepreneurs and every ‘crazy one’ with a big idea.” After a 2020 House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee report on Big Tech claimed that Apple has “monopoly power” over software distribution on iPhones, the company pushed back: “We have always said that scrutiny is reasonable and appropriate but we vehemently disagree with the conclusions reached in this staff report with respect to Apple,” Apple said in a statement at the time. “Our company does not have a dominant market share in any category where we do business.” Write to Simmone Shah at simmone.shah@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/6318369/apple-iphone-factory-india/", "https://time.com/6656392/facebook-20th-anniversary-mark-zuckerberg-meta-legacy/"], "sentiment_score": 0.03810763888888889, "subjectivity_score": 0.4928385416666666},
{"type": "article", "header": "How Apple’s iPhone Changed These 5 Major Industries", "author": "Tim Bajarin", "update_date/publish_date": "June 26, 2017 12:56 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4832599/iphone-anniversary-industry-change/", "text": "On June 29, Apple celebrates the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, a device all but culturally synonymous with the word smartphone. I was lucky enough to preview one the day before Steve Jobs introduced it at MacWorld in January 2007. Apple senior vice-president of marketing Phil Schiller laid a silver-framed black rectangle on a coffee table, then asked me what I saw. I told him I saw a piece of glass in a metal case. He told me that’s what Apple wants you to see — in “off” mode, that’s exactly what it is. But turn it on and the magic happens. Apple sees itself as a software company first, and devices like its MacBooks, iPods, iPhones, the Apple TV and Apple Watch as vehicles for those core operating concepts. Before its release, the hype for an Apple-devised phone was off the scale. It even garnered the nickname the “Jesus phone” — or better still, “jPhone” — as some felt it would be miraculous. At the time, none of us believed it could live up to the hype. To our surprise, the iPhone turned out to be a game-changer, a powerful new technology that went on to impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world, changing the way they communicated, worked, learned and played. But the most surprising thing about the iPhone is the impact it’s had on five major industries. The first industry it upended was the PC market, where Apple’s stroke of genius was to put one in your pocket. Until the iPhone shipped, PC sales were around 400 million a year. But as the iPhone and smartphones in general have become critical tools for information, used for productivity, communications and pleasure, the PC has become less important to many people. Until the mobile revolution that came with the iPhone, the only way people could access the Internet was from a PC or laptop. Today, thanks to the iPhone, iPad and all the Android equivalents inspired by Apple’s ideas, people have many more options to make the connections they need regardless of location. Consequently, the PC industry is now shipping only about 275 to 290 million PCs a year, and this has caused a level of industry consolidation that is now concentrated around Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer and Apple. The second industry the iPhone impacted was Telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon. Before the iPhone, most of the original telco business models were around voice. Yes, Voice over IP became popular by 2000 and had already started pushing the telecom companies to move to digital voice instead of traditional landline voice delivery methods. But with the advent of the iPhone, they were effectively forced out of the traditional voice business altogether. Try and find a payphone today, in contrast with the millions of payphones that were in place a decade ago. Today’s telecom providers are data communications companies whose business models have been completely transformed. All have added things like information and entertainment services, and all have become conduits for multiple types of data services to their customers. The third industry the iPhone turned on its head was the movie and TV business. For most of my life in order to watch a movie I had to go to a movie theater, and to watch a TV show I had to sit in front of my television at home. The iPhone created a mobile platform for video delivery, and since 2007 every major movie and TV studio has been forced to expand their distribution methods to include downloaded and streaming services to mobile devices. We can thank the millions of iPhones in the field, capable of letting people watch video anytime and anywhere, for prodding these studios to make this so. We can also thank the iPhone for fueling new types of video services like Youtube, Netflix and Hulu — video powerhouses, at least 50% of whose content is viewed on some type of mobile device. The fourth industry the iPhone impacted has been the gaming industry. Before 2007, most games were either delivered by way of game consoles, a PC or a dedicated handheld device like the Nintendo DS or Sony PlayStation Portable. The iPhone expanded the market for mobile games as well as created an entirely new category of touch-based gameplay, persuading even holdouts like Nintendo to come aboard with games based on its iconic franchises. And though the mobile dominant free-to-play model fractionalizes revenue, the potential for brand exposure is unprecedented: Niantic’s augmented reality-angled Pokémon Go alone has been downloaded over 750 million times. Contrast with Nintendo’s entire Mario franchise’s lifetime sales of just over 500 million. The iPhone has also impacted the health industry. Today, one can use an iPhone to monitor various health metrics as well as access detailed health information, connecting with health professionals and even receiving health advice virtually anytime and anywhere. And we’ve only begun to see how smartphones can impact the health industry, an impact that will doubtless expand as this industry embraces the smartphone for outpatient care. But the iPhone’s most transformative influence has been on Apple itself. Before the iPhone, Apple was known as Apple Computer. Today it is Apple Inc., a company that makes much more than computers. And the iPhone today accounts for over 60% of Apple’s total revenue, bringing in record profits each year. It’s one of the bestselling products in history, with about 1.3 billion units in global sales, generating more than $800 billion in revenue. Apple is already the most valuable company on the planet by market capitalization, and on track to become the world’s first trillion dollar one. Looking back over the last 10 years, the hype before the launch of the iPhone if anything underestimated its impact on global industries and individuals. And with Apple on track to define and grow emerging technologies like augmented reality in mobile, Cupertino seems poised to make the iPhone even more important to our digital lifestyles, transforming industries in ways we have yet to imagine.

{"type": "article", "header": "Never Offline", "author": "Lev Grossman", "update_date/publish_date": "September 11, 2014 6:11 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/3326576/never-offline/", "text": "Apple isn’t in the business of inventing things, or at least not primarily. It practices a grislier trade: resurrection. The company’s modus operandi is to browse for dead product categories, looking for freshly dug graves that might contain carrion ripe for reanimation–digital music players, tablet computers. Sometimes it comes across the walking dead, like the smartphone business, which had died though nobody noticed. When it finds a likely candidate, Apple dissects it and studies the various causes of death. Then it builds something so completely thought through, so seductively designed, so snugly embedded in webs of content and services and communications, that it not only lives again, it thrives to the point of annihilating memories of anything that came before. Apple creates demand for things that there previously was no demand for. It takes products we never wanted and convinces us we can’t live without them. It does this better than any company in the world. This time Apple has dug up a truly grim specimen, the smart watch. Lots of bodies buried here, whole cemeteries’ worth. This operation is vintage Apple, the classic Lazarus maneuver. It’s the first time the company has attempted it since the death of its legendary co-founder and presiding genius, Steve Jobs, but happily the product it has created is convincingly Jobsian: a startlingly beautiful and full-featured device called the Apple Watch. Note the absent i. It has to be good, because Apple isn’t just reviving an old category, it’s moving a boundary. It’s attempting to put technology somewhere where it’s never been particularly welcome before: on our bodies. When CEO Tim Cook and his colleagues talk about the Apple Watch the words they use over and over again are “personal” and “intimate,” and it’s true in the most literal way possible: they’re asking you to let them strap a computer to your arm. Like a pushy date, the Apple Watch wants to get intimate with us in a way we’re not entirely used to and may not be prepared for. This isn’t just a new product; this is technology attempting to colonize our bodies. Technological progress tends to feel incremental, but this is a watershed, a frog-boiling moment. There was a time when the Internet was something you dialed up; then it was replaced in the late 1990s by broadband, the always-on Internet, a formula that already sounds quaint. Apple Watch signals the advent of an always-there Internet, an Internet that can’t be put away. We’re used to dabbling just our fingertips in the Internet, but the Apple Watch doesn’t stop there. It tracks your movements. It listens to your heartbeat. It puts your whole body online. Exactly how personal do we want to get? If the Apple watch succeeds, it will do so on the back of many, many failures. Wristwatches first became popular in the 1920s, after soldiers came back from World War I wearing military-issue “trench watches,” but since then we’ve mostly discouraged them from evolving. They tell the time and not much more–we like our watches dumb. The first calculator watch appeared in the mid-1970s, and it was a novelty, but that was all. In subsequent decades it was followed by pager-watches and phone-watches, which people wanted even less. In 2004 Microsoft produced the SPOT watch, a $300 device that conveyed instant messages, stock updates, weather forecasts broadcast over spotty FM radio signals. It died unnoticed a few years later. The only survivor from this cheerless era is, in fact, the original calculator watch, which currently retails for about $25 at Target. But the dream didn’t die. Technology companies have simply refused to give up on the idea that we want computers on our wrists–they insist on it. Over the past few years nearly every one of Apple’s rivals has put out a smart watch, probably motivated at least in part by the iPhone maker’s poorly concealed interest in them. Samsung, Sony, LG and Motorola all sell them. According to Strategy Analytics, Samsung has shipped more than a million watches in its Galaxy Gear line, though reviews have been mixed, and they show no signs of cracking into the mainstream. In June Google released Android Wear, a version of its mobile operating system tuned specifically for watches. A smart watch called the Pebble started in 2012 as a Kickstarter project and has sold about 400,000 units. “We’re in extremely early days,” says Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky. “It’s still kind of like the 2008 era for smartphones, when the iPhone had just come out.” Smart watches are themselves only one sector of a larger, equally unsuccessful, equally tenacious technology category called wearables. Google Glass is probably the most ambitious example, but wearables also include fitness trackers like Fitbit, Jawbone’s Up and Nike’s Fuelband. Doctors like them–hospital systems like the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic have been trying to incorporate Fitbits into their health care regimens, with some success. Analysts tend to treat the wearables category as a mighty, slumbering giant that could awaken at any moment–Credit Suisse, for example, predicts that in three to five years people will be spending $30 billion to $50 billion annually on wearables. But in 2013 the entire fitness wearables market still amounted to only $330 million, a rounding error for Apple, which takes in $171 billion in revenue annually. The nonadoption of wearables to date can largely be attributed to a single factor: people don’t want to wear them. The problem is partly aesthetic–wearables tend to be ugly–but it’s more personal than that. You can use a device and still distance yourself from it by tucking it out of sight. But wearing a device says something about who you are, and it’s not always necessarily something you want to say. A special term of endearment has been coined just for people who wear Google Glass: glassholes. The rapturous reception of the Apple Watch thus far suggests that it will be the first wearable to overcome the resistance that has so far dogged the category. Aesthetics aren’t a problem: it’s pretty. In person it’s small and surprisingly light, especially compared with other smart watches out there. Its sapphire touchscreen is slightly curved, which makes it look like a piece of jewelry rather than a gadget, though it also attracts fingerprints and smudges. It sits on the wrist naturally. It doesn’t feel overly showy or intrusive, constantly begging for your attention, the way other wearables do. You could easily forget you’re wearing it. The other significant design challenge Apple faced was the interface: a watch is too small for the kind of prodding and pinching we’re used to doing on phones and tablets, and when you swipe across it, your fingertip obscures most of the screen. So the interface relies on Siri, Apple’s voice-activated digital-assistant software, but it also includes some genuine innovations. The screen can understand the difference between a tap and a more forceful press, and the watch gives feedback with audio and haptic (meaning slight vibrations) cues as well as visual ones. A small sensor-filled nub on the side of the watch, which Apple has dubbed the “digital crown,” enables you to zoom in and out, scroll through lists and navigate home. The watch’s elegance belies a surprisingly rich feature set. It makes calls like a phone. It handles text messages and emails, though because of the tiny screen reading is a lot easier than writing. Users can send one another small drawings that animate and then disintegrate after a few seconds. They can also, uselessly but nevertheless beguilingly, send their heartbeat to each other. Double tapping on the screen sends a gentle nudge to a nearby friend, like a light tap on the wrist. In practice it’s silly, ephemeral and lovely. The Apple Watch–the cheapest model will sell for $349–already supports dozens of apps, often scaled-down but still impressive versions of familiar iPhone and iPad apps: weather, stocks, passbook, photos, maps, calendar. (Much of this functionality relies on a link to a nearby iPhone for GPS and Internet connectivity.) It can control your iPhone’s music and camera and, through Apple’s HomeKit software, your thermostat, your door locks, your television and your lights. Crucially, it supports Apple’s new wireless payment system, which is designed to replace credit-card swipes and which is a major play in its own right. Apple has also doubled down on health and fitness features, which makes sense since that’s the one area where wearables have gotten traction. The Apple Watch tracks how many steps you take and whether you’re exercising enough or sitting down too long. A set of four optical sensors on the underside can take readings of your heart rate. Most smart watches available now provide some of these functions, though poorly. Apple promises the watch will not only work but learn about your habits over time to become a better coach. One could easily imagine the device providing a useful daily activity profile to your doctor. It’s intoxicating and also a bit disconcerting to have this much functionality perching on your wrist, like one of Cinderella’s helpful bluebirds. Wearables get inside your personal bubble. We’re used to technology being safely Other, but the Apple Watch wants to snuggle up and become part of your Self. This is technology, after being repeatedly repulsed, finally establishing a new beachhead. To wear a device as powerful as the Apple Watch makes you ever so slightly posthuman. This is new and slightly unnerving. When technologies get adopted as fast as we tend to adopt Apple’s products, there are always unintended consequences. When the iPhone came out it was praised as a design and engineering marvel, because it is one, but no one understood what it would be like to have it in our lives. Nobody anticipated the way iPhones exert a constant gravitational tug on our attention. Do I have email? What’s happening on Twitter? Could I get away with playing Tiny Wings at this meeting? When you’re carrying a smartphone, your attention is never entirely undivided. The reality of living with an iPhone, or any smart, connected mobile device, is that it makes reality feel just that little bit less real. One gets overconnected, to the point where one is apt to pay attention to the thoughts and opinions of distant anonymous strangers over those of loved ones who are in the same room. One forgets how to be alone and undistracted. Ironically enough experiences don’t feel fully real till you’ve used your phone to make them virtual–tweeted them or tumbled them or Instagrammed them or YouTubed them–and the world has congratulated you for doing so. The paradox of a wearable device like the Apple Watch is that it both gives you control and takes it away at the same time. Consider the watch’s fitness applications: your body is constantly throwing off data, and now the watch gathers them up and stores and returns them to you in a form you can use. This gives you control over your body that you never had before. The wristwatch made the idea of not knowing the time seem bizarre; in five years it might seem bizarre not to know how many calories you’ve eaten today or what your resting heart rate is. But wearables also ask you to give up control. Once your device starts telling you what you should and shouldn’t eat and how far you should run, it’s getting in between you and your body and mediating that relationship. Wearables will make your physical self visible to the virtual world in the form of information, an indelible digital body print, and that information is going to behave the way any other information behaves these days. It will be copied and circulated. It will go places you don’t expect. People will use that information to track you and market to you. It will be bought and sold and leaked–imagine a data spill comparable to the recent iCloud leak, only with Apple Watch data instead of topless selfies. The Apple Watch is more intimate than other devices, but the Internet isn’t getting any less public. The more of our behavior that ends up online, the more the Internet affects that behavior, and wearables will reach deep into our lives. That’s tremendously empowering, but it also makes us vulnerable to the rampant comparison and gamification that infect any aspect of our lives that becomes public. Just for example, the idea of already body-conscious young women comparing physical data, constantly, in real time, is worrying. Lives lived in public become performances, and even posthumans need to get offstage once in a while. In the center of building 1 of Apple’s cupertino headquarters there is a large-scale replica of the new campus the company is building for itself on a 176-acre patch of land nearby. The Norman Foster–designed project has been nicknamed the spaceship for its circular shape. Like all Apple products, including the watch, the building’s simplicity obscures a lot of painstakingly labored details. It will reportedly use miles of curved glass, and don’t even get the arborist started on the landscaping. When it opens in 2016, Apple Campus 2 will mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but more than anything it will be a temple to the stupendous success of the iPhone. Even if the Apple Watch is a runaway hit, it won’t reach the size of the iPhone business anytime soon. Phones account for more than half of Apple’s total sales: over the past year it has sold more than 163 million of them. During the last holiday season the iPhone alone generated $32.5 billion in revenue, $8 billion more than all of Microsoft. And customers have been growing more satisfied with each new version–90% of iPhone owners expressed “loyalty” to Apple in a March 2014 survey by Morgan Stanley research, up from 73% in December 2011. Though Samsung sells more devices and Google’s Android runs on more phones, Apple remains the pre-eminent brand, by which we mean the most loved. The question about the iPhone isn’t so much the size of the business as its potential for growth. More than 70% of mobile-phone users in the U.S. now own a smartphone, according to comScore, which suggests that the market is close to saturated. Apple’s year-over-year sales have been essentially flat throughout the Americas since the iPhone 5S launched last year. In the world’s most important market, China, the company hasn’t had it easy. Late last year, it reached a deal with China Mobile, the world’s largest wireless carrier, to sell the iPhone. Initial results are promising–Apple’s sales in the country leapt 18% in the first half of 2014 to more than $15 billion. But the company is taking on giants like Lenovo and Huawei on their home turf. And then there’s Xiaomi, a company few Westerners have even heard of but which is routinely called the “Apple of China.” It shipped about 15 million smartphones in the second quarter, which makes it the country’s largest smartphone vendor, according to research firm Canalys. Apple wasn’t even in the top five. Apple’s newest phones should help. The iPhone 6’s 4.7-in. and 5.5-in. models are an acknowledgement that the tastes of mobile users have changed. “Phablets,” devices that straddle the divide between smartphones and tablets, have become more popular. People mocked Samsung when it first unveiled the 5.3-in. Galaxy Note in 2011, but the Korean giant had the last laugh. The third version of the Galaxy Note sold 10 million units in about two months last fall. Just a few days before the Apple Watch event, Samsung pre-emptively announced two new phones with large screens. There’s no question the watch will help the bottom line, and more. Never one to leave a bet unhedged, Apple has grounded its new device in five sectors that are reliably compelling to consumers: social, health, home, fitness and mobile payments. Like the iPod and the iPad before it, the Apple Watch is poised to perform the double feat of creating a market and dominating it in one fell swoop. Piper Jaffray estimates first-year sales at 10 million units. Morgan Stanley puts it at 30 million to 60 million units. Whatever happens, the watch will act as a bulwark to prevent Apple’s share of the phone market from slipping, because an Apple Watch won’t work without an iPhone. Every watch Apple sells will bind consumers more firmly to its closed technological ecosystem. The watch will also help Apple by proving it can still innovate, something that’s been in doubt ever since Jobs passed away. The response from analysts has been ecstatic, and to its credit, Apple has earned it. To build its watch Apple must have evolved internally, from a company driven by a single overbearing executive’s vision to one that reflects the ideas, taste and sensibility of a group rather than an individual. There is no i in Apple Watch. But more than that, more than another decisively imperial annexation of another technological sector, the Apple Watch represents a redrawing of the map that locates technology in one place and our bodies in another. The line between the two will never be as easy to find again. Once you’re O.K. with wearing technology, the only way forward is inward: the next product launch after the Apple Watch would logically be the iMplant. If Apple succeeds in legitimizing wearables as a category, it will have established the founding node in a network that could spread throughout our bodies, with Apple setting the standards. Then we’ll really have to decide how much control we want–and what we’re prepared to give up for it. –WITH REPORTING BY DAN KEDMEY, JACK LINSHI, VICTOR LUCKERSON AND ALEXANDRA SIFFERLIN Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.14258326983046068, "subjectivity_score": 0.4643565132329173},

{"type": "article", "header": "How Taylor Swift Saved Apple Music", "author": "Tim Bajarin", "update_date/publish_date": "June 30, 2015 7:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/3940500/apple-music-taylor-swift-release/", "text": "When I awoke Sunday, I was greeted by multiple stories about Taylor Swift’s open letter to Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook. In the note, she took the company to task for its decision not to pay artists during an initial three-month free trial of Apple Music, the new streaming service Apple’s launching Tuesday. Swift wrote: I’m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company. The letter was polite and to the point. Swift felt it unfair for Apple to use artists, especially up-and-coming ones, to grow its new service without compensating them for it. The counterargument, meanwhile, holds that the free trial could bring lots of free publicity to those same lesser-heard artists. The flaw there, however, is that Apple was asking those artists to make a leap of faith in the hopes of more followers and money in the future — but many small artists live essentially paycheck to paycheck, and they can’t stomach a quarter of reduced payouts. So in one of the most amazing changes of direction I’ve seen in my 35 years of watching Apple, Swift’s letter — and the public show of support it drummed up — got Apple to change its mind. Just hours after the note went up, Apple announced it would indeed be paying artists for their music during the free period, if at a reduced rate (other streaming services have similar practices). You might think Swift’s Apple-shaming would be a public relations disaster for the company — and at first, this is how it was portrayed in the media. But in an ironic twist, Swift’s move was wonderful for Apple and its new music service. Before Swift’s letter, only music and tech industry followers seemed truly aware of Apple Music’s imminent launch. To me, it was clear Apple would need to do lots of promotion to get significant numbers of users on board — die-hard Apple fans might have been good for as many as 15 million users off the bat, but not more than that. Because of Swift’s letter, millions more potential users are now aware of the service. But Swift’s letter did something else for Apple, too. At Fortune, fellow Apple-watcher Philip Elmer-Dewitt wrote that “the Taylor Swift effect continues to ripple across the music industry.” Elmer-Dewitt continued: According to Billboard, two independent music umbrella groups—the digital rights organization Merlin and Martin Mills’ Beggars Group—have dropped their resistance to the new Apple Music streaming service set to begin next week. Merlin and Beggars are long-tail powerhouses. Merlin represents some 20,000 independent music labels and distributors. Beggars, which dates back to the young Rolling Stones, launched the careers of Adele, Jack White, M.I.A. More artists who resisted putting their music on Apple Music are now changing their tune — thanks, in part, to Swift. What Swift ultimately did is create a win-win scenario for herself, Apple, and all artists who now have a powerful outlet to showcase their musical talents. Most of Apple’s competitors have around 15 million paying customers. My firm is predicting Apple will have at least 60 million subscribers by the end of the year, as it can ride iTunes’ massive userbase and the iOS ecosystem to quickly amass a strong audience of listeners. The result of Swift’s letter, then, is that when Apple Music service launches, it will have the richest library of available songs for potential subscribers to check out. And given Apple’s customer base, it could become the most successful streaming music service almost overnight.

I set out to streamline my husband’s and my favorite recipes so they could be made during naptime or any other precious little downtime I had. I nicknamed myself the Naptime Chef and started blogging about these early attempts at simplifying dishes without sacrificing flavor — attempts that led to me scraping more than my fair share of food into the garbage. But with a little practice, I came up with some great family-friendly recipes and in March published my favorites in my first cookbook. Maybe I’ll whip up a sequel after baby No. 2 arrives in January. In the meantime, it’s apple season now, my favorite. I do my best to incorporate the fruit into just about every meal possible. From apple pancakes to apple cheddar soup, name your favorite food and I’ll add apples to it.

The preparation fits so perfectly into our hectic daily routine it makes an apple pie look positively arduous. Why bother coring and slicing half a dozen apples when you can get the same amount of flavor from simply chopping up two of them and pouring some batter into a pie plate? I often whip this cake up before school while my daughter is eating breakfast. It’s delicious and it really can be made whenever you have 10 minutes to spare.

Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter the bottom and sides of an 8-in. pie plate, or baking dish of equal size, and set aside. 2. In a large bowl, add the melted butter and sugar and stir well. Then, stir in the two eggs and the vanilla extract until completely incorporated. 3. While slowly stirring, pour in the flour and kosher salt and stir until the flour is just combined and no longer visible. Do not overmix the batter. 4. Scatter the fruit evenly in the bottom of the buttered baking dish. Pour the batter over the fruit and use a spatula to spread it evenly on top. 5. Bake the cake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a cake tester inserted comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan. Before serving, dust lightly with confectioners’ sugar.

Apple Music, which launches Tuesday, is the tech giant’s most ambitious music project since the original iTunes Store launched in 2003. But unlike the company’s famous digital storefront, Apple Music won’t be selling users individual songs or albums. Instead, customers will pay a monthly subscription fee of about $10 per month for access to tens of millions of songs. It’s a way of listening to music that’s fast becoming the norm thanks to similar offerings by competitors such as Spotify and Google. Though Apple is years late to the party, the company’s arrival signals that streaming is here to stay. Here’s a quick primer on Apple Music and how it differs from the other streaming services on the market. What does Apple Music offer? Apple Music lets users stream songs from Apple’s massive library whenever they want. Users can make playlists or listen to playlists curated by music experts. Tracks can also be downloaded for offline listening. While these are all standard features of most subscription services, Apple is also trying to make it easier for users to seamlessly switch between music in their personal libraries and songs on Apple’s service. Apple Music will automatically upload any tracks in a user’s library that aren’t available on the service to an iCloud account, so they can be streamed from any device — meaning users won’t have to use up lots of space on their phones. Users will be initially be able to store up to 25,000 of their own songs in the cloud; Apple has plans to increase that limit to 100,000 this fall. How much will it cost? A single membership is $9.99 per month, the standard rate for a paid streaming service. Users can also pay $15 per month for a family plan for up to six users. The service is launching with a three-month free trial available to all users. Which devices does Apple Music support? At launch Apple Music will support PC, Mac, Apple Watch and iOS devices that can run iOS 8 or newer. An Android version is coming in the fall. How do I download Apple Music? For iPhone users, simply download the iOS 8.4 update, expected to appear around 11 a.m. ET Tuesday. What features make Apple Music stand out? Apple is launching a live radio station called Beats 1 that will broadcast 24 hours a day. Helmed by former BBC Radio DJ Zane Lowe, the free station will feature shows by stars such as Drake and Elton John, as well as interviews with celebrities like Eminem. Apple Music will also have a feature called Connect that lets artists post behind-the-scenes content and communicate directly with fans. What about exclusive music? It’s likely Apple will try to leverage its considerable clout and deep pockets to line up many exclusive releases for its music service. Already Taylor Swift has said her hit album 1989 will be available for streaming for the first time ever through Apple Music. Dr. Dre’s The Chronic will also make its streaming debut on Apple’s service (Dre began working for Apple after the company bought his company Beats Electronics for $3 billion last year). Expect similar deals in the future. Which features is Apple Music missing? Spotify remains the best service for making music-listening social thanks to its collaborative playlists and tight integration with Facebook. Apple hasn’t mentioned either feature being part of Apple Music. Apple’s service will also reportedly stream at a maximum bitrate of 256 kbps, which is below the 320 kbps that Spotify, Google Play Music, Tidal and Rdio all offer. Whether or not average users will notice or care about that difference remains to be seen. What if I don’t want to pay for a subscription service? Apple Music offers the live station, as well as artist and genre-specific Internet radio stations similar to Pandora, for free. Google Play Music and Rdio also have free tiers that offer Internet radio rather than on-demand streaming. Spotify remains the most fully-featured free ad-supported service as desktop users can play any song on demand for free while mobile users can build playlists to be enjoyed in random order.

We begin to do less. We begin to think about things less. We begin to modify how we think. In a world like that where we’re restraining ourselves, it changes society in a major way.” Cook went on to say that it’s difficult to argue that people shouldn’t own their own private data. “It’s tough to say that a company, or anyone for that matter, should be able to step in and on an uninformed basis vacuum up your data,” he said. “That’s a large concern of mine.” Apple has made protecting privacy—at least for its Western customers—the centerpiece of its marketing strategy, as it works to differentiate itself from the other big Silicon Valley players like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, whose business models thrive on leveraging users’ personal data. Cook also spoke about his decision to publicly come out as gay in 2014, explaining that he made the choice despite knowing it would lead to a loss of his own privacy. “The reason I did this is because I wanted to help young people. I saw what was going on was the LGBTQ community was being bullied terribly,” he said. “I thought if I can only help one person by telling the world that I’m gay and that I’m proud of it, that I should do it and put my own desire for privacy to the side.” When asked what calculations went into his decision, Cook said he weighed a number of different things: “How people would hear it, how people would perceive it. I did worry about it pulling attention off of our products and what we’re about. But at the end of the day, I felt like I was in a position to do a lot of good….The big downside was my own privacy. It was something I was giving up myself, so you could sort of see that trade-off I was going to make.” The TIME100 Summit is the live event extension of the annual TIME100 list of the most influential people in the world. It convenes leaders from the global TIME100 community to spotlight solutions and encourage action toward a better world. This year’s summit features a variety of impactful speakers across a diverse range of sectors, including politics, business, health and science, culture, and more. Speakers for the 2022 TIME100 Summit include producer Mindy Kaling, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation co-chair Bill Gates, filmmaker Taika Waititi, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, musician Jon Batiste, Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley, NBA champion, entrepreneur, and philanthropist Dwayne Wade, former U.S. Rep.

According to Apple, the technology will be designed and built in facilities across the country, including in Fort Collins, Colorado, where Broadcom has a major facility. “Apple already helps support more than 1,100 jobs in Broadcom’s Fort Collins FBAR filter manufacturing facility, and the partnership will enable Broadcom to continue to invest in critical automation projects and upskilling with technicians and engineers,” Apple said in a statement on Tuesday.  The announcement comes as the U.S. continues to turn its attention towards domestic semiconductor production in an effort to reduce American companies’ reliance on foreign chipmakers. Last summer, President Biden signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, one of the biggest federal investments in a private industry, which includes $52 billion in subsidies for domestic chip manufacturers, $24 billion to fund a tax credit for new semiconductor manufacturing facilities, and more than $170 billion over five years to boost U.S. scientific research.  The vast majority of advanced semiconductors are manufactured in China and Taiwan, which many U.S. officials viewed as a national security concern. Pandemic-spurred supply chain shocks that triggered a semiconductor shortage also exposed global reliance on a few key players for chips that are essential in the electronics and automotive industries, in particular.  “All of Apple’s products depend on technology engineered and built here in the United States, and we’ll continue to deepen our investments in the U.S. economy because we have an unshakable belief in America’s future,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. The U.S. isn’t the only country seeking to reduce its dependence on Asian chipmakers. Member states of the European Union agreed their own €43 billion ($46 billion) Chips Act to boost semiconductor production in the bloc, while the U.K. also unveiled its £1 billion ($1.2 billion) semiconductor strategy in recent days.

Should it be the CEO’s humiliation on Wednesday at the hands of American senators, who told him he “had blood on his hands” and prompted him to turn and contritely address the relatives of young people whose tragic deaths, those relatives believe, were the result of using his company’s products? Or should it be what happened Thursday, when Meta announced vast corporate earnings and its stock the next day soared, adding $197 billion to its overall valuation—more in one day than had any company, ever? The answer, of course, is both. The unprecedented journey of this society-altering corporate behemoth continues in ways that are almost as hard to comprehend and digest as the generative artificial intelligence technology it is racing to deploy. This company’s genuine financial and business success is, at the same time, a tragedy of world-historical proportions. Read more: Here’s What We Know About Mark Zuckerberg’s Net Worth That’s because Facebook and its parent company Meta have truly harmed the world. That it has also been uniquely profitable in the course of doing that is not a coincidence. The willful omission of sufficient guardrails makes everything on Meta’s services go faster, including profit. The company this week announced a $50 billion share buyback alongside huge quarterly earnings. It even launched a shareholder dividend, unusual for a still fast-growing company. Zuckerberg himself, by far the largest stockholder, is set to earn around $700 million a year from that dividend. I have had a unique perspective on this saga because I was the first journalist to seriously engage with the company’s story, starting in September 2006 when it had a mere 9 million users. (As of the end of 2023, Meta’s various services had a total of 3.98 billion users. The number it directly affects will surpass half the planet’s population in the very near future.) After meeting Zuckerberg for lunch back then in midtown Manhattan, I wrote an article for Fortune entitled “Why Facebook Matters,” which impressed the then 22-year-old Zuckerberg and led, eventually, to a 2010 book chronicling the company’s already-remarkable story, The Facebook Effect. So I’ve watched carefully as Zuckerberg evolved from an ambitious and generally decent young man into someone I view as a cold-blooded and amoral schemer whose successes are the envy of his fellow capitalists. This 20-year chronicle is entirely about him. He is not just a talented visionary and business leader. Because he has had total control of his globe-spanning enterprise and has led it without sufficient concern for its effects on the world, his culpability for those effects is uniquely large. In the last day or so I’ve read several judicious and relatively neutral essays in the business press marking Facebook’s 20th anniversary. But they just didn’t capture the sheer oddity and awfulness of the company’s story. It’s critical people not underestimate the awful part. I was deeply struck by how the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken analyzed what’s going wrong with the world in a conversation with Tom Friedman of The New York Times a few weeks ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “The biggest poison that we face around the world internally in our societies and externally in our relations with others,” Blinken said, “is dehumanization—the inability to see the humanity in the other.” He was talking about the tragedy of Israel and Gaza as well as Ukraine and even U.S.-China relations. But he could as easily have been talking about the dynamic in the cafeteria of any high school on the planet, or among the alumni of Zuckerberg’s alma mater Harvard, for that matter. In my opinion, Zuckerberg played a major part in worsening that shift towards hatred, intolerance, and the attempted cancellation of those we don’t agree with. It’s not that Zuckerberg wants the world to be fractured. It’s more that he didn’t realize it mattered until it was too late, more or less around the time Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. He won with the help, in part, of disingenuous Facebook ads paid in rubles from Russia and strategically targeted at voters in critical swing counties in Wisconsin and Michigan. By then, though, Zuckerberg was the richest person his age in history. It seems to me he became more concerned with maintaining that status than doing what would be necessary to reduce the polarizing and dehumanizing effects of his company’s systems. Read more: Mark Zuckerberg Is Reportedly Building an Underground Bunker in Hawaii Of course, there are also innumerable good and even great social and political impacts of these systems. This is the most popular media in the world because people enjoy using these services. It’s just another complication when assessing the macro impact of this company. But we don’t prevent someone from going to jail for murder just because they volunteer at a homeless shelter. I spend a lot of time asking myself why Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp have contributed so horribly to the rise of autocrats and to the epidemic of teen suicide and self-harm, just to mention two especially tragic effects. In part, it's because this company seemingly built its systems from the beginning with far more concern about their ability to generate clicks and attention than about governance mechanisms that might mitigate their harmful impacts. For example, in 2008, the company introduced systems to enable its users in countries around the world to themselves translate Facebook’s English into their local languages, which people everywhere promptly did. Yet Facebook had no employees who spoke most of those languages or who were assigned to ensure their speakers were not harming each other. That remains the case, to this day, in many languages. In Myanmar, an official U.N. inquiry concluded that Facebook disinformation and harassment contributed to genocide. The harms also continue because, despite the umbrage of the senators and their peers in numerous other countries, governments and regulators have notoriously failed to sufficiently assess and restrain this company and other social media giants. The European Union is beginning to establish laws that can be models for other jurisdictions, but it’s too little too late. But there’s another way to understand why Facebook and so many other social media companies have such a pernicious socio-cultural effect. It’s because these systems were not designed with a sufficient appreciation for the toxic impact of human ego and emotion. Fifteen or 20 years ago, I wrote a regular email column for Fortune. I occasionally tackled unpopular topics, like outsourcing American manufacturing, which I suggested might not always be so bad. In reply, I got some scathingly critical emails from readers, calling me terrible names. Sometimes I would email them back, saying I was sorry they felt that way and adding a bit of further explanation. Often, probably more often than not, I would then receive a far less hyperbolic note from the reader, thanking me for my note. But such an exchange is far less likely on social media. That’s because much of the  interaction happens in public. And in public, people have a reputation to maintain. When you speak in front of an audience, as one does on Facebook or Instagram, you want to impress your friends and those you hope are your admirers. We play to our audience. Concessions and efforts to find concord are not what we expect. And as Blinken notes, we too often demonize the other, and polarization worsens. So happy birthday, Meta. Not. Your shareholders may be celebrating, but the rest of us should not be naive. Much of your impact on our world is not happy.

I live away from my family, the site says. I’m a frequent traveler. I’m interested in real estate, engineering, chemistry and hotels. I enjoy the German death metal band Obscura. They’re associated with the bands Suffocation and Pestilence — at least that’s what Wikipedia told me, because I had to look them up. Truth be told, I got a “C” in high school chemistry, I haven’t been on a plane in about a year and I’m not into death metal — German or otherwise. Yet for some reason, Facebook not only thinks this is who I am, it’s also what the social network tells its advertisers about me. I learned this by combing through my Facebook ad preferences, something any of the service’s users can do. And while some of Facebook’s data points made sense and seemed even reasonable to collect, others (like that I’m a “close friend of expats,” the site says) are more than unsettling — they could be damaging if used by advertisers the wrong way. The big problem currently facing Facebook is making this point in a horrific way. According to 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, Russia used social media to influence the 2016 presidential election. This is jarring and alarming because about two-thirds of Americans get their news from social media, says a Pew Research Center survey. And now Facebook, the largest and most influential social network with more than two billion users, is being threatened by Congress with regulations over how it presents political ads. The concern is that outside actors, like Russia, can manipulate the popular social network, and in turn, influence the thoughts and opinions of its users. You know, regular people like you and me, posting things about their cats and Pumpkin Spice Lattes. If you’ve been purposefully disconnected following November 8, 2016, here’s what we’ve learned since the election: The F.B.I. and other U.S. intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia used social media to influence the election. According to Facebook’s internal investigations, approximately 500 Russia-linked accounts bought 3,000 ads worth about $100,000 during the 2016 campaign. Targeting issues like Islam, gun ownership and the Black Lives Matter movement, these ads were specifically aimed at swing states and intended to sow discord. But virality being what it is, 10 million people saw the ads, says Facebook. On November 1, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google will testify publicly before Congress. And soon the Facebook ads in question will be publicly released. As forthcoming as Facebook may be with Congress both publicly and behind closed doors, it’s unlikely the company will speak plainly about everything users might want it to. For instance, when it comes to advertising, the bread and butter that accounted for Facebook’s $26 billion in revenue in 2016, the company is tight-lipped. It’s a no-brainer that when you “like” something such as Mr. Bean on Facebook — which, amazingly in 2017, 75 million people do — the social network collects that data and uses it to curate content and ads, making the site more relevant. And when you’re served an ad, you can even click on a discrete drop-down menu to see why it targeted you specifically. But advertisers can use the information Facebook users provide in unsettling ways. For instance, recent reporting by ProPublica showed how repugnant terms that users had put on their profiles, like “NaziParty,” “how to burn jews,” and “jew hater,” later appeared in Facebook’s ad targeting system. There have been no known cases where advertisers used this information to sell anti-Semitic targeted ads, but it’s possible that they could have. Instead, it’s more likely that advertisers, like the Russian-linked accounts looking to game the social network, used more common and socially acceptable interests to reach users who were susceptible to being influenced by controversial messaging. In other words, if you “like” the National Rifle Association or Planned Parenthood on Facebook, there’s a chance you got played. And if I hadn’t taken the time to clean up my own ad preferences, I could have been one of them. For the most part, my Facebook ad preferences are tame. I’m conservative with what I “like” on Facebook: I don’t let friends tag me in posts or photos, and I purposely try not to like anything with bias or controversy. In fact, I’m so fastidious with my Facebook that of the roughly 175 advertising data points the company lists about me, they completely miss the fact that I’m an enormous Red Sox and Star Wars fan. (I can only imagine all that marketing I’m “missing.”) Still, with how regimented I am, it makes no sense that Facebook thinks I like racewalking (I don’t), vikings (not interested), leather (I’m more of a fleece guy), and finance (you’re kidding, right?). What the heck is going on here? The answer may be one of the social network’s closer-held secrets. Facebook works with a number of third-party data providers, forging partnerships that make the seemingly all-knowing website even smarter. The company doesn’t reveal what information it culls about us from those services — that’s Facebook’s secret sauce — culminating in a stance that irks privacy experts. And the company is unlikely to detail any of this research when it testifies before Congress next month. In fact, don’t expect Facebook to give us access to the full scope of our own information any time soon. Instead, in the coming days, we’ll see the ads that the Russian-backed accounts bought to divide us. And when we look at them, it’ll be like peering in a mirror, only the faces staring back will be shrewder. They’ll know exactly how all those nonchalant or impassioned “likes” have been turned against us. And like ideas trapped behind a looking glass, all they’ll tell us is what’s been there all along, hiding in plain sight. Until Facebook is forced to disclosed the full scope of its knowledge of users — as well as the means through which it gathers that information — lingering questions will outnumber answers. And in demanding those answers, our voices are fundamentally diminished. We aren’t Facebook’s customers, after all, we’re its products. And that’s what Russia — I mean Facebook — has known about us all along. John Patrick Pullen has written about smart devices and home automation for TIME and Fortune since 2009.

In their shadow, several yellow construction vehicles sit beside mounds of upturned soil and the skeleton of a half-built warehouse. On a May afternoon this year, a group of women in blue and pink uniforms hurried from one building to another over the din of traffic and construction.  This factory complex in Sriperumbudur, an industrial town in Tamil Nadu state, is one of Apple’s most important iPhone assembly hubs outside of China. It is operated by Foxconn, a Taiwan-based electronics manufacturing company. Three times per day, the gates to this factory open to swallow buses ferrying thousands of workers—around three-quarters of them women. These workers spend eight hours per day, six days per week, on a humming assembly line, soldering components, turning screws, or operating machinery. The factory is one of the biggest iPhone plants in India, with some 17,000 employees who churn out 6 million iPhones every year. And it’s fast expanding. Most of the 232 million iPhones Apple sold in 2022 came from factories in China, with many of them originating from a single massive Foxconn facility in Zhengzhou. But shifting geopolitical tides have recently forced Apple to re-evaluate its exposure to China. First came the pandemic, when Beijing’s harsh lockdowns badly disrupted global supply chains. Now U.S. intelligence assessments, made public this year, say that Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his military to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027, and President Biden has said the U.S. would defend Taiwan in that scenario. A hot war with China could have disastrous consequences, not only for the world, but also for Apple’s ability to manufacture many of the products behind its $2.7 trillion business.  And so the company is hedging its bets on India, a country shielded from China behind the world’s highest mountain range, and home to a young population of 1.4 billion people. In September 2022, Apple announced the iPhone 14 would be assembled in India for the first time. (Until then, the Sriperumbudur factory handled only older models.) In April of this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook flew to India, where he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pledged to invest ever more deeply in the country, and personally opened two Apple Stores. Now, workers at the Sriperumbudur factory are reportedly assembling the new iPhone 15, which went on sale in September. Powering Apple’s pivot to India is Foxconn. By 2024, Foxconn hopes to nearly quadruple its production at this South Indian factory to 20 million iPhones per year, and reportedly plans to hire tens of thousands more workers to make that possible. Satellite images provided to TIME by Planet Labs show rapid expansion at the complex, with three new factory buildings constructed over the past two years and newly broken ground on space large enough to accommodate at least three more. Apple could manufacture 25% of all iPhones in India by 2025, up from just 5% in 2022, according to a JPMorgan analysis. This shift toward India has winners and losers. Foxconn has a history of low pay, harsh working conditions, and exacting targets in its Chinese factories. And as Foxconn rushed into India to meet Apple’s demand, it created comparable conditions there. In 2021, 159 factory workers were hospitalized with food poisoning, as a result of eating unhygienic food at a subcontractor-provided hostel. That incident set off a wave of protests that, for several days, drew media attention to the squalid living conditions faced by iPhone assembly workers. The hospitalizations were followed by a government inspection into the factory—which has not previously been reported—that described numerous safety risks and workers’-rights violations. That government inspection, carried out in December 2021, prompted Foxconn to spend $1.6 million on improving health and safety in the factory with oversight from Apple and the state government of Tamil Nadu, Foxconn said in a statement to TIME.  This story is based on an unreleased government document reviewed by TIME, as well as interviews this spring with four current workers and eight community organizers in and around Foxconn’s Sriperumbudur factory. All workers spoke on condition of anonymity, out of fear that speaking to the media would invite retaliation. “What we do in this factory is not what we studied for,” one female worker told TIME. “But it has become a matter of survival for our families.” Apple declined TIME’s request for a reporter to be given a tour of the Sriperumbudur factory for this story, and refused two requests to make a senior executive available for an interview. Foxconn did not respond to similar requests. In a statement, an Apple spokesperson said that the issues at the Sriperumbudur factory were addressed after the food-poisoning incident, and added that regular Apple audits have found that the conditions in the factory are continually improving. Foxconn said the health and safety of its employees is “a top priority.”  At 9 a.m. on Dec. 17, 2021, two days after the food-poisoning incident, a health and safety inspector from the Tamil Nadu state government turned up at the gates of the iPhone factory in Sriperumbudur.  The inspection found that six workers whose job was to manually solder iPhone parts together “were not provided with protective equipment” including safety goggles, chemical-resistant gloves, or respirators, according to a letter sent by the government inspector to Foxconn, a copy of which was reviewed by TIME. In the areas of the factory where soldering was carried out, the inspection found, the ventilation system was not sufficient to prevent “the escape and spread of toxic fumes into the working environment.” That soldering process, the letter said, was “highly hazardous to the health of workers.”  In another part of the factory, the inspector found that workers “were not provided with suitable goggles to protect their eyes from the excessive light and infrared radiation.” He identified 77 pieces of automated machinery that were missing crucial “interlock” mechanisms on their doors to prevent operation under dangerous conditions, and 262 instances of missing guards on pressing machinery. The lack of these protective mechanisms, the letter said, posed a risk of bodily injury. And six large industrial ovens used to attach tiny electrical components to iPhone circuit boards, the letter said, had not been “tested by a competent person” before factory workers were expected to use them. Read More: How India’s Record-Breaking Population Will Shape the World The inspection also found several apparent employment-law violations, according to the letter. At least 11 workers in the factory, it said, had been required to work excessively high hours for the past three months. At least 17 workers had been required to work on Sundays—usually their only weekly day off—without being given a replacement day of leave within three days. “All latrines and urinals in the factory were not maintained in clean and sanitary conditions at all times,” the letter said, and debris was present on the ground floor of the factory that presented a safety risk. The factory manager had failed to keep a register of workers in the factory or a register of their wages, the inspector claimed. And more than 4,500 of the 6,126 workers in the factory at the time of inspection were allegedly employed not by Foxconn, but by 11 different subcontractors that were not legally registered with the Tamil Nadu directorate of industrial safety and health.  The letter suggests that the inspector found multiple violations of state law. The same findings would also likely constitute violations of Apple’s 127-page “supplier code of conduct” which—on paper—guarantees the people who build iPhones the right to dignified work in a safe environment. This code says that Apple suppliers must provide “safe working conditions” including by providing personal protective equipment, ensuring adequate ventilation, and maintaining proper safety mechanisms on machinery. Any overtime must be voluntary, the document says. Workers should receive at least one day off per seven days, it adds, and have access to clean toilet facilities. Apple does not prevent its contractors from using third-party labor agencies to supply workers, but says these agencies must be legally registered. “Any violations of this Code may jeopardize a supplier’s business relationship with Apple up to and including termination,” Apple’s supplier code of conduct states. The Tamil Nadu inspector’s letter to Foxconn warned that “suitable action” would be taken against it within seven days, unless the company could explain why it “should not be prosecuted for the irregularities found” during the inspection. TIME was not able to confirm what measures, if any, the Tamil Nadu state government took in the aftermath of the letter. The Tamil Nadu directorate of industrial safety and health, which carried out the inspection, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The day after the inspection, Foxconn closed the factory. Shortly after, Apple sent in a team of independent auditors. But in public statements at the time, neither company mentioned that a government inspector had described a litany of failings inside the massive factory complex. Instead, both Apple and Foxconn issued statements saying that they were concerned by the hygiene failures at off-site hostels, and that they would quickly work to address the conditions there. The statements gave the impression that the main risk to workers’ health and safety came from hostels run by subcontractors—not from Foxconn’s very own factory floor. The factory remained closed for nearly a month, and a phased reopening began on Jan. 12, 2022.  In their statements to TIME for this story, Apple and Foxconn acknowledged that an inspection took place at the factory but did not comment on specific findings. “We took measures and addressed every issue the government raised from its inspection,” a Foxconn spokesperson said in a statement to TIME, without specifying what those issues were. “The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for Foxconn.” An Apple spokesperson also declined to comment on specific findings. “The issues at Foxconn Sriperumbudur were investigated and addressed a year and a half ago and we placed the facility on probation,” the spokesperson said in a statement to TIME in May. “During this period Foxconn invested in significant improvements and through quarterly, and at times weekly audits, Apple and independent auditors have tracked meaningful upgrades to the facility with frequent visits and employee interviews.” Apple-run surveys found employee satisfaction at the factory to have increased by 27% between August and December 2022, the spokesperson said. Foxconn implemented some positive changes in the months after the inspection, protests, and factory closure, according to three workers who spoke with TIME. Foxconn removed a rule that workers had to live in subcontractor-provided hostels, and increased workers’ salaries by 5,000 rupees ($60) per month to cover the costs associated with renting accommodations independently. Both the food in the factory’s canteen and the working conditions on the factory floor have improved since the protests, the workers said, while acknowledging that significant problems remain. Since the factory shut down and reopened, four current workers told TIME in May, it is generally a safer place to work. The same workers, however, complained of high production targets, as well as a system of subcontracting that in effect creates a two-tier workplace where a comparatively small number of Foxconn employees enjoy greater benefits and job security than a legion of temporary workers, hired by third-party Indian subcontractors, who also work inside the factory. (Three of the current workers TIME spoke with were employed via subcontractors; one was a Foxconn employee.) While the workers TIME spoke to agreed that conditions in the factory had improved since the 2021 protests and subsequent inspection, they also said that many problems persist. One problem three workers mentioned was their wages: ranging from 82 to 101 rupees per hour for slightly different roles inside the factory, equivalent to between $0.99 and $1.22 per hour. While such wages are more than double Tamil Nadu’s minimum wage for electronics workers, and still better than the perils of unemployment or work in India’s vast informal sector, they give workers little opportunity to move up the economic ladder, especially since many of them have children and elderly parents to support. “In the Indian context, this is not a terrible wage. It’s not a fair wage, but it doesn’t shock me,” says Ramapriya Gopalakrishnan, a labor lawyer based in the nearby city of Chennai. To rent a room in the towns surrounding the factory would cost around one-third of a worker’s monthly paycheck, she says. “To support two kids in school on top of that, and support a mother and father, it would be very difficult.” Read More: The Workers Behind AI Rarely See Its Rewards. This Indian Startup Wants to Fix That Before the beginning of each daily shift at Foxconn’s Sriperumbudur factory, Foxconn managers announce production targets. Some days, according to two assembly-line workers, the targets can require each worker to work on as many as 520 iPhones per hour—or one every seven seconds. At those rates, each worker on the production line could handle some $4 million worth of iPhones every day. Every worker on this assembly line has a designated task. Some are experts at attaching a specific component to the iPhone’s motherboard. Others have learned the precise finger movements necessary to tighten an individual screw. At regular stages some workers perform quality checks, to make sure nothing has gone wrong as each phone barrels from one point along the assembly line to the next.  Meena, a contract worker on the factory floor, says she spends eight hours per day, six days per week, hunched over her station, fingers constantly in movement. “Some days, I don’t even get time to go to the restroom because I have to meet my production targets,” she says. “If the supervisor notices that products are piling up on the conveyor belt at my stage, he will reprimand me.” Her delicate task—the specifics of which, like her real name, TIME is not revealing in order to protect her identity—causes pain in her fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, and back, Meena says. If she changes her position to alleviate the pain—for example by crossing her legs—a supervisor will often hassle her to sit properly, she says. Foxconn allows workers facing health issues to take short rests and provides them with over-the-counter pain medication, Meena says. But after her rest break, Meena says she is still expected to continue at a demanding pace for the rest of the day.  Meena is not employed directly by Foxconn. Instead, like many of her colleagues in the factory, she is employed by a third-party contractor. This system is not unique to Foxconn, according to Gopalakrishnan, the labor lawyer. It’s common in the Indian manufacturing sector, she says, because it helps factory owners maintain a flexible workforce to which they bear few legal obligations.  “Unlike fixed-term employees, these so-called contract laborers do not know even whether they can earn their livelihood beyond tomorrow—that is the degree of uncertainty we are talking about,” says Gopalakrishnan. “This whole contract labor system is designed to lower labor costs and evade responsibility for compliance with labor laws.” At the Sriperumbudur factory, contract workers do not receive sick leave or vacation days, and are not given copies of their contracts, according to three who spoke with TIME. Foxconn earlier this year instituted a new policy there, the workers said, whereby if contract workers take leave on a consecutive Monday and Saturday, their monthly salary will be docked by 1,500 rupees ($18), the equivalent of several days’ pay. And if workers take three days of consecutive leave, their salary will be docked 5,000 rupees ($60), the workers said.  This appears to describe more violations of Apple’s supplier code of conduct. Apple says in the document that it holds its suppliers to the “highest standard” of labor. It specifically says that they must not use wage deductions as a form of discipline, must not prevent workers from taking bathroom breaks, and must take steps to mitigate “ergonomic hazards” including painful postures and repetitive movements. In statements to TIME, neither Foxconn nor Apple commented on the allegations of wage deductions, poorer conditions for contract laborers, ergonomic hazards, or high production targets. “We work with relevant local agencies to ensure that all recruitment efforts follow Foxconn’s recruitment standards and guidelines, as well as local labor regulations,” a Foxconn spokesperson said. “Foxconn communicates and cooperates with stakeholders, wherever we are, to continuously create an operating environment that is healthy and competitive, while protecting the rights and interest of our employees.” “We have the highest standards in the industry for our suppliers and regularly assess their compliance to our code of conduct,” an Apple spokesperson said. “With multiple feedback channels, including employee surveys and anonymous reporting, we are constantly looking for ways to raise the bar even further.” Back at the perimeter of the Foxconn factory complex, past the mounds of dirt and the skeletal frame of the half-constructed warehouse, beyond a security hut manned by guards in white shirts, are two rows of what appear to be worker housing buildings. Both rows are four stories high and 100 meters long, and lined with concrete balconies. These buildings may be a taste of what is to come. With Apple keen to ramp up iPhone production in India, Foxconn is reportedly planning to build huge hostels for as many as 60,000 workers near its Sriperumbudur factory. Construction is currently under way on a large plot of land inside the Foxconn complex. As a result, workers at the factory are concerned that Foxconn may again require its employees to live in company-run hostels, and could revoke the 5,000-rupee ($60) housing allowance that it currently pays its workers to cover the cost of their outside accommodation, according to three workers who spoke with TIME. (Foxconn declined to comment on its plans.) Meanwhile, the most expensive iPhone 14 retails for $999. The most expensive iPhone 15 retails at $1,099. While Apple does not publicly disclose the difference between an iPhone’s final sale price and how much it costs to produce, the company’s most recent financial results say that for every dollar of income from product sales, the company makes around 35¢ as profit.  The four workers at the Sriperumbudur factory who spoke to TIME said that while it’s unlikely they would easily find higher wages elsewhere, they still feel they deserve better. It would take the lowest-paid among them around six months to save enough to buy a single iPhone 15—and that’s if the worker never paid for rent, food, or to support her family. “When I compare my salary to the cost of an iPhone, obviously they can pay me better,” one young woman says.   —With reporting by Barath Raj/Sriperumbudur and Varsha Bansal/Bengaluru Write to Billy Perrigo/Sriperumbudur, India at billy.perrigo@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/6248790/india-population-data-china/", "https://time.com/6297403/the-workers-behind-ai-rarely-see-its-rewards-this-indian-startup-wants-to-fix-that/"], "sentiment_score": 0.05870692039442038, "subjectivity_score": 0.4264485815110818},

As denouements go it wasn’t particularly dramatic. It’s hard to tell who even won. The FBI had been asking for Apple’s help accessing data on an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack. Apple had been asking the FBI to kindly back the hell up, because they felt (with some justification) that developing a tool to get into an iPhone would compromise the security on all iPhones. And, moreover, that the legal guidelines as to when the government can and can’t ask for encrypted data on your iPhone needed to be clarified. The situation was supposed to come to a boil in court Tuesday March 22, but didn’t because the FBI announced that it was working with an outside firm to get into the phone without Apple’s help. Yesterday the agency announced that it had succeeded. MORE: The Full Transcript of TIME’s Interview With Apple CEO Tim Cook It’s hard to call this one for either side. The FBI got its data, whatever it was, we still don’t know. Apple got to stick to its principles—I spoke to Cook for a TIME cover story two weeks ago, when it was abundantly clear that there was no way Cook was going to give an inch on this one, unless the law compelled him to. Apple would’ve liked to take this issue to Congress and get the legal landscape clarified; it didn’t get that. The FBI didn’t get to set the legal precedents it sought either. The FBI did salvage an angstrom of pride by opening the phone without Apple’s help. The whole saga had served as an extended advertisement for the strength of the iPhone’s security, and conversely it was making the FBI look technologically weak. (Following the saga, you couldn’t help thinking that the NSA would’ve dipped into some secret stash of zero-day vulnerabilities and cracked the phone on day one.) The FBI still doesn’t have premium bragging rights, since it had to turn to an outside firm for help—the rumor mill names an Israeli mobile data firm called Cellebrite. A federal database does show a contract between the FBI and Cellebrite, for unspecified services, for which Cellebrite billed the government $15,278.02. Apple is undoubtedly smarting at the news that that’s all it costs to crack an iPhone.  (It’s worth noting that the ACLU has been arguing for weeks that the FBI never needed Apple’s help in the first place, that there is a known path to decrypting the data, and that the FBI’s whole legal onslaught was an opportunistic attempt to set a legal precedent using a case, domestic terrorism, that would draw a lot of public sympathy. There’s an alternative story here, in which the FBI read the tea leaves and didn’t like its chances in court, so it backed off and went for the technological solution.) MORE: Inside Apple’s Fight With the FBI The Justice Department has made it clear, in a statement, that this isn’t over, that this was just round one, and that the next time it gets stuck with a phone full of evidence it’ll be right back on Apple’s doorstep. Apple made it clear in a statement that its position remained unchanged; it’s likely that sooner or later it will get its day in court. Even though Apple’s products wound up looking that less secure, the outcome does strengthen Apple’s reputation as a defender of privacy, and its claim that strong encryption isn’t a security disaster. At the end of the day it’s rare for mobile data to be completely and totally inaccessible. Terrorists worldwide declined to issue a statement, but they were undoubtedly watching this all unfold. Hopefully they feel a little less safe, so at least we can agree who lost.

{"type": "article", "header": "Why a $1,000 iPhone Isn’t as Crazy as It Sounds", "author": "John Patrick Pullen", "update_date/publish_date": "September 12, 2017 8:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4934673/iphone-8-price/", "text": "It’s iPhone day, the annual non-holiday where smartphone addicts cozy up to Apple’s keynote to find out what the touchscreen fairies are bringing good little fanboys and girls. If you’re like me, you’ve been waiting with especially bated breath, because your handset is several years old, loses power faster than an overthrown dictator and inexplicably smells like fish tacos. In other words, it’s upgrade time, baby, and we all deserve the latest and greatest. This time around, however, Apple’s top-of-the-line iPhone will probably be more expensive than in years past. In addition to trumpeting an exciting array of new features, the rumor mill has been spinning claims that Apple’s next must-have handset could cost as much as $1,000. That’s 147 pieces of avocado toast! And like that mortgage-busting breakfast option, the question everyone has about the new iPhone is: Will it be worth it? Here, absent final specs, are four reasons I think it will be, and one reason it won’t. The first is a matter of economics. Most people don’t remember this, but when Steve Jobs revealed the first iPhone, the device’s steep $599 price tag was practically bigger news than its beautiful 3.5-inch, 320-by-480 pixel screen. (I remember what a big deal this was, because I was gifted one by a very generous family member.) In 2017 dollars, that handset would cost $707 — but that’s not the whole financial story. Apple’s first-ever iPhone was introduced on January 9, 2007 and released at the end of the following June. In the interim, the world (which had been used to paying around $99 for cellphones) went crazy speculating about whether anyone would actually buy the thing. But just five days after the iPhone was released, Apple had sold one million units. The takeaway: people will pay big for a new gadget if it’s extraordinary enough. Second, the new iPhone is rumored to have exciting new features that more than offset the $300 difference between the original iPhone’s adjusted cost and the new one’s potential price tag. Some people are moonstruck over the possibility of slender bezels, a full-frontal touch screen and a disappearing home button. But to me, the only thing that truly matters with any new iPhone is how I’ll use it. In that sense, Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone will reportedly be more powerful than anything you’ve clutched to browse Instagram or Facebook while using the toilet at work. (And like the iPhone 7, this new iPhone should be waterproof, too.) Beyond its big, beautiful slab of uninterrupted glass, the most valuable features on the new iPhone will be its updated cameras. On the front, the FaceTime camera will likely be better than ever (because it almost always is). Leaked schematics say the front-facing camera will be accompanied by new expression detection technology and something called “ARFaceAnchor,” which is a short way of saying “Snapchat filters for the rest of us.” If you want to send a video of your face morphing into the heart eyes emoji to your special someone, you may be able to do that with a simple text message and not a social networking app. (All while keeping your mug off social media? Priceless.) That sounds fun, sure, but there’s a practical purpose behind beefing up the FaceTime camera. To keep the new phone’s front seamless, Apple reportedly ditched the old, mechanical Home button, replacing fingerprint scanning with facial recognition to unlock the device. Creepy? Maybe. But winter is coming, and having artificial intelligence scan your mug to hail an Uber works far better than having to take your mittens off to thumb your Touch ID sensor in the middle of a blizzard. Even more important: My young ones look nothing like their old man, so in this new iPhone, I’ll finally have a mobile phone smart enough to keep my kids locked out. Apple’s new iPhone will probably have a better quality back-facing camera, too. The rumor mill expects it to be capable of shooting 4K video at 60 frames per second (up from the current top-end 4K at 30fps), perfect for capturing my little one’s first steps, my oldest’s first home run, or my neighbor’s sad attempts at parallel parking. The new iPhone is also rumored to have some sort of “smart cam” technology, essentially an A.I.-powered version of automatic exposure that instantly optimizes for different subjects like babies, fireworks, snow, sunsets or documents. People don’t buy point-and-shoot cameras anymore, but if they did, they’d easily drop several hundred bucks for something decent. So why not justify the outlay on an improved iPhone camera instead? The third reason the new iPhone will be worth its price is because buying the most powerful Apple device you can afford is almost always the best policy. In the near term, buying a higher-powered iPhone will give you better computing power, whether it comes from a faster processor, a bigger stack of memory chips, or even a better camera. And in the long term, when you eventually resell that handset to upgrade to whatever Apple dreams up next, you’ll get more money in return than if you bought the basement level version. Think about it. If you were in the market for a used iPhone today, which would you rather buy: an iPhone 7, or an iPhone 6s? If you opt instead to hold onto your once-mighty handset, it’ll be even more useful than an underpowered model. When I upgrade gadgets like tablets and computers, I almost always sell my old models on eBay, but never smartphones. With all the personal data they now collect, to say nothing of all the clever alternative things you can do with an old iPhone, they’ve become too valuable to pawn. The last reason the new iPhone will undoubtedly be worth its price is that all its newfangled features combined will turn it into a powerhouse for Augmented Reality. Long-hyped by Apple, AR promises to give us new ways to look at (and interact with) the world. How exactly that pans out is going to depend on the apps themselves, but peeks at what developers are up to have been delightful. And delight is exactly what we need right now. Anyone who’s been lucid through 2017 knows how depressing Standard Reality has become. And blowing an insane amount of money on a life-optimizing gadget is a well-known way to make yourself feel better. In theory, with AR we’ll finally be able to visualize exactly why. Lest you think I’m not eyeing this new iPhone’s potential price premium critically enough, there’s one great reason Apple’s next-gen mobile won’t be worth its cost. When I told my wife how much money I was squirreling away for this purchase, she replied, “That’s wrong.” And you know what? She’s right. $1,000 is a lot of money for a computer these days, let alone a phone. In real world terms, the new iPhone will cost the equivalent of seven weeks of groceries for my family, a half month of daycare for my kids, four months of minivan payments for the missus, or nearly 12 seasons of the Red Sox on MLB.TV. Try as I may, it’s hard to argue with those numbers. So, I won’t argue — I’ll buy. Besides, if price isn’t a question and the rumored features are in the ballpark, all that’s left to wonder is what Apple’s planning to call its new flagship handset. iPhone 8? iPhone X? iPhone Pro? iPhone Edition? They’re all in the running. Considering the cost, I’m partial to a little truth-in-adverstising, say “iPhone Grand.” But since Apple’s marketing wizards are probably going to bury the lead, and given how scarce availability may turn out to be, I’ll be happy just to call it “mine.” John Patrick Pullen has written about smart devices and home automation for TIME and Fortune since 2009.

Pristine erasers in a package of unused pencils. The rubbery smell of new sneakers still in the box. Some sensations are powerful enough to span generations—unmistakable signals that it’s back-to-school time. Others, meanwhile, are more likely to betray a person’s age group. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably told your kids about making schoolbook covers out of paper grocery bags. Today’s students have no such concerns, of course. What they toss in their book bags is made of Chrome—Google Chrome, that is. For the past several years, Google’s low-cost, high-utility Chromebooks have been the dominant computers in American schools. Effectively a browser in a no-frills box, the machines can cost as little as $150, yet perform the same functions (web browsing, email, word processing) a computer 10 times as expensive can. Right now, your kids (or their school) may be asking you to buy them one. And if you grew up visiting the library to use Print Shop, you’re probably wondering why they aren’t requesting a “real” computer, instead. From parents’ perspectives, it’s an understandable question. Millennials were the first generation to grow up with computers from birth, pushed by their parents to master complex software so they could have marketable job skills. Now they’re in those jobs and raising families of their own, wondering why their kids are getting the opposite advice. It’s not that Mom and Dad were wrong, but their way of thinking no longer applies—or at least that’s what Google thinks. “The way people think about things like productivity is very different among groups of students than it is for people like you and I,” says Rajen Sheth, a senior director of product management for Chrome. Sheth recalls including his Microsoft Word skills on his first-ever resume. But these days, the iconic word processor is listed by none of the job-seekers whose resumes hit his inbox. “It’s expected that people know computers—they grow up with them,” he says. “The computer is almost as pervasive as electricity. If you think about that, it’s a very, very different world.” If you’re a tech enthusiast like me, you’re probably as comfortable driving a Mac as a Windows PC. And if you’re not (an ambidextrous computer geek), you’ve likely settled in with one or the other. Either way, it’s unlikely you’re using a Chrome OS machine. But younger consumers seem to be gravitating toward Google. Sheth says 70 million students are currently using Chrome OS. That’s an impressive number for an operating system barely six years old. If Chrome users were a country, they’d be the U.K., plus the Republic of Ireland to round things out. (I say this with apologies to history.) No surprise, the first Chrome convert I met was a student. My barber, who was going back to school to become a mortician, needed an affordable computer, so she gambled on a Toshiba running Chrome. She says it was a drag at first because a lot of her coursework wasn’t suited for Google’s suite of built-in software. But after giving it time and acclimating to its quirks, she had no complaints. Since she graduated and started working in a morgue, the only difference she sees—between what she spent, and a more expensive Windows or Mac laptop—is the money left in her pocket. This might sound like a fringe case, but according to Robert Half International, it’s the norm. Last year, Robert Half placed about 215,000 temporary professionals across a range of industries, including technology, accounting, administrative, financial, legal and creative. In a quick survey of the company’s brain trust, none had any qualms about Chrome. According to John Reed, the company’s senior executive director of technology, employers don’t care about specific software or platforms. They just want potential hires to be tech savvy. “If you don’t have it, that’s not going to keep us from hiring someone who can add value to the organization,” he says. The only exception, of course, is if you’re a software developer in an area with specific computing requirements, he adds. I’ve been using a Chromebook Pixel this past year, and enjoy its barebones, browser-based simplicity. While my Mac is still my daily ride, the Chromebook is like the motorcycle I take to work when traffic is nuts. Most of the software I work with, like Microsoft Office, works in a browser, while other apps like Slack have Chrome-compatible versions. The Pixel offers a chance to jettison all the extras cluttering my desktop computer. Sometimes that sense of liberation helps me get more work done. I admit my biases as a writer are showing. I only have to push a cursor around, after all. My job doesn’t require professional resource-drowning tools like Adobe PhotoShop or Final Cut Pro, which don’t run in a browser. “I will fully acknowledge, there is a gap there,” says Sheth, who adds the divide is most pronounced for Windows-based business users. Google offers a few ways around these hangups. The first is through online virtualization providers that run Chrome-incompatible Windows apps on servers for companies whose workers can log in and use the software remotely. It’s like streaming video to a browser, only in this case you’re streaming the user interface to a remote computer that’s doing all the heavy lifting for whatever application you need to run. The second way involves Google’s Android apps. This month Google made its more than 1 million apps compatible with Chrome. Not every Chrome OS machine can run Android apps yet, but I’ve taken them for a spin on my Pixel, and having access to the sprawling Android-verse adds enormous versatility to the system. I know, all this talk of compatibility and virtualization makes Chrome OS sound convoluted, but in practice it’s the opposite. Chrome’s appeal boils down to this: If you can use a web browser, you can use a computer. Not having to worry about legacy busywork, say how to zip up files or create PDFs, can free you to focus on more meaningful work. And isn’t that what we all want for our children? For all the chatter we hear about the skills gap, platforms like Chrome can narrow the divide by eliminating the mundanity of computing, instead of pushing students ever further, faster and harder. No more will we train future workers on achieving inbox zero or mastering billable hours. Instead, they can focus on core abilities like communication, problem solving and creativity. Refined platforms like Chrome can clear away these hurdles, and free young minds to run. Just imagine: a life that feels like it’s in perpetual recess. You’d never have to say goodbye to the feeling of summer again. John Patrick Pullen has written about smart devices and home automation for TIME and Fortune since 2009.

CEO Tim Cook revealed how much the various models will cost, ranging from $349 to $17,000, what the device’s various apps can do, and when it will be available for purchase (April 24). One of several surprises was a slight price difference in the two planned body sizes of the Watch, which will come in 38-millimeter and 42-millimeter variants. After last year’s unveiling, many onlookers assumed the two versions were more or less women’s and men’s editions and would likely be priced according the material they’re made of and the accessories they come with. Instead, an entry-level 38-millimeter Apple Watch Sport costs $349 compared to $399 for the 42-millimeter version, for example. The difference is negligible, but might become a deciding factor for some consumers. Apple will accept pre-orders for the device starting April 10 and said it would schedule in-store fittings to help customers decide which watch suits them best. This is going to be the best way to find the right device. The company is also providing life-size version in its Apple Store app for iOS devices.

We Rounded Up the Possible Names", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "September 5, 2017 3:16 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4927440/iphone-8-edition-names/", "text": "While Apple has kept understandably quiet about its next iPhones, incessant leaks have painted a picture of what we can expect: a new design with an OLED screen that dominates the phone’s front, a 3D sensor for facial recognition and the removal of the home button are all part of Apple’s next major iPhone, according to multiple reports. But one piece of information that’s been less consistently bandied by rumormongers is what, precisely, Apple plans to call its next-gen smartphones. On September 12, the company is widely expected to debut three new iPhones: a 10-year anniversary edition iPhone that will incorporate the changes mentioned above, and two new models that update the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models. Here’s what we know so far about what these new phones might be called. If Apple follows the naming convention it’s established in recent years, updated versions of Apple’s current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be called the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Since the iPhone 4s launched in 2011, Apple has tick-tocked between giving its new smartphones a name with a single whole number and a name with the letter “s” tagged on every other year. These “s” generation iPhones typically include new technologies while maintaining the same form factor as their predecessors: the iPhone 4s looked just like the iPhone 4 but introduced Siri, for instance. Similarly, the iPhone 5s was the same size and shape as the iPhone 5, but was the first to have Touch ID. As this is a “tock” year, rumors suggest these new iPhones will run on the same processor as Apple’s 10th anniversary edition iPhone, but it’s unclear if they’ll land any of the high-end model’s other bells and whistles. If Apple does release an iPhone 7s and 7s Plus next month, similar logic — calibrated for this being the iPhone’s celebratory 10th anniversary — suggests that a rumored premium model will be called the iPhone 8. This would follow from Apple’s history of revamping the iPhone’s form factor with each singular whole number generation. But a recent report from 9to5Mac suggests the rumor mill may have this one wrong. Instead of adding an ‘s’ to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus’ successors, Apple may instead call them the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, says this report, which cites insider information obtained from third-party iPhone case makers. If true, it means that Apple views these phones as sufficiently advanced to brand them as next-generational, not just iterative updates to the current models. If the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus’ successors are in fact to be an iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, where does that leave the rumored premium edition iPhone? According to the same 9to5Mac report, Apple plans to name its 10th anniversary smartphone the iPhone Edition. This isn’t the first time someone’s suggested as much: back in March, Japanese blog Macotakara reported the same. Another rumored possible name for Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone is simply iPhone X, where the “X” stands for the Roman numeral, pronounced “ten” just as when you say “OS X.” Longtime Apple analyst and Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster believes Apple will choose this name, skipping ‘9’ to ring in the iPhone’s 10th anniversary. VentureBeat’s Evan Blass, who has a steady track record reporting on unreleased smartphones, also said he’s heard iPhone X as a possible name for Apple’s high-end iPhone. Prominent Apple blogger John Gruber suspects that Apple could call the special edition iPhone the iPhone Pro or iPhone 8 Pro. If so, the title would fit with the nomenclature Apple uses for its other premium products, the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. It would thus convey the notion that the company’s 10th anniversary iPhone is more for power users rather than mainstream smartphone shoppers.

That wasn’t only true for wealthy people, either: “People from across the income spectrum benefited from buying time,” the authors wrote in their paper. <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> To better understand how money, time, and happiness relate to each other, researchers at the University of British Columbia surveyed more than 6,000 adults in the United States, Denmark, Canada, and the Netherlands. The participants answered questions about how often they spend money to buy themselves free time, how often they felt stressed about time, their demographics, and their overall life satisfaction. <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> Even after the researchers controlled for income level, the results were clear: People who spent money on time-saving purchases reported higher levels of satisfaction with their lives. “We thought the effects might only hold up for people with quite a bit of disposable income, but to our surprise, we found the same effects across the income spectrum,” said senior author and psychology professor Elizabeth Dunn in a press release. <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> In fact, among the study’s U.S. participants, researchers noticed an even stronger relationship between buying time and enjoying life among those who were less affluent, the authors wrote in their paper. (They did note, however, that their sample included relatively few people at the “lowest rungs” of the income spectrum.) <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> RELATED: 10 Household Chores You Can Outsource to Amazon <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> The researchers also conducted an experiment in which they assigned 60 adults to spend $40 on a time-saving purchase one weekend and $40 on a material purchase another weekend. As suspected, people felt happier when they bought themselves free time than when they bought new stuff. <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> “People who hire a house cleaner or pay the kid next door to mow the lawn might feel like they’re being lazy,” said lead author Ashley Whillans, now an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, in a press release. “But our results suggest that buying time has similar benefits for happiness as having more money.” <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> So why does spending money on these types of tasks make us feel good? “Our experiment provides the clearest window into this process, by demonstrating that people felt less end-of-day time pressure when they purchased time-saving services, which explained their improved mood that day,” the authors wrote in their paper. Using money to buy time may serve “as a buffer against the deleterious effects of time pressure on overall life satisfaction,” they added. <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> If this is all true, we should probably be spending more money on time-saving purchases. The researchers reference one survey of 850 millionaires, in which almost half reported spending no money outsourcing tasks they didn’t like doing. Another survey of 98 working adults revealed that only 2 percent would spend a windfall of $40 in a way that saved them time. <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> “Lots of research has shown that people benefit from buying their way into pleasant experiences, but our research suggests people should also consider buying their way out of unpleasant experiences,” said Dunn in the press release. <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> The researchers do offer one word of caution, however: “People often complain of being in a time bind not only because they are objectively busy, but also because they perceive a lack of control over their time,” they wrote in their paper. In that sense, they say, spending too much money delegating chores and daily tasks could potentially backfire—and lead to reduced well-being—by reinforcing the idea that we can’t handle everything ourselves. <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> This article originally appeared on RealSimple.com <!-- /wp:paragraph --> These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.

The confirmation of the event comes after the Wall Street Journal and others had reported Apple would hold its event on that date. In addition to a new and ostensibly reimagined flagship iPhone, Apple is expected to introduce updated versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (presumably called the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus) as well as an updated Apple TV set-top box, and a new version of its Apple Watch that may include built-in cellular support. The new iPhone, expected to be called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X, will include numerous changes that set it apart from its predecessors: an overhauled design with a larger display that cover nearly all of the phone’s face, cutting-edge OLED screen technology for a sharper and more vivid image, facial recognition and the ability to charge without being tethered by a power cable. The so-called iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are more likely to offer modest improvements without major design changes, such new processors, more memory and tweaks to other subsystems like the camera and wireless chip. The new Apple Watch, meanwhile, could offer the ability to connect to cellular networks and better battery life, while the biggest improvement coming to the new Apple TV is expected to be support for 4K video playback. Apple typically releases its new iPhones roughly a week or two after introducing them. Last year, for example, it debuted the iPhone 7 on September 7, and the gadgets hit stores on September 16. The year prior, it unveiled the iPhone 6s on September 9 and launched them in stores on September 25.

Apple first unveiled the Apple Watch late last year, but at the time, it only gave pricing for the entry-level model, pegged at $349 to start. On Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook detailed a more precise pricing structure for the Apple Watch, saying the ultra high-end Apple Watch Edition models would start at $10,000 and go upwards from there. Cook also revealed that the larger versions of each Apple Watch will cost slightly more than their smaller brethren. The $17,000 Apple Watch is by far Apple’s most expensive singular offering.

Some six months after unveiling the device, CEO Tim Cook filled in many of the blanks, such as how much various versions will cost and how long the built-in battery will last. Cook revealed more about the device’s price. The Watch, which comes in three distinct lines and various metals, is the most customizable device the company has ever sold. The entry-level Watch Sport will cost $349 and $399, depending on the size of the body, 38 millimeters or 42 millimeters. The mid-tier Watch collection will range from $549 to $1099. The top-of-the-line Watch Edition will retail for $10,000 and up. Cook said the later device will be available in limited quantities and only in certain stores. Apple will begin taking Watch pre-orders on April 10, and is planning to offer a preview program to let customers try the devices on in stores. The Apple Watch will go on sale April 24. Cook also reviewed the device’s major features, including receiving and making phone calls, reading email, making wireless payments, controlling the music on a connected iPhone, and tracking exercise. Apple’s CEO touted features that let two Apple Watch owners send each other animated messages and imprints of their heart beats. Many of those features had been presented last year. The Apple Watch will be able to run third-party apps, much like iPhones and iPads, and the firm showed off a few new examples. Kevin Lynch, the company’s vice president of technology, demonstrated a weather application powered by The Weather Channel. Another, messaging app WeChat, works on the Watch much like it does on a smartphone, allowing users to send one another text and images. Other apps included Facebook’s Instagram, ride-hailing app Uber, music app Shazam, and a ticketing system for American Airlines. Lynch said the Watch connects to a user’s iPhone over both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, meaning the phone doesn’t necessarily have to be in close range of the watch to provide data connectivity. Cook for the first time showed off the company’s Apple Watch iPhone software, which will allow users to download apps for the device and configure their wearable via their phones. He also addressed the Watch’s battery life, one of the device’s biggest unanswered questions. He said the device would last 18 hours on a single charge. Cook showed a video of former model Christy Turlington using the device. She wore the Watch during a half marathon she ran for charity in Africa. She spoke about how the device tracked her run, including distance and pace. In a departure from previous Apple presentations, Turlington then came on stage wearing the device to give a testimonial. “We want to the Apple Watch to help you prepare for your next marathon,” Cook told her.

Instead, a virtual trail of arrows beckoned — signals from the sender teasing a virtual scavenger hunt of sorts. Bishop was able to see the trail as his iPhone’s camera viewfinder surveyed the area. He followed the secret pathway to the other side of the room, just beyond the staircase, where a message that read “Good luck!” awaited him. Bishop, head of design at GIPHY, was demonstrating how the popular picture-sharing platform’s new app works. The app, called GIPHY World, will use Apple’s ARKit platform to make GIFs (a popular format for online images) appear in the real world when viewed through the phone’s camera. ARKit, which will launch with the the latest version of Apple’s iOS operating system for iPhones and iPads this fall, is a streamlined set of tools to help developers create augmented reality experiences. Augmented reality or AR is a general way of describing software that utilizes your phone’s camera to create the illusion that objects or even fantastical creatures are secretly at arm’s length, capable of interacting with actual objects or space around you. It’s how mobile sensation Pokémon Go can make virtual monsters appear on sidewalks or in backyards, and why Snapchat can lay funky masks over your selfies. But developers and tech firms have struggled thus far to make the technology broadly appealing to audiences outside the occasional mania over a popular app. That’s why the launch of ARKit is being closely watched as a make-or-break moment. With Apple‘s backing and an instant landing path to millions of iPhones and iPads worldwide, AR is poised to finally breakout. Apple CEO Tim Cook believes augmented reality will change how we interact with technology, telling The Independent in February “I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone.” As apps built on ARKit launch alongside iOS 11 in the coming weeks, that claim will be under the microscope. Developers have had access to ARKit for several weeks, and in that time dozens of demos have surfaced. Furniture megastore IKEA, for example, plans to release a new augmented reality app called “IKEA Place” that lets you drop virtual furniture into a home. The app’s user interface is unlike that of a typical retail app, employing a camera viewer similar to Snapchat’s that tracks where you’re moving through a room so that it can accurately position furniture. IKEA’s been experimenting with augmented reality since 2013, but during my demo of its new app, I could already see ways in which it’s become more complex. Instead of placing a static sofa against a wall, the new app lets you see how that couch looks when it unfolds into a bed. And you can examine the furniture from any angle, even if you momentarily turn your camera away from the scene. Apple’s push with ARKit is already attracting some developers that would never have tried augmented reality otherwise. Asher Vollmer, creator of the popular puzzle game Threes, is also developing an app that lets users digitally furnish a room. Vollmer posted a video clip of the tech online, which shows 3D chairs, sofas, tables and fireplaces with lifelike proportions being manipulated around an empty room. He plans to expand the demo into a full app and is talking to furniture companies, he told TIME. Much of Vollmer’s background is in developing mobile games, but he says he’d consider building other augmented reality apps with ARKit. “Now I’m really invested in this world,” he says. “It’s still very early so we’ll see.” One of the biggest challenges for developers has been figuring out how to design genuinely useful AR apps, not just gimmicks masquerading as novelties. That’s why Laan Labs, the group behind Face Swap Live, has been using the Internet as a testbed to incubate ideas. A company demo video showing how ARKit can turn an iPhone into a virtual tape measurer, popularized on YouTube by Twitter account MadeWithARKit, was by far its most viewed, says Jason Laan, a partner at Laan Labs. The company is working on an ARKit-powered app that makes it possible to measure anything — from a piece of furniture’s dimensions to the diagonal length of a picture hanging on a wall — just by waving your iPhone’s camera over it. Although Laan Labs has developed at least 10 different concepts based on ARKit, with use cases including creating digital drawings and pointing a camera at a food item to discover food recipes (i.e. an avocado may become avocado toast), the firm is only expanding the tape measure demo into a full app at the moment. “It’s always hard determining what the most successful application of a technology is going to be,” says Laan. Given augmented reality’s implicit playfulness, a natural area for the tech to flourish has been video games. Game maker Climax Studios plans to launch a 3D puzzler called Arise, which projects a lush, floating mass of land filled with ruins. The player’s job is to make sure a heroic character is able to explore the area by connecting gaps in the stage. To do so, you move your iPhone or iPad around until the half-circles marked on the map align, a task that requires examining the landscape from all angles. And studio Next Games is working with entertainment giant AMC on The Walking Dead: Our World, an augmented reality vamp on the post-apocalyptic zombie TV show that turns your environment terrifyingly hostile. During my demo, a life-sized enemy crawled out of a sewer cover virtually overlaying the floor a few steps away. And when fan-favorite character Michonne appeared, her features were detailed and convincing — she even blinks as you approach her. Apple is hardly the only company providing tools to help developers build augmented reality apps. Alternatives like EasyAR, Wikitude and Kudan have existed for years. But developers say Apple’s solution makes it easier to create convincing experiences, since its tools are a part of the iPhone’s core operating system. Since ARKit is built into iOS, apps run more smoothly because there isn’t an added layer of image processing, says Barry O’Neill, the CEO of Touch Press. His company is building an augmented reality app based on Eric Carle’s renowned children’s book The Very Hungry Caterpillar. A crucial issue that ARKit solves, according to O’Neill, is keeping virtual objects firmly planted in place so that they don’t float askew. “Those things help the suspension of disbelief,” he says. “Which is a very important part of the augmented reality experience.” This was indeed true upon trying the app: when the tiny red caterpillar inched toward O’Neill in the demo, it appeared to be actually traveling across the carpet. As I moved closer to the caterpillar, I noticed the lighting on its face changed as my shadow moved — another ARKit touch that makes these creations much more realistic. Apple wasn’t the first and certainly won’t be the last major technology firm to place its bets on augmented reality. Google has been encouraging device makers and app creators to think about how AR should work on smartphones since 2014, when it unveiled its Tango depth-sensing system for mobile phones. On August 29, Google also announced its own alternative to ARKit called ARCore, a software development kit meant to help developers scale their AR apps to all Android phones, including ones that don’t support Tango. And between its HoloLens headset and the “mixed reality” viewers it’s worked on with its PC partners, it’s clear that Microsoft also sees a substantial future in augmented reality. But smartphone-based augmented reality is ground zero given how intrinsic they’ve become to our lives, and in that sense, both Apple and Google have obvious advantages. It’s on the one hand easier for developers to create apps that work across most iPhones, since there are far fewer iPhone variants than the comparable galaxy’s worth of Android ones. “It’s not an issue of reach, it’s an issue of vertical integration,” says Tuong Nguyen, a principal research analyst covering consumer technologies at Gartner. “[ARKit] was built-in house and is optimized for [Apple’s] hardware.” On the flip side, Android phones that support Tango are equipped with better hardware for providing AR experiences. Two Tango-enabled phones, the Asus Zenfone AR and Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, include depth-sensing hardware that makes it possible to map a space in three dimensions — the iPhone includes no such components, and relies on its standard camera for AR. It’s impossible to predict whether Apple or Google will dominate this still-nascent technology until more people start using it. The apps I took for a spin were demonstrated under ideal circumstances, with appropriate spacing and good lighting, and it’s unclear how they’ll work in less optimal settings. One thing is certain: a boatload of apps that use the iPhone’s camera to conjure new worlds inside the real one are about to hit the App Store. “Because it’s Apple, [ARKit] gets a critical mass of developers excited,” says Nguyen. “And that’s important because they’re the ones who are innovating.” ARKit’s success will depend on what developers manage to do with it, in other words. If these early apps are any indication, the results are sure to be fascinating.

Called AR for short, the emerging technology overlays virtual elements on the real world. It’s potentially useful for everything from medicine to gaming. “It’s a big idea like the smartphone,” Cook told The Independent last February. “I get excited because of the things that can be done that can improve a lot of lives.” Roughly four months later, we finally have an idea of Apple’s take on AR tech. During its annual WWDC event on Monday, the Cupertino, Calif. tech giant unveiled new AR tools for software developers called ARKit, marking Apple’s first public commitment toward the tech. During a demonstration of ARKit, Apple executive Craig Federighi virtually placed and manipulated digital objects like a lamp and coffee cup on the real-world table in front of him using an iPhone. Another demo showed a sci-fi movie-like experience, with alien ships raiding an outpost. The demos may have appeared crude, but Apple is hoping that developers will take ARKit and create more useful or awe-inspiring experiences. With ARKit, Apple joins the ranks of rivals like Microsoft, Facebook, and Google, all of which have also been pushing into augmented reality. Microsoft’s HoloLens headset adds digital graphics to a user’s real-world surroundings. Facebook sees AR as a potentially huge new communications platform. And Google has been experimenting in AR with products like Google Glass and its Tango platform for smartphones, which uses depth sensing to map environments. Despite all this excitement amongst the Silicon Valley crowd, AR is still unfamiliar to many people. But you’ve probably experienced it by way of Snapchat, which uses AR to modify selfies with silly masks and effects, or Pokémon Go, which uses AR to show digital creatures in the real world. But it’s not just fun and games. The companies investing in AR believe it could fundamentally change how we interact with computers. “Augmented reality is the next stage,” says Tuong Nguyen, a principal research analyst at Gartner. “It’s not going to replace what’s around, [but] AR is the next user interface step.” AR could help us harness massive computing power away from our laptops or phones, potentially unleashing a trove of possibilities. Medical device company Scopis, for instance, is experimenting with the HoloLens headset as a means of improving surgeons’ accuracy. NASA, meanwhile, is using the headset aboard the International Space Station to help astronauts conduct experiments. And employees at agricultural equipment manufacturer AGCO have been using Google Glass to assist in assembling components like tractor engines. As ambitious as these projects may be, their impacts are limited to those working in specialized fields, and could take years to become widely adopted. Most people will have their first interaction with AR through their smartphone, not a special headset. For instance, rather than turning to YouTube for an instructional video on how to assemble a piece of furniture or change a printer cartridge, you might just point your phone at an object to pull up a user manual. “If you think of it in the very long run, I think we’ll come to see it as natural that we just point our gadget to something and are able to extract a lot of insight,” says Frank Gillett, a vice president and principal analyst at research firm Forrester. Read more: The iPhone’s Best New Feature Does Nothing at All Apple may be late to the AR battleground. But it’s rarely the first one to a fight, and its presence suggests that this is a full-scale war, not a mere skirmish. The iPhone company has at least one big advantage over its rivals, too: Complete control over its hardware and software. “Because this stuff is really computationally intensive and deeply integrated, it’s probably going to work best for companies that control the operating system as well,” says Gillett. It may be a while before people start pointing their phone at a table to pull up a virtual game board. But Apple’s involvement in this still-emerging technology can help push the whole industry forward. Just look at what the iPod did for MP3 players, or what the iPad did for tablets. “For [Apple], it’s not so much about tech leadership,” says Nguyen. “It’s telling people when the technology is ready and how to use it.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4806152/apple-wwdc-keynote-ios-11-homepod/", "http://time.com/4806296/apple-iphone-distracted-driving/"], "sentiment_score": 0.11482404692082113, "subjectivity_score": 0.4065525066331516},

Here are TIME’s picks for the smartest ways to get the most out of an old Apple smartphone. You can use your iPhone as a dedicated music player either by streaming songs from a service like Spotify when connected to Wi-Fi, or by downloading tunes straight to the device. This can be handy in any number of scenarios, especially if you want to listen to music without draining your primary phone’s battery, say during a lengthy commute. You don’t need to buy an Amazon Echo or Google Home to retrieve information without reaching for your phone. You can keep your old iPhone mounted in the kitchen, either on a wall or propped up on a shelf, and use the iPhone’s “Hey Siri” feature to summon Apple’s voice-enabled helper hands-free. This can be useful for searching for recipes, setting timers and reminders, or simply answering phone calls when your hands are slathered in cookie dough. To make sure “Hey Siri” is turned on, open the iPhone’s Settings menu, tap Siri, and select Allow “Hey Siri.” If you have an iPhone 6s or higher, Siri will respond to your requests anytime. But older models must be plugged into power in order for this feature to work. The next time your remote control runs out of batteries or gets buried between the couch cushions, reach for your old iPhone instead. Cable providers such as Optimum, Spectrum and Verizon offer apps for the iPhone that make it possible to use the device as a remote control. If you have an Apple TV, you can also use your iPhone as a secondary remote by installing the Apple TV remote app. And with everyday appliances getting smarter, consider the ways even an older iPhone can interface with devices that aren’t your TV. Try mounting an old iPhone to your living room wall, for instance, to turn it into a central smart home switch, capable of controlling gadgets like Nest’s Learning Thermostat or Philips Hue wireless light bulbs.

Turn your old iPhone into a kid-friendly handheld gaming device by downloading age-appropriate apps and games. You can prevent kids from Googling unsuitable topics or spending money on apps by setting restrictions on specific apps and services. To do so, open the iPhone’s Settings menu, tap the General button, select Restrictions and tweak away. Not a joke: the iPhone supports apps designed to entertain your cat or dog. Among the most popular is Cat Fishing 2 by Nestle Purina, a game that beckons cats to chase colorful virtual fish as they swim across the screen. If your cat prefers stalking mice, try the Mouse Hunt app instead, which similarly taunts cats with digital rodents who lure them into a chase. The appropriately-named Games for Dogs app, meanwhile, teases pups with virtual chew toys. If you’re constantly running out of storage on your current iPhone or just need a device for taking files with you on the go, turn your old iPhone into a portable USB drive. Use an app like File Manager to browse and organize documents and share them between your iPhone and laptop or desktop.

Apps such as Manything and Presence allow you to view a live feed of content being recorded via your old iPhone on your new device. Both apps can also send an alert when motion is detected, but require users to pay in order to unlock more premium features. These apps can be very helpful for those who just want basic surveillance, though you’ll want a dedicated security cameras if you need more advanced hardware-based functionality, like night vision. Your iPhone is a phone above all else, and it’s perfectly capable of functioning as a communication device without a SIM card. Major carriers in the U.S. including Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T support Wi-Fi calling, which can be enabled by launching your iPhone’s Settings menu, tapping the Phone option, and turning it on. Apps such as Skype, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp also allow users to make calls without a data plan. If you want to document your next hike or beach trip but worry about damaging your brand new iPhone, use your old one as a spare photo-grabber. The nearly two generations old iPhone 6s, with its 12-megapixel camera and Live Photos feature, is still as good as most point-and-shoot cameras. And if you’re truly worried about image quality, try using an editing app like PicsArt or Snapseed to clean up your photos after shooting.

Not just a digital version on undifferentiated glass, but no go-to screen point whatsoever? If Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman proves correct, that may be where Apple’s next iPhone is headed when the company unveils its 10th anniversary edition iPhone on September 12. The iPhone’s home button serves several purposes, from summoning Siri to unlocking the device and authenticating Apple Pay purchases. But Apple may ditch the home button in favor of incorporating new software-based gestures for interacting with the device, according to the report. Gurman claims Apple is testing a high-end version of the iPhone with no home button at all — not even a digital one. Instead, a software bar would display across the bottom of the screen. Users could flick up toward the middle of the display to unlock the iPhone, then switch between an app and the home screen. Gurman attributes the changes to images he’s viewed of the new device that he says have been verified by people familiar with the gadget. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard claims about Apple adding new gestures to the iPhone. Earlier this month, developer Guilherme Rambo discovered videos hidden in Apple’s iOS 11 beta that show how swiping up from the bottom of the screen could launch the phone’s app switcher. Currently, users switch between apps by double-pressing the home button. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment. The removal of the home button would provide more space for the larger screen Apple is expected to debut on its forthcoming premium iPhone. The 10th anniversary version of the device will feature a taller screen with rounded corners and a cutout at the top for the selfie camera and facial recognition sensors, says Bloomberg. The new phone will reportedly be about the same size as the iPhone 7, but will have a screen that’s larger than the iPhone 7 Plus’ 5.5-inch display. The changes would come long after Android phone makers have released new smartphones with similar features. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S8 devices both include a screen with super slim borders above and below the display, while the screen’s glass slightly curves over the edges. The new Essential Phone (from Android co-creator Andy Rubin) also has a barely present frame around the screen, with a small cutout at the top for its camera. Apple’s new phone won’t have a curved screen, according to Bloomberg, conflicting with previous reports, but Gurman does describe it as being “almost all screen.” Apple is expected to unveil this new high-end iPhone along with updated versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, a refreshed Apple TV and a new Apple Watch on September 12.

While the nuances of the housing market and the life choices of millennials may be fodder for endless debate, new data from Square makes one thing clear: the avocado toast business is booming. Square, a tech company that helps businesses process credit card payments, crunched data from sellers around the U.S. and found that Americans are spending nearly $900,000 per month on crusty bread topped with mashed green fruit. That’s a huge increase from what the company was seeing in 2014, when Square’s sellers were only moving $17,000 worth of avocado toast per month. Though that’s a drop in the urn compared to the amount people spend on coffee, for instance, the hard figure for how much Americans are spending on such toast is certainly much larger, given that the Square data does not include the many avocado-toast-offering restaurants and food trucks and fast-casual counters that are not using Square’s services. And the jump remains proof of how hot the commodity has become. The company says the increase in sales has far outpaced Square’s growth in sellers. So what of millionaire Tim Gurner’s claim that millennials are spending $19 a pop for this green-and-creamy brunch fave? Based on data from hundreds of Square sellers, the company found the average cost to be $6.78, with the cheapest avocado toast going for $2 and the most expensive going for $18. Given that the Australian dollar is weaker than the U.S. dollar ($19 Australian = about $15 U.S.), Gurner was within Square’s range. The average price was highest in Los Angeles, at $8.50 a pop, and lowest in D.C., at a mere $4. Avocado toast consumption levels in U.S. cities vary, as do creative local spins on the item, which Square sellers are hawking in varieties like grilled cheese avocado toast and avocado toast lobster rolls. Per Square, the highest consumption per capita is (predictably) in San Francisco, followed by Honolulu, Nashville and Portland, Ore. Long before smashed avocados were raising haunches, the City by the Bay was grappling with another great debate over the price of browned bread. Tensions over inequality have risen in San Francisco in recent years, and in 2014 stakeholders zeroed in on the fact that people were purchasing $4 toast as evidence that one-percenters were fueling an affordability crisis. Back then, the small business offering the $4 toast had options like whole-wheat-sesame-poppy bread with butter. These days, millennials can get an “avocado mash” on toast at the same spot for twice the price. But, as many pointed out in the wake of Gurner’s comment, it would take a lot of toast to make a real difference in one’s housing situation. In fact, a person would have to save the equivalent of 475 of those mashes just to afford one month’s rent on the average San Francisco apartment.

The keynote, set to occur on September 12 at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s new “spaceship” campus, is expected to be packed with announcements ranging from a new 10th anniversary edition iPhone to an updated Apple Watch, Apple TV and more. Apple’s next-gen smartphone’s form and specs will undoubtedly be the headliner: it’s expected to change in nearly every way, from its physical design to the size and quality of its screen and the sensors within. Here’s a closer look at the hardware we’re expecting to see in Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone — which could be called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X — based on the most recent supply chain rumors. Apple never (as in never, ever) discusses its future products ahead of unveilings, but historically it’s always outfitted new phones with updated processors. It’s thus going out on no limbs to say the iPhone 8 will be powered by a next-gen chipset, probably dubbed “Apple A11” if the company keeps to current naming conventions. (The current iPhone 7 models are powered by the Apple A10.) This new “system on a chip” processor is expected to have a more efficient 10-nanometer architecture (smaller than the A10’s 16-nanometer one), according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Apple is also widely rumored to be launching updated ‘s’ versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that will adopt this processor. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s Plus are both expected to include 3GB of higher speed RAM, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, while the iPhone 7s would have 2GB of memory. Here’s one iPhone 8 rumor that’s persisted for months: Apple will use an OLED, or Organic Light Emitting Diode display, rather than an LCD panel for its new smartphone. These types of displays, which are already common in phones made by Samsung and others, generally offer notably better contrast and deeper blacks than LCD screens, producing much more vibrant imagery. This screen will be larger than that of the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, says Bloomberg, although the report doesn’t specify by exactly how much. KGI Securities’ Kuo predicts that Apple will use a 5.8-inch panel for the iPhone 8, but that some of the screen space will be used for virtual buttons, as MacRumors notes. Multiple reports have surmised the new iPhone will include a 3D sensor for facial recognition, which could allow users to unlock an iPhone simply by looking at it. In a note from earlier this year, KGI Securities’ Kuo detailed what he predicts that sensor might entail, calling it a “revolutionary” front-facing camera system according to MacRumors. The selfie camera would include three main components based on Kuo’s research: an infrared transmitting module, an infrared receiving module and the same front camera as in Apple’s current iPhones. These modules would make it possible for the front-facing camera to sense depth, using algorithms from PrimeSense, the Israeli company Apple acquired in 2013. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang points to California-based Viavi Solutions as a potential supplier for Apple’s 3D-sensing sensors, according to a report from Barron’s. Read more: iPhone 8 Release Date: Everything We Know So Far Apple’s new iPhones will let you pick from three colors, including a black, silver and gold option, says KGI Securities’ Kuo. YouTuber Danny Winget claims to have received mockup units showing what the iPhone 8’s color choices will look like, as 9to5Mac notes. In his video below, he shows three different colors: black, white and a third that looks almost like Apple’s current Rose Gold option. Apple hasn’t fully redesigned its iPhone since it released the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, but that’s likely to change on September 12. The company’s 10th anniversary iPhone is expected to be radically different, with an edge-to-edge screen that includes a notch at the top for the selfie camera, according to Bloomberg. Other physical changes could include rounded edges for the screen, as well as a glass back with stainless steel edges that somewhat resemble the much older iPhone 4 and 4s. Apple is expected to make some changes to the way you charge an iPhone this fall, most conspicuously the addition of support for wireless charging, though that’s a feature Android phones have long supported. But the new iPhones may charge at a slower rate than some competitors over wireless, according to a report from Macotakara. It’s worth noting that Apple joined the Wireless Power Consortium earlier this year, an organization that develops industry standards, which could be a signal that wireless charging is indeed in store for future iPhones. Separately, KGI Securities’ Kuo predicts that all new iPhone models will come with support for USB-C power delivery through the Lightning connector, which should enable quicker charging when plugged in. Given Apple’s recent focus on augmented reality, it’s no surprise to hear chatter that the new iPhone may come with a new camera setup to better enable such experiences. The new device will include two rear cameras, like Apple’s current smartphones, but they’ll be situated one atop the other rather than side-by-side, according to Bloomberg. This should position the camera system to work better with augmented reality apps, says the report. Code buried in Apple’s HomePod firmware, which developer Guilherme Rambo discovered, also points to a new Smart Camera feature for the next iPhone. This capability would enable the iPhone to recognize specific scenes and objects, such as babies, fireworks, a bright stage and snow, among other scenarios. Those who miss the 64GB storage option Apple previously offered may be in luck. The iPhone 8 is expected to be available in 64GB and 256GB storage capacities, as both KGI Securities’ Kuo and Chinese social media account GeekBar have noticed. The latter, however, also claims Apple could launch a new 512GB option, which would be a first for iPhones.

He did it as follows: Portnoy had a friend call one of the dorms, posing as tech support. The students were more than happy to give him their passwords. Hiding behind those borrowed accounts and routing his approach through proxies in various foreign countries, Portnoy wormed his way into the school’s network through a bug in the system that’s technically known as a vulnerability, or even more technically as a zero-day. “I had access to every email, grades, everything,” he says. “They had a number of issues with their configurations that allowed me to just kind of spread everywhere.” Showing what in retrospect seems like considerable restraint, Portnoy tweaked the school’s website to say something uncomplimentary about another student. Then he got out. Later the school brought in tech experts to trace the intrusion, but they could never quite track it back to him. So naturally Portnoy did it again the next year and got caught. The academy encouraged him to find an alternative venue for his education. It didn’t really matter. He graduated from a local high school instead and went on to Northeastern University. It was all excellent preparation for what he does for a living now: researching and selling software vulnerabilities, which since his high school days have become one of the world’s newer and more controversial commodities. Portnoy, now 28, is the co-founder of a two-year-old company in Austin called Exodus Intelligence. Its mission statement reads, “Our goal is to provide clients with actionable information, capabilities, and context for our exclusive zero-day vulnerabilities.” Which means–translated from the quasi-paramilitary parlance that’s endemic to the software-security industry–that Exodus Intelligence finds and sells bugs, specifically the kind of bugs that could potentially give a third party access to a computer, the same way Portnoy got access to his high school’s network. They’re worth a lot of money. Vulnerabilities in popular applications and operating systems have been known to change hands for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. They’re worth a lot because although you wouldn’t know to look at it, the Internet is a war zone. Even as it gets outwardly ever glossier and more social and eager to please, below that surface the Net is becoming a hostile, contested territory where private companies, law enforcement, criminals, the military and various international intelligence agencies are engaged in constant low-level cyberwarfare. This conflict only occasionally becomes visible to the naked eye–in May, for example, when the U.S. indicted five members of the Chinese army for stealing data from American companies, including Westinghouse and Alcoa. That wasn’t an anomaly; it’s the norm, and it’s getting more normal all the time. Retired Army general Keith Alexander, who formerly headed both the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, has called China’s ongoing electronic theft of American intellectual property “the greatest transfer of wealth in history.” Two weeks ago several security firms confirmed that a group believed to be backed by the Russian government has been systematically hacking the U.S.’s energy infrastructure since at least 2012. According to IBM’s security division, the average American company fielded a total of 16,856 attacks in 2013. Cyberwar isn’t the future; it’s already here. It’s business as usual. In this war, the battlefield is everywhere, bugs are weapons, and people like Portnoy are arms dealers. The idea that a software bug can be worth actual dollars and cents is an odd one. Bugs are mistakes; people generally pay money to fix them. The fact that there’s a market for them is a consequence of the larger oddness of our present technological era, in which our entire world–our businesses, medical records, social lives, governments–is emigrating bit by bit out of physical reality and into the software-lined innards of computers in the form of data. A lot of people are interested in that data, for reasons both good and bad. Some of those people are spies. Some of them are criminals. Bugs are what they use to get at it. In 2009 there was a good object lesson in what makes vulnerabilities so useful. The U.S. and Israel had jointly developed a complex computer worm that was designed to penetrate and compromise a specific uranium-enrichment facility in the Iranian city of Natanz. The worm, which is now known as Stuxnet, was arguably the first true cyberweapon. It was introduced into the facility’s computer system by a double agent with a USB drive. The worm checked out the place and sent detailed intelligence back to its masters. Then it really let down its hair and went after the computers that controlled the centrifuges used to enrich the uranium. It eventually destroyed about 20% of them. (All this has been deduced after the fact by security experts and journalists, since both the U.S. and Israeli governments are still mum on the subject.) What made Stuxnet so effective? In a word: bugs. To get the access it needed, Stuxnet took advantage of at least four distinct vulnerabilities, including one in Microsoft Windows. These vulnerabilities–or rather, the knowledge needed to exploit them–were themselves not unlike the enriched uranium the Iranians were working on, but in software form: expensive, highly refined munitions that formed the core of an extremely sophisticated weapons system. They made Stuxnet all the more destructive when–unsurprisingly to anyone who’s seen Jurassic Park–it got loose from the Natanz facility and infected around 100,000 computers worldwide. The idea of paying money for bugs goes back a lot further than Stuxnet. In 1995 Netscape announced a “Bugs Bounty” program that paid cash to anybody who could find flaws in its browser. The company wasn’t trying to destroy centrifuges; it just wanted to fix holes in its software. In 2002 a security firm called iDefense started buying up vulnerabilities of all kinds; another company, TippingPoint, launched a similar program in 2005. Both programs were created as alternatives to the increasingly active and chaotic exchange of zero-days on the open market–essentially they acted as safe zero-day disposal facilities, a bit like radioactive-waste repositories. If you found a bug, instead of selling it to the highest bidder, who would do God knows what with it, you could sell it to iDefense or TippingPoint for a reliable price, and they would alert their clients to the problem and work with the software vendor to get the bug patched. iDefense and TippingPoint had something else in common too: they both, in successive years, 2005 and 2006, hired an intern named Aaron Portnoy. Portnoy in no way resembles Matthew Broderick in WarGames. He’s a confident, affable, articulate guy who makes good eye contact and just happens to be a super-cyberintrusions expert. In 2006, Portnoy dropped out of Northeastern to work at TippingPoint full time, then in 2012 he left to go into the vulnerabilities business on his own. Exodus Intelligence joined a small, elite field that includes Vupen, which is based in the south of France; Revuln in Malta; Netragard in the U.S.; and Telus in Canada. (Netragard wins for best corporate motto: “We protect you from people like us.”) Exodus’ headquarters are in an office park in Austin, which it shares with accountants and real estate agents. The place is spartan even by tech-startup standards: there’s exactly one piece of interior decoration, a pirate flag tacked up on a wall. Its nine inhabitants spend their days banging on software looking for ways in: browsers, email clients, instant-messaging clients, Flash, Java, industrial control systems, anything an attacker could use as an entry point. “One thing we try to maintain is a capability in every major backup software out there, because that’s one of the juiciest targets,” Portnoy says. “If you get on an enterprise network, what is an administrator going to want to protect? Their important information. What do they use to protect that? Backup software.” When a researcher at Exodus finds a vulnerability, he or she types it up in a professional-looking report along with technical documentation that explains what it does, where it lives, what it gets you, how to spot it, what versions of the software it works on, how one could mitigate it and so on. Most important, Exodus provides you with an exploit, which is the procedure you’d have to follow to actually trigger the bug and take advantage of it. “Every single vulnerability that we give our customers comes with a working exploit,” Portnoy says. “If we can’t exploit it, we don’t even bother telling anyone. It’s not worth it.” Voilà, one freshly minted zero-day vulnerability. (A note on that term, zero-day: it refers to a bug’s freshness. Bugs, like fish, don’t age well, and zero-day means that the bug has been public for exactly zero days, hence no one has tried to fix it yet. The term is so ubiquitous that it has gone from adjective to noun: Portnoy sells zero-days.) Portnoy takes pride in the superior quality and effectiveness of Exodus’ exploits. “We try to make them as nasty and invasive as possible,” he explains. “We tout what we deliver as indicative of or surpassing the current technical capabilities of people who are actually actively attacking others.” When a company hires Exodus, it does so on a subscription basis: you get a certain number of bugs a year for such-and-such amount of money. Subscriptions start at around $200,000. The vulnerabilities business has a mixed reputation, based on the presumption that the bugs it provides are being used for criminal or unethical purposes. A Washington, D.C., company called Endgame that sold vulnerabilities to the government for years was dubbed “the Blackwater of hacking” by Forbes magazine. Last year, when Endgame announced that it was getting out of the game, it did so triumphantly, as if it were kicking a heroin habit: “The exploit business is a crummy business to be in,” its CEO said. The reality is more complex. Exodus’ clients come in two basic types, offensive and defensive. Playing for the defense are security firms and antivirus vendors who are looking for information they can integrate into their products, or who want to keep their clients up to speed on what threats are out there. On offense are penetration testers, consultants who use Exodus’ zero-days to play the “red team” in simulated attacks on their own or other people’s networks. “If they want to show what a real attack would look like from a determined adversary,” Portnoy says, “we give them the tools to do that.” And then there are the ones who aren’t just playing. Portnoy is discreet about his client list, but others have been less so. It’s well known that the NSA and the FBI are fond of implanting surveillance software on target computers to gather intelligence; the FBI is even now lobbying the courts to make it easier to get warrants to do just that. How do you implant software on somebody’s computer without them knowing about it? One way is to exploit a vulnerability. Last year the FBI busted a company called Freedom Hosting, which it called “the largest facilitator of child porn on the planet.” Freedom Hosting operated on the Tor network, which anonymizes Web traffic. To get around the anonymity, the FBI used a vulnerability in Firefox. As for the NSA, the Washington Post’s analysis of the Edward Snowden leaks revealed an NSA budget that included $25.1 million for “additional covert purchases of software vulnerabilities,” suggesting that they both buy zero-days and roll their own internally. (In September the investigative-journalism site MuckRock obtained a copy of a contract between the NSA and Vupen, which has just opened a satellite office outside Washington.) That same budget provided a remarkable X-ray of a secret NSA initiative code-named GENIE, funded at $652 million, to implant malware on foreign computer networks on a mass scale. By the end of 2013, GENIE was expected to control around 85,000 machines. On the day I interviewed him, Portnoy was just back from a meeting at the Pentagon. “We’re dealing a lot more in the government space,” he says. “That’s been a big change. It wasn’t really something that we had taken into account with our business model, but it turns out that the government has a hard time staffing people who can do what we do.” It’s learning. According, again, to the Snowden documents, the U.S. mounted 231 offensive cyberoperations in 2011 against China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, among others–and that was 2011, ancient history in cybertime. The 2015 defense budget includes $5 billion for cyberspace operations, which is a very general term for an arena about which not much is known. Verizon estimates, in its annual Data Breach Investigations Report, that 22% of data breaches last year were attributable to cyberespionage operations. But the report also acknowledges that solid information about cyberespionage is “really hard to come by.” The action is covert, and even when you can spot it, cyberespionage is difficult to distinguish from the industrial kind, or from plain old cybercrime, because it’s so hard to pinpoint the source and intent of an attack. Given their offensive potential, you’d think the government would want to control the trade in vulnerabilities the way it does, say, the trade in fighter jets and land mines. But regulators are just now catching up with it. The Wassenaar Arrangement, which is the international agreement that governs arms sales among the U.S. and 40 other participating nations, was modified in December to include “intrusion software” in its list of restricted dual-use technologies, but so far that change hasn’t been enforced. “It’s not a market that right now the government has really looked at regulating,” a senior Administration official told TIME. “We’ve been much more in the voluntary best-practices-and-standards space. And I think that you’ll see us continue to focus on that.” Which sometimes places Portnoy and his colleagues in the odd position of having to make their own ethical choices about whom they will and won’t sell to. Portnoy stays out of politics as much as possible–“we try to distance ourselves from what our customers’ use case is,” is how he puts it–but no question, there’s a line. He won’t work with embargoed countries: North Korea, Sudan, Iran, Cuba. “We do some due diligence when we’re talking to potential customers,” he says. “We will run it through the State Department. We’ll run it through some military organizations that we have some contacts at … but there’s no currently legally binding statutes that we have to abide by. That will probably change.” Vupen takes a similar position, according to its CEO, Chaouki Bekrar, who weighed in via email: “Our unique goal and motivation is to help our government customers to fight crime and save lives using our zero-day exploits, and we have successes every week all around the world, thus all allegations and bad press about zero-day technologies is just gossip and bullsh-t.” Nevertheless, people will talk. “For media and press releases, they’re going to say, ‘Yeah, we only sell to these markets,’ but nobody has any idea,” says John Pirc, CTO of the information-security-research firm NSS Labs. “Things are under NDA. There’s no telling who they sell to.” The potential for abuse is real, anyway. Zero-days don’t care whose computer you’re accessing or why. On April 28 researchers at the security firm Kaspersky Lab disclosed the existence of a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash that could be used to install malware on a target machine, if the user of that machine could be induced to visit a certain specific website. For good measure the researchers checked out who was hosting that specific website. In this case it turned out to be the Syrian Ministry of Justice. One could reasonably theorize that the Syrian government was taking advantage of a zero-day to surveil its own dissidents. The real nightmare scenario is an attack on public infrastructure by a political group unrestrained by any national affiliation. Terrorists, for example. “Zero-day vulnerabilities, if you’re able to identify one of them, can do serious harm,” says Mary Galligan, formerly the special agent in charge of cyber and special operations in the FBI’s New York office, currently at Deloitte and Touche. As an example she mentions SCADA, which stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, the software used to control industrial systems. That’s what Stuxnet went after. “Everything that we think of–manufacturing floors, the electrical grid, or the water supply, or elevators–that are run with data equipment, it’s connected to the Internet. The real concern is, that’s the part that’s least protected.” Even if tin-pot dictators and cybercriminals can’t shop at Exodus, there’s a lively black market for vulnerabilities, although information about it is scarce. Some people consider it a serious problem; some don’t. “It would mystify me why people would do this for criminal means when you can make so much money doing it legally,” says Dave Aitel, CEO of the security firm Immunity and a former researcher for the NSA. “I’m not saying you’re going to buy a Ferrari, but you’re definitely 100% going to have a top-of-the-line Honda Civic.” But a report by the Rand Corp. published in March characterized the black market for vulnerabilities as “a playground of financially driven, highly organized and sophisticated groups.” Katie Moussouris, formerly senior security strategist lead at Microsoft and now chief policy officer for HackerOne, a startup in the vulnerability space, says black-market prices can be even higher than those in the legitimate marketplace. “I’ve seen pricing models where a six-figure payout will go out as a lump sum, and then a monthly recurring fee will be paid to the researcher to encourage them to keep quiet and not use it and not double-sell it.” Portnoy is sniffy about the quality: most of what’s on the black market doesn’t have that zero-day freshness. Criminals typically target older vulnerabilities, for which fixes have already been released, and just troll the Net till they find somebody who hasn’t updated their software yet, zero-day, shmero-day. “It’s more like, ‘It’s going to work 10% of the time, but that’s good enough for us because that gets us our payday,'” Portnoy says. But there’s good hunting out there: according to Symantec’s Internet Security Threat Report 2014, 1 in 8 websites it scanned had a serious unpatched vulnerability. “One of the things that we talk about is, How do you undermine the economics of that market?” says a senior Obama Administration official. “How do you actually get people to patch their systems much faster, how do you get it to be done automatically … so now you can’t use that same crappy piece of malware and that attack vector over and over again?” Then there’s still another market, on the other side from the black one, which is run by the people who wrote the buggy software in the first place. Big software companies are increasingly finding it cost-effective to buy up their own bugs and fix them before anybody else can exploit them–it’s kind of like doing your beta testing after you ship the product. In 2010 Google helped set the trend by offering rewards for vulnerabilities in Chrome; this year its total payouts have reached the $3.3 million mark. Now bug-bounty programs are standard practice–even Etsy has one. Microsoft will pay up to $100,000 for a serious security flaw in Windows. Last year Facebook paid out $1.5 million for a total of 687 bugs. Facebook’s program comes with its own special flourish: you get a branded White Hat Bug Bounty Visa debit card. But there’s still a noticeable gap between the prices companies will pay for vulnerabilities and the amounts those bugs will fetch on the open market. There’s an annual hacking event called Pwn2Own in which contestants compete to find flaws in popular software–Portnoy directed the first Pwn2Own in 2007. In 2012 the Vupen team beat the security on Chrome, which would have qualified them for a $60,000 prize–except they turned the money down, even when Google offered to double it. They kept the vulnerability for their clients. It’s reaching the point where software companies can’t afford their own bugs. There’s a lively debate going on in Washington over whether vulnerabilities should be kept secret at all. After the Heartbleed bug became public in April, Businessweek ran a story claiming that the NSA not only already knew about it but had even been using it to spy on people for years. The White House and the NSA deny this–the NSA even tweeted about it, so you know they’re serious–but the idea that U.S. intelligence agencies are sitting on a private arsenal of software vulnerabilities that they blithely use to penetrate other people’s computers, rather than reporting them and getting them fixed, makes a lot of people uncomfortable. But there’s a counterargument, which is that you have to strike a balance between public-spiritedly debugging the world’s software on the one hand, and defending the country on the other. “I don’t think the NSA has any obligation, if you’re talking about legal obligations, to disclose vulnerabilities,” says Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School. “The NSA has always been in the business of finding vulnerabilities in communications technology. That’s what they do.” On a more practical level, even if the NSA does give up its vulnerabilities, the Chinese and Russians won’t, which leaves us on the wrong end of a vulnerability gap. “You have a tendency to say, Let’s fix all the problems, but all that does is completely defang the NSA and leave all the power in the hands of our opponents,” Aitel argues. He thinks the NSA should hoard its zero-days at all costs. “It’s the only hope. It is the Obi-Wan of our intelligence efforts.” Current policy, per a December report by the President’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, is that the government will disclose zero-days except when they’re needed for “an urgent and significant national security priority.” A senior Administration official adds that they disclose the vulnerabilities they find “a very large percentage of the time,” more than three-quarters. “There’s this image that we have this Raiders of the Lost Ark–style warehouse full of these things someplace,” he says. “That’s just not how it works. The truth is that most of the time the interest that we have is actually on the defensive side–it’s actually getting the vulnerability to the vendor and identifying it for them, actually getting it fixed.” The dream, of course, is a world where there are no more vulnerabilities, where software can be perfected, security will be total, and we can move on and find something else to worry about. But the trend is going the other way. The more we ask computers to do for us, the more urgently we need them to be secure–but the more computers have to do, the more complex their software has to be, and therefore the more bugs they have, and round and round–it’s a vicious cycle. The operating system on your laptop consists of tens of millions of lines of code. Throw a bunch of applications on top of that, most of which have been rushed to market three-quarters finished, then connect your laptop to millions of other devices, tablets and phones included, each with its own configuration of hardware and software, and the situation rapidly becomes unmanageable. “There are a finite number of bugs in a given piece of software,” Portnoy says. “However, that given piece of software is updated and added to and changed, and underlying operating systems change, and they have to support a legacy this, that and the other thing. Windows XP–when was that released? In 2000? 2001? You have to support systems that are 15 years old. And there’s new software being released every day, and new classes of vulnerabilities being discovered. As long as that’s the case, we’ll have a job.” Patching vulnerabilities is a bit like bailing the ocean: you’re never done. Coding practices and standards are getting better, but not fast enough. The National Vulnerability Database–maybe you didn’t know we had one, but we do–currently lists 63,239 vulnerabilities; researchers found an average of 13 a day last year. In March it came out that the federal government notified 3,000 U.S. companies that they’d been hacked last year. The walls around our data don’t just have chinks in them; they’re more chink than wall. The longer you talk to people in the computer-security business, the more you realize that there is no such thing: it doesn’t exist. We’ve been so successful in building a connected paradise where information flows freely, and so eager to move our lives into it, that we’ve gotten ahead of our ability to keep information from flowing when we don’t want it to. The result is a new kind of war–yet another one, in a millennium that seems to specialize in them. It’s unobtrusive but constant and pervasive. It makes little distinction between military and civilian, private and public, politics and business. Its victims bleed personal data and intellectual property, and by the time they figure out they’ve been hit, it’s already much too late. “There are always going to be zero-days out there,” says a senior Administration official. “It’s not just about the protection, the walls and moats and the barbed-wire equivalents in cyberspace. You have to work under the assumption that some of the time the bad guys are going to get in.” –WITH REPORTING BY SAM FRIZELL/NEW YORK AND MASSIMO CALABRESI/WASHINGTON Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.10274451138087506, "subjectivity_score": 0.4277610386246753},

They recovered, among other things, 12 pipe bombs, thousands of rounds of ammunition of several different calibers, and three cell phones: two from a dumpster behind the townhouse and one from the center console of a black Lexus IS 300 parked outside. The two phones in the trash had been crushed by the terrorists, but for whatever reason–maybe an oversight, maybe there was nothing useful on it, who knows–the third phone was intact. It was placed in the care of the Orange County Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory. When investigators booted it up–it was an iPhone 5c running iOS 9, on the Verizon network, serial number FFMNQ3MTG2DJ–the phone asked them for a four-digit pass code. What followed was like a kid’s game of fortunately-unfortunately. Unfortunately, they didn’t have the pass code, and the person who did was dead. (Farook and Malik were killed in a shoot-out with police a few hours after the attack.) They could have tried to guess it, but the phone was set up to erase itself after 10 wrong guesses. Fortunately, the phone was Farook’s work phone, so technically it belonged to San Bernardino County. Unfortunately, the county didn’t have the pass code either, nor did it have the password for the iCloud account associated with the phone, which in the Apple security ecosystem is different from the phone’s pass code. But the county did have the power to reset the iCloud password, which it did. That iCloud account turned out to contain several full, unencrypted backups of the phone. Unfortunately, Farook hadn’t backed up his phone to iCloud since Oct. 19, so the data was out of date. Further misfortune: not all the information on an iPhone is necessarily included in a backup. All that data was still on the phone, but encrypted with a pass code that nobody had. Not even, amazingly, the company that made the phone: Apple. The FBI did ask. “We didn’t hear anything for a few days,” says Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO and the successor to the late Steve Jobs. “I think it was Saturday before we were contacted. We have a desk, if you will, set up to take requests from government. It’s set up 24/7–not as a result of this, it’s been going for a while–and the call came in to that desk, and they presented us with a warrant as it relates to this specific phone.” At 55, Cook is wiry and silver-haired, with an Alabama accent that he has carefully transplanted to Silicon Valley. We spoke in his office at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino–the address, famously, is 1 Infinite Loop. It’s a modest office, an askew trapezoid, almost ostentatiously unostentatious, with a few framed “Think Different” posters on the walls, some arty photographs of Apple stores and a large wooden plaque with a quote from Theodore Roosevelt on it (the “daring greatly” one). Jobs’ office is next door. It’s dark, with curtains drawn, but the nameplate is still there. MORE: The Full Transcript of TIME’s Interview With Apple CEO Tim Cook To be clear: Apple complied with, and actively assisted, the FBI’s investigation, right up until it didn’t. There was plenty of cordial back-and-forth, exchanges of information and know-how. “We gave them some unsolicited advice–we said, take the phone to the home or apartment and power it, plug it in and let it back up. And as it turned out, they came back and said, Well, that didn’t work.” It emerged that resetting the iCloud password had been a serious tactical error: they could’ve gotten the phone to make a fresh backup of itself automatically, but once you change the iCloud password, it won’t back itself up without the pass code. That’s when the FBI made a further request: O.K., Apple didn’t have the pass code, but maybe it could code up a new version of iOS 9 without the 10-guess limit (and without enforced pauses between guesses, another security measure) and then persuade the San Bernardino phone to install it? A four-digit pass code has only 10,000 possibilities. The FBI could brute-force that in a day and everybody could go home. Inside Apple this idea is nicknamed, not affectionately, GovtOS. “We had long discussions about that internally, when they asked us,” Cook says. “Lots of people were involved. It wasn’t just me sitting in a room somewhere deciding that way, it was a labored decision. We thought about all the things you would think we would think about.” The decision, when it came, was no. Cook actually thought that might be the end of it. It wasn’t: on Feb. 16 the FBI both escalated and went public, obtaining a court order from a federal judge that required Apple to create GovtOS under something called the All Writs Act. Cook took deep, Alabaman umbrage at the manner in which he learned about the court order, which was in the press: “If I’m working with you for several months on things, if I have a relationship with you, and I decide one day I’m going to sue you, I’m a country boy at the end of the day: I’m going to pick up the phone and tell you I’m going to sue you.” It also wasn’t lost on Cook that the FBI chose not to file the order under seal: if Apple wasn’t going to help with a case of domestic terrorism, the FBI wanted Apple to do it under the full glare of public opinion. The spectacle of Apple, the most admired company in the world, refusing to aid the FBI in a domestic-terrorism investigation has inflamed public passions in a way that, it’s safe to say, nothing involving encryption algorithms and the All Writs Act ever has before. Donald Trump asked, “Who do they think they are?” and called for a boycott of Apple. A Florida sheriff said he would “lock the rascal up,” the rascal meaning Cook. Even President Obama, whose relations with the technorati of Silicon Valley have historically been warm, spoke out about the issue at South by Southwest: “It’s fetishizing our phones above every other value. And that can’t be the right answer.” As against that, Apple has been smothered in amicus briefs from technology firms supporting its position, including AT&T, Airbnb, eBay, Kickstarter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Square, Twitter, Cisco, Snapchat, WhatsApp and every one of its biggest, bitterest rivals: Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, spoke out in Apple’s defense. So did retired general Michael Hayden, former head of both the NSA and the CIA. The notoriously hawkish Senator Lindsey Graham, who started out lambasting Apple, switched sides after a briefing on the matter. Steve Dowling, Apple’s vice president of communications, showed me a check for $100 that somebody sent to support the world’s most valuable technology company in its legal fight. (Apple didn’t cash it.) You can see what the fuss is about. The optics of Apple’s decision are pretty terrible, and the reasons for it aren’t obvious or simple. The main reason is technical: if Apple created what amounts to a tool for cracking open iPhones, Cook argues (and security experts tend to agree), and that tool got out into the wild, through hacking or carelessness, the security of every iPhone everywhere would be compromised. This is not an unlikely scenario: code, like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, often finds a way to get free. Under this scenario, GovtOS would be the holy grail for hackers everywhere and a gift to authoritarian governments willing and eager to pry into their citizens’ secrets. “To invent what they want me to invent,” Cook says, “puts millions of people at risk.” To be clear, Cook doesn’t mean people are at risk of having their nude selfies put online. He sees the risks of hacking as real, real enough to weigh against the nightmare of a possible terrorist attack. “It’s not that one side has life and one side is your financial information or your photo or whatever,” he says. “Think about something that happens to the infrastructure, where there’s a power-grid issue. Think about the people who are on a medical device that depends on electricity … these aren’t fantasy things by any means.” (He also doesn’t think that GovtOS would help the FBI much anyway, but more on that later.) The FBI has argued that the new code could be tailored to just that one phone in particular, but modifying the code to attack other phones would be relatively simple. Apple also maintains (and the FBI has as good as conceded) that this case isn’t a one-off: it will set a legal precedent. And even if Apple deleted the tool as soon as the FBI was done with it, there would be a line around the block of district attorneys clutching iPhones in evidence baggies demanding that Apple write it all over again. “It’s not about one phone,” Cook says. “It’s very much about the future. You have a guy in Manhattan saying, I’ve got 175 phones that I want to take through this process.” (The guy in question being New York County district attorney Cyrus Vance, who did in fact say that.) This is the technical argument. Apple’s legal argument in the case hinges on the interpretation of the All Writs Act, which is something of a catchall: it authorizes federal courts to issue “all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” Apple’s lawyers argue that to compel the company to write, test, debug, deploy and document the necessary software would be excessively burdensome and exceed the bounds of the All Writs Act. (This isn’t the first time Apple has been on the business end of the All Writs Act, by a long chalk. In October a similar case came up in Brooklyn involving a meth dealer who claimed to have forgotten his iPhone pass code, and Apple made a similar argument. On Feb. 29 the judge ruled in Apple’s favor, though that ruling has no legal bearing on the San Bernardino case.) Apple also floated a slightly more fanciful claim to the effect that compelling Apple engineers to write code they objected to would violate their First Amendment rights. But these arguments are just the legal and technical shadows cast by another, larger one, which is that people have a right to privacy, and devices like the iPhone, with which we live on terms of unprecedented intimacy, provide both hackers and law enforcement with a way of invading that privacy like never before. Encryption is the only possible countermeasure. “When I think of civil liberties, I think of the founding principles of this country,” Cook says. “The freedoms that are in the First Amendment, but also the fundamental right to privacy. And the way that we simply see this is, if this All Writs Act can be used to force us to do something that would make millions of people vulnerable, then you can begin to ask yourself, If that can happen, what else can happen? In the next Senate you might say, Well, maybe it should be a surveillance OS. Maybe law enforcement would like the ability to turn on the camera on your Mac.” It’s an argument in favor not just of privacy but of a new kind of privacy, one forced on us by the utterly changed nature of the technological environment we now live in. Device by device, service by service, we have built over the past decade a world in which an amazing amount of what we do is recorded by our personal devices: our social lives, our health, our money, what we watch, who we talk to, where we go, what we look at. Ten years ago, if I went for a jog, any and all information relating to that jog would evaporate as soon as it happened. It would go uncaptured. Now that information is not only preserved–where I went, how far I went, how fast I went, what I listened to, what my heart rate was–it gets uploaded to the cloud and propagated across my social networks. The legal scholars Peter Swire and Kenesa Ahmad have coined a phrase for this: the Golden Age of Surveillance. Idly and thoughtlessly, purely because we like the little conveniences and personal services that smart devices give us, we have comprehensively bugged ourselves but good. Devices like Amazon’s Alexa or Samsung’s smart TVs or even Mattel’s Hello Barbie not only monitor the conversation around them but stream it to the cloud to be run through speech-recognition algorithms. They listen and report. George Orwell knew mass surveillance would invade our homes. The twist he didn’t see coming was that it wasn’t Big Brother who would do it. We did it to ourselves. “It wasn’t very long ago when you wouldn’t even think about there being health information on the smartphone,” Cook says. “There’s financial information. There’s your conversations, there’s business secrets. There’s probably more information about you on here than exists in your home.” The question is, now that we have this deeply, richly, intimately installed new surveillance infrastructure, should Big Brother be allowed to access it? And if so, when and how? Or should private citizens have the means to protect it, from hackers and thieves but also from the government? Oddly enough, this particular fight has actually been fought before, more than 20 years ago, in what is known as the Crypto Wars. In 1993, jittery in the face of the growing power of encryption, the White House announced a device called the Clipper Chip that would encrypt digital communications while allowing the government to keep a key. Needless to say, the industry resisted the Clipper Chip on any number of grounds, including the fact that it would render American-made communications technology distinctly unattractive to foreign buyers. By 1996 it was effectively dead, and by 2000 the government had thrown up its hands at the whole quixotic business of trying to legislate encryption. Strong encryption remained the exception rather than the rule, even as American cybersurveillance ramped up in the wake of Sept. 11. But by 2011 law enforcement was getting concerned again about its practical ability to monitor electronic communications. The FBI’s general counsel described them as “going dark,” a phrase that has become something of a rallying cry. After the Edward Snowden revelations in 2013, some technology companies began integrating encryption more tightly and seamlessly into their products and enabling it as the default setting–Apple’s iOS 8, released in 2014, was a watershed in that respect. Google’s next release of Android did the same. There were already rumblings about encryption legislation long before lightning struck in San Bernardino. Last year, the Washington Post quoted an email from Robert S. Litt, second general counsel in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which speculated, presciently, that the general climate for such legislation “could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.” And here we are. Law enforcement has long been accustomed to obtaining warrants to search almost anything it wants, subject to the limits spelled out in the Fourth Amendment. (That’s the one about “unreasonable searches and seizures.”) But encryption creates a new kind of warrant-proof space, a virtual bolt-hole in which private citizens can put the vast amounts of sensitive personal data they generate. It’s still accessible to law enforcement in theory, but in practice it’s impenetrable without a pass code. FBI Director James Comey put this new predicament starkly in a congressional hearing on the San Bernardino case in February. “Law enforcement, which I’m part of, really does save people’s lives, rescue kids, rescue neighborhoods from terrorists,” he said. “And we do that a whole lot through court orders that are search warrants. And we do it a whole lot through search warrants of mobile devices. So we’re gonna move to a world where that is not possible anymore? The world will not end, but it will be a different world than where we are today and where we were in 2014.” Comey, who declined to be interviewed on this subject, has framed the conflict as a choice between privacy and security, a zero-sum trade-off. If it were that simple, Apple would have a steep battle indeed: whatever benefits we get from encryption would have to be weighed against the possibility of lives lost to acts of terrorism. But Cook flatly rejects this view as a red herring. “I think it’s very simplistic and incorrect,” he says. “Because the reality is, let’s say you just pulled encryption. Let’s you and I ban it tomorrow. And so we sit in Congress and we say, Thou shalt not have encryption. What happens then? Well, I would argue that the bad guys will use encryption from non-American companies, because they’re pretty smart, and Apple doesn’t own encryption.” In other words, GovtOS wouldn’t help much, because there’s no legislating away encryption. The bad guys will remain encrypted as ever, no matter what. “The Internet doesn’t have boundaries,” Cook says. “You can wind up getting an app from Eastern Europe or Russia or wherever, it doesn’t matter which country, just outside the United States. And that app would give you end-to-end encryption.” Sure, you might get the data off Farook’s phone, but that’s the last one you’d get. Then you’re back where you started, except worse off, because everybody else’s crypto is now more vulnerable, with their data ripe for the pillaging. You’re only punishing the good guys. The stakes are rising on both sides. In 2015 alone, the federal Office of Personnel Management was hacked to the tune of 22 million personal records; hackers released 32 million accounts from AshleyMadison.com, a site that facilitates adultery; and Anthem, the IRS and the director of the CIA got hit as well. “Think about the things that are on people’s phones,” Cook says. “Their kids’ locations are on there. You can see scenarios that are not far-fetched at all where you can take down power grids by going through a smartphone.” This isn’t entirely speculative: in December somebody managed to take down part of the power grid in western Ukraine, leaving 230,000 people without electricity. “We think the government should be pushing for more encryption,” he says. “That it’s a great thing. You know, it’s like the sun and the air and the water.” Except that it protects terrorists as well as good guys. “We get that,” Cook says. “But you don’t take away the good for that sliver of bad. We’ve never been about that as a country. We make that decision every day, right? There are some times that freedom of speech, we might cringe a little when we hear that person saying this and wish they wouldn’t. This, to us, is like that. It’s at the core of who we are as a country.” Encryption is one of those technological realities that are so ubiquitous and powerful that they alter political realities–it has a whiff of revolution about it. It changes the balance of power between government and governed. Apple isn’t in the business of revolution, or not that kind anyway. Cook’s emphasis is on the extent to which encryption protects your data from the bad guys, the hackers and other malefactors, rather than from law enforcement–but at the same time he does convey a certain leeriness about the government’s unseemly eagerness to get at personal information. “I’m the FedEx guy,” Cook says. “I’m taking your package and I’m delivering it.” He doesn’t want Apple to be in the position of storing messages for the government to read. “I’m not saying that from a cost point of view or anything else, I’m saying it from an ethics and values point of view. You don’t want me to hold all that stuff. Right? I think you guys should have a reasonable expectation that your communication is private.” He also points out that the All Writs Act doesn’t specify what kinds of criminal investigations it applies to. “This case was domestic terrorism, but a different court might view that robbery is one. A different one might view that a tax issue is one. A different one might view that a divorce issue would be O.K. And so we saw this huge thing opening and thought, You know, if this is where we’re going, somebody should pass a law that makes it very clear what the boundaries are. This thing shouldn’t be done court by court by court by court.” (Cook can’t completely conceal his irritation at the un-Apple-ish vagueness of the All Writs Act: “You can tell it was written over 200 years ago.” As if to say, they ought to let Jony Ive loose on that thing, get it milled to the proper tolerances, upgrade it to a respectable level of precision.) Whether it will or won’t be decided by courts is an open question. The FBI, in a series of increasingly strident court filings, has accused Apple of undermining “the very institutions that are best able to safeguard our liberty and our rights: the courts, the Fourth Amendment, long-standing precedent and venerable laws, and the democratically elected branches of government.” It has also threatened, not very subtly, to unleash a nuclear option: subpoena the iOS source code and Apple’s “private electronic signature,” the certificate with which it identifies its code as valid to its devices, which is the software equivalent of the secret name of God. As for Cook’s talk about privacy and civil liberties, the FBI dismisses it as “marketing.” It’s fair to say that emotions are running high on both sides. “Do I like their tactics?” Cook says. “No, I don’t. I’m seeing the government apparatus in a way I’ve never seen it before. Do I like finding out from the press about it? No, I don’t think it’s professional. Do I like them talking about or lying about our intentions? No. I’m offended by it. Deeply offended by it.” To be sure, Cook has been positioning Apple as a defender of personal privacy for some time now, at the expense of several of his key rivals–Cook is fond of pointing out that Apple’s business model doesn’t involve harvesting and mining its users’ data the way that, say, Google, Facebook and Amazon do. (At Apple a lack of interest in customer information is practically gospel–Jobs used to claim that Apple didn’t even use focus groups.) Cook’s stance is also of a piece with Apple’s well-known obsession with top-down control of every detail of its products. For the government to come in and get its grubby, inky federal fingers on Apple’s perfect gleaming code must be excruciating at 1 Infinite Loop. It’s ironic that Cook’s tough stand on privacy has forced him further into the spotlight. By nature he’s as intensely private as the CEO of Apple can be. It also represents another step in a curious trend that has Silicon Valley engineers increasingly acting like statesmen and policymakers, taking positions and making decisions on political and social issues. As more and more of our social and cultural fabric gets integrated into the Internet, power over that fabric is being siphoned off, through mysterious cross-country subterranean channels, from Washington to Northern California. “We’re in this bizarre position where we’re defending the civil liberties of the country against the government,” Cook says. “I mean, I never expected to be in this position. The government should always be the one defending civil liberties, and yet there’s a role reversal here. I still feel like I’m in another world, that I’m in this bad dream.” Cook is doing his best to wake up. He says he doesn’t actually want to make this decision. What he’s pushing for is to get it out of the hands of a judge and into Congress; a commission could study the issue and presumably propose some sensible laws to clarify it. “We see that this is our moment to stand up and say, Stop and force a dialogue,” he says. “There’s been too many times that government is just so strong and so powerful and so loud that they really just limit or they don’t hear the discourse.” He stresses that whatever the outcome, when the law is handed down, Apple will follow it. In the meantime, product development in Cupertino will continue to race ahead at the speed of technology, which is considerably faster than that of congressional commissions. It has been reported–though not confirmed–that Apple is evolving a version of the iPhone that even it couldn’t crack, not even with the help of GovtOS. It’s theoretically possible: if, just for example, the 10-guess requirement in iOS 9 could be incorporated into the phone’s hardware, rather than its software, then even modifying the operating system wouldn’t get rid of it. No one talks about future products at Apple–to do so would bring the ghost of Jobs howling back from Silicon Valhalla–but Cook says nothing that makes me think it’s not going to happen. “I would never do what you’re saying with the intention of doing that,” is how he puts it. “Our intention is never anything to do with government. It’s to protect people. Is it a consequence of it? Yes, I mean, over time you do more and more and more. That’s the road we’ve been on for a decade.” The effect would be to render controversies like the present one moot and remove Apple from the legal equation completely, bootstrapping it out like the Lorax. Cook also suggests that with all those huge invisible billowing clouds of data we leave behind everywhere we go, the encrypted data on phones just isn’t that big a deal anymore. Law enforcement shouldn’t be whining about iPhones; it should be rolling around in all the other free information that criminals and terrorists are spewing through social networks and Nest thermostats, surveillance cameras and Hello Barbies. Apple even has the keys to iCloud backups, which are readily subpoenable, so why get hung up on the device itself? Which, by the way, 10 years ago didn’t even exist? “Going dark–this is a crock,” Cook says. “No one’s going dark. I mean really, it’s fair to say that if you send me a message and it’s encrypted, they can’t get that without going to you or to me, unless one of us has it in our cloud at this point. But we shouldn’t all be fixated just on what’s not available. We should take a step back and look at the total that’s available, because there’s a mountain of information about us.” Its slightly exasperated tone aside, this argument echoes the findings of a report published in February by Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society and signed by an impressive roster of legal and security professionals. The report points out that there are powerful trends at work that balance the spread of encryption: the prevalence of business models that rely on mining users’ data; the growth of cloud computing, which puts data on central servers that are more easily accessible; and the proliferation of networked devices referred to collectively as the Internet of Things. “These are prime mechanisms for surveillance,” the report says, “alternative vectors for information-gathering that could more than fill many of the gaps left behind by sources that have gone dark–so much so that they raise troubling questions about how exposed to eavesdropping the general public is poised to become.” In fact, we seem to be going through two equal and opposite crises at the same time, depending on who you listen to. On the one hand we’re going dark, and on the other we’re giving away our privacy left and right. These are local effects that need to be integrated into a bigger picture. Bottom line: the Internet is a vast, messy, porous place, and that same messiness that makes encryption impossible to regulate also means that however strong and seamless and pervasive encryption gets, it can only ever cover a fraction of the data that flows out of us all day, every day. The next round in the shoving match between Apple and the FBI is set for March 22, when both sides will appear at a hearing in federal court in Riverside, Calif. Sooner or later, all that shoving will have to yield to a delicate balance, one that takes into account the realities of what encryption is and what it isn’t, and leaves us with a legal framework strong and clear enough to spare us from having to refight the Crypto Wars a third time. “You know as well as I do, sometimes the way we get somewhere, our journey is very ugly,” Cook says. “But I’m a big optimist that we ultimately arrive at the right thing.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4261796/tim-cook-transcript/"], "sentiment_score": 0.07254357623809322, "subjectivity_score": 0.43931770289472594},

That is the subject of the magazine’s March 28 cover story, available here. What follows is a full transcript of their conversation: To start with why don’t we roll back to last fall. There was a case that came up in Brooklyn, a drug dealer, the judge reached out to Apple and asked how you guys felt about getting information off the phone. Apple had gone along with similar requests prior to that. And in this case, Apple pushed back. Why the change? COOK: The difference is that that judge asked us if we felt this was a proper use of the All Writs Act. Before judges would order us to do X or Y—we’ve never been asked to do what we’ve been asked to do now, so this case is materially different—but back then the question the judge asked us that we’d never been asked was if we felt the government was properly using this Act. And we went back and said no, we don’t. We don’t think the government has the authority to do this. And our thinking has been that if you look back at the history of this discussion, because this discussion’s been going on for a while—CALEA, not to get too technical, but CALEA is essentially the regulatory arm for the telecommunications area. And there was a decision in the Congress to not have technology covered under, think about it as CALEA 2. And so the Congress passed. And our view has been that the use of this is inappropriate. That doesn’t mean that we didn’t get the judges using it. But this judge said, I don’t want to just order it, I want to understand your view of whether this is a proper use. That was the first time that we’d ever been asked that before. We went back and put our argument together and said that no, we think it’s inappropriate. Now in that case, what occurred was that the accused confessed, so the details of the case itself became completely unimportant. But the broader issue of, can the government use the All Writs Act to compel Apple to extract data from a phone, was still very important. So when we saw the government going not only to this extent, but now going to a greater degree and asking us to develop a product, a new product that takes out all the security aspects, and makes it a simple process for them to guess many thousand different combinations of passwords or passcodes, we said you know, that case is now important. That question is now important, even though the details are no longer important. So we went back and asked that judge to rule on that. We’d been waiting, but we thought maybe he’s not going to do anything anymore since the case itself is no longer important. And so we filed, and that’s a public filing. He asked us for more information about our point that the government was using this more and in increasingly significant ways. And then he asked the government to respond again. And then ruled —last Monday I think it was. Now rolling forward to San Bernardino, just setting the scene, can you give us a little bit of the narrative? How did you find out about the government’s request? How did you feel about it? Who did you talk to? How did you arrive at the decision that you did? COOK: I think the attack itself happened midweek, Wednesday or Thursday, if I remember correctly, and we didn’t hear anything for a few days. I think it was Saturday before we were contacted. We have a desk, if you will, set up to take requests from government. It’s set up 24/7, not as a result of this. it’s been going for a while. The call came into that desk, and they presented us with a warrant as it relates to this specific phone. There were other phones involved, as I understand it, other phones that the shooters were using that they destroyed. This one was left intact. And so we filled the warrant. The warrant was for all information that we had about that phone, and so we passed that information, which for us was a cloud backup on the phone, and some other metadata, if you will, that we would have about the phone. I suspect—I don’t know but I suspect—that they also gave the carrier a warrant, because they obviously have the ability to get the phone metadata and the metadata of messages that go across the cellular network. So there’s several different pieces of information they can gather on the phone. Some time passed, quite a bit of time, over a month I believe, and they came back and said we want to get some additional information. And we said well, here’s what we would suggest. So we gave them some unsolicited advice. We said, take the phone to the home or apartment and power it, plug it in and let it back up. And as it turned out they came back and said, well, that didn’t work. And we said, well, why? We need to understand this, we sent engineers and so forth, and we found out that they had directed the county in the early going, likely before we were ever involved, to reset the iCloud password. As you know, if you reset your iCloud password, the only way for the phone to back up is for you to put the new password in the phone. You can’t put the new password in the phone if it is pass code protected. So unfortunately that didn’t work. So we were helping. We were consulting in addition to passing the information that we had on the phone, which was all the information that we had. Some more time passed, and they started talking to us about how they might sue, or they may put a claim in. But they never told us whether they were going to do it or not. By then it’s seventy-five days or so from the attack. I think most people here felt like it wouldn’t occur, and I felt that if it would occur, I would get a call. And that didn’t happen. We found out about it actually from the press, who were being briefed about it in advance of the filing. That means they elected to not file it under seal, in order to get the visibility on it, I guess, and try to swing the public, and decided not to reach out on it.  We found out about it actually from the press, who were being briefed about it in advance of the filing.  So we then had a decision of what should we do. Of course we had previously decided—because they had asked us to do the thing that we’re calling government OS, the new operating system without the security controls—and we had long discussions about that internally, when they had asked us. Lots of people internally were involved. It wasn’t just me sitting in a room somewhere deciding that way, it was a labored decision. We thought about all the things you would think we would think about. So we had already decided before the suit hit that this wasn’t a good thing for people. From a customer point of view it wasn’t good, because it would wind up putting millions of customers at risk, making them more vulnerable. In addition, we felt like it trampled on civil liberties, not only for our customers but in the broader sense. It felt like different points in history, almost, in the U.S., where the government overreached for whatever reason. And we were dead set in the path of it. So we knew it was wrong. It was wrong on so many levels. And so when we saw the suit, when the suit actually hit, it was then more about, how do we communicate to the Apple community why we’re doing what we’re doing? Because we knew that on the surface, why won’t you open this phone, you know, most people would quickly jump to yeah, you should do this. As we would want to if it didn’t have all these other implications to it. So it then became more about being clear and straightforward about why we were doing what we were doing. When you say civil liberties, what do you mean exactly? What does that mean to you? COOK: It means a lot of things. When I think of civil liberties I think of the founding principles of the country. The freedoms that are in the First Amendment. But also the fundamental right to privacy. And the way that we simply see this is, if this All Writs Act can be used to force us to do something would make millions of people vulnerable, then you can begin to ask yourself, if that can happen, what else can happen? In the next senate you might say, well, maybe it should be a surveillance OS done. Maybe law enforcement would like the ability to turn on the camera on your Mac. But it wasn’t clear at all. Because if you read the All Writs Act, you can tell it was written over two hundred years ago. It’s a very open ended kind of thing that was clearly meant to fill in the crevices of laws that didn’t exist yet in the country. So we saw this slippery slope there. And also the act itself doesn’t look at the crime, it doesn’t look at the reason the government wants it. It looks at the burden to the company that it’s asking to do it. So this case was domestic terrorism, but a different court might view that robbery is one. A different once might view that a tax issue is one. A different one might view that a divorce issue would be okay. We saw this huge thing opening and thought, you know, if this is where we’re going, somebody should pass a law that makes it very clear what the boundaries are. This thing shouldn’t be done court by court by court by court.  We saw this huge thing opening and thought, you know, if this is where we’re going, somebody should pass a law that makes it very clear what the boundaries are. This thing shouldn’t be done court by court by court by court.  Particularly looking at the history. The Congress made a conscious decision not to do this. It’s not like, oh, this technology is so new, it’s never been thought of before. It’s not like that. So we saw that being a huge civil liberties slide. We saw us creating a back door—we think it’s fundamentally wrong. And not just wrong from a privacy point of view, but wrong from a public safety point of view. Think about the things that are on people’s phones. Their kids’ locations are on there. You can see scenarios that are not farfetched at all where you can take down power grids going through a smart phone. So there’s all kinds of things that as we looked at it, we think the government should be pushing for more encryption. That it’s a great thing. It’s like the sun and the air and the water. It’s a superb thing. And certainly some things that are very good can sometimes be used in a bad way. We get that. But you don’t take away the good for that sliver of bad. We’ve never been about that as a country. We make that decision every day, right? There are some times that freedom of speech—we might cringe a little when we hear that person saying this, and wish they wouldn’t, but we think about the alternative of not having that freedom. We think about freedom of the press. You just go on and on and on. We all cringe occasionally, but then we think about if you begin to restrict and limit and box. Pretty soon it’s not the country that we’re a part of anymore. It’s not America anymore. This to us is like that. It’s at the core of who we are as a country. And you know, it wasn’t very long ago that all this stuff was being debated. It’s not like it hasn’t been discussed. So this seemed like a back door of the back door. You know, trying to force someone to put a back door in, making people more vulnerable. Clearly trampling on civil liberties. I mean, I think it’s hard to debate these things. I think these things are unequivocally what is going on. And if they are to go on, they should go on out in the open, in the Congress, and the Congress should pass a law. Because those are the people that we vote on to represent us. You know we don’t elect people in government in appointed positions, and for the most part we don’t elect judges, and so forth. And courts can have different views, and I think they would. We know that. It’s our system, and it’s the great thing about our system. But in something so fundamental, this should be talked about. Now for us, and this is so key, I believe that if you took privacy and you said, I’m willing to give up all of my privacy to be secure. So you weighted it as a zero. My own view is that encryption is a much better, much better world. And I’m not the only person that thinks that. You know, Michael Hayden thinks that, and he ran the NSA so that’s a point of view we should all listen to. So you can see not only data theft and theft of all different things, but you then begin to think about the public safety aspects of it. And to me it is so clear that even if you discount the importance of privacy, that encryption is the way to go. I’m hoping that that comes out strong. Once again, I think it came out once in the Congress and they said, we’re not doing anything to limit this.I think it happened in the administration as well and they said, we’re not going to seek any legislation on this. So I think we need to go through that again and hope everybody comes to the same conclusion. Do you feel as though the FBI intentionally took a case that was obviously very emotional, it’s the ultimate domestic terrorism case, not so much because there is vital evidence on that phone, but because they knew that they were going to make this the hardest version of the debate? COOK: I think they picked a case to pursue that they felt they had the strongest possibility of winning. Is there something on the phone? I don’t know. I don’t think anybody really knows. The thing that some people point out, or have pointed out to me, is that the other phones are smashed. One of the family members of the victim came out last week and said everybody knew these phones were monitored. In fact he said they had the GPS app on the phone that allowed the county to track the employees because the employees were field employees. And I’m sure they did it from a safety point of view. And the FBI waited seventy-five days. I guess that’s the other thing that some people pointed out. But I don’t know, is the real answer. Do you feel ambushed? COOK: No, I don’t feel ambushed. What I feel is that in a professional way, if I’m working with you for several months on things, if I have a relationship with you, and I decide one day I’m going to sue you, I’m a country boy at the end of the day. I’m going to pick up the phone and tell you I’m going to sue you. And so do I like their tactics? No. I don’t. I’m seeing the government apparatus in a way I’ve never seen it before. Do I like finding out from the press about it? No. I don’t think it’s professional. So do I like them talking about, or lying, about our intentions? No. I’m offended by it. Deeply offended by it. However, putting all of that emotion aside, I think the dialogue that is happening now with a lot of different people and a lot of different view points, people that agree with us and disagree with us, I think it’s healthy and it’s a part of democracy. So that part I’m really excited about. And I’m optimistic that we’ll get to the right conclusion. And again, when I say that I’m separating, the court’s going to do what it’s going to do. But you were asking about the broader policy issue, I think, and I’m excited now that people are engaged once again. I thought we’d already done this, to be honest. But I think we have to do it again. And that’s fine. So I do think that’s positive. I don’t think the whole thing is negative. But there are parts of their approach that I think are heavy-handed and not the country I love. Have you spoken to the President? COOK: Not about this case. You talk about public safety. Encryption is obviously incredibly valuable as a tool for preserving public safety. As against that, there’s a long an honorable tradition of law enforcement being able to get access to information that it needs to investigate crimes. And that also helps us with public safety. So you’re weighing one against the other, right? It’s not like it’s black and white. It’s you have to make a tradeoff. Or am I wrong in saying that? COOK: Well, first of all, I don’t make the tradeoff. That’s the Congress’s job, to pass laws and so forth. But no, I don’t see it like that. I know everybody wants to paint it as privacy versus security, as if you can give up one and get more of the other. I think it’s very simplistic and incorrect. I don’t see it that way at all. Because the reality is that if you—let’s say you just pulled encryption. Let’s ban it. Let’s you and I ban it tomorrow. And so we sit in Congress and we say, thou shalt not have encryption. What happens then? Well, I would argue that the bad guys will use encryption from non-American companies, because they’re pretty smart and encryption isn’t—I don’t own encryption, Apple doesn’t own encryption. Encryption, as you know, is everywhere. In fact some of encryption is funded by our government. Some of the best encryption is funded by the government. But you’ll see encryption coming out of most countries in the world.  I don’t own encryption, Apple doesn’t own encryption. Encryption, as you know, is everywhere. In fact some of encryption is funded by our government.  So if you’re worried about messaging, which I think is primarily the worry in this scenario, people will just move to something else. You know if you legislate against Facebook and Apple and Google and whatever else in the US, they’ll just use something else. So are we really safer then? I would say no. I would say we’re less safe, because now we’ve opened up all of the infrastructure for people to go wacko at. You’ve already seen people hitting the U.S. government—they pulled twenty million peoples’ information out from Social Security, their thumbprints and everything else. You see people going after private companies. You see people going after consumers. So the reality of today from a cyber security point of view—I think some of the top people predict that the next big war is fought on cyber security. So you want to have an unbelievable defense. You probably want to have an offense too, but that’s somebody else’s job, to worry about that. So the act of banning or limiting or putting a back door in—a back door is any vulnerability that if I can get in, that means somebody else can. We look at it pretty simply as, we want to encrypt end to end. And if you guys are sending a message to each other, you have the ability to read it by putting your passcode in and decrypting it. Nancy has the ability to read it, but nobody else does. So it’s just a simple thing. We don’t feel like we should be in the middle of that. I’m the FedEx guy. I’m taking your package and I’m delivering it. I just do it like this. My job isn’t to open it up, make a copy of it, put it over in my cabinet in case somebody later wants to come say, I’d like to see your messages. That’s not a role that I play. It’s not a role that I think I should play. And it’s certainly not a role I think you want me to play. I don’t think so, anyway. I don’t feel like the storage compartment for trillions of messages. And I’m not saying that from a cost point of view or anything else, I’m saying it from an ethics and values point of view. You don’t want me to hold all that stuff, right? I think you guys should have a reasonable expectation that your communication is private. That’s a new development though, right? It didn’t used to— COOK: No, from the start, from the very start of Messages, when—you were here when we launched it. We launched it with end-to-end encryption. And so this didn’t just happen, we didn’t suddenly think of this after Snowden. I know everybody says that, but it’s not true. Facetime, end-to-end encrypted from the start. I don’t mean it’s new to Apple, I mean in a broader sense, it didn’t use to be the case that private citizens could actually take information and put it in this place, not a literal space but a virtual space, that was inaccessible to law enforcement. That is new, is it not? COOK: Some of it is new. It’s hard for me to make a blanket statement like that. But yes, I mean with hacking getting more and more sophisticated, the hacking community has gone from the hobbyist in the basement to huge sophisticated companies that are essentially doing this, or groups of people or foreign agents inside and outside the United States. People are running huge enterprises off of hacking and stealing data. So yes, every software release we do, we get more and more secure. And we’ve been doing it for years. That path, the path toward more security and more privacy is a path we’ve been on for a long time. It’s not one that we just ventured on a year ago or two years ago or whatever. Right. Your position is—I’m putting this in childishly cartoonish terms—that we’ve got to keep the hackers out, and if that means we keep the government out as well, so be it. It’s a trade off. COOK: Yes. It’s not that—I’m not targeting government. I’m not saying hey, I’m closing it because I don’t want to give you any data. I’m saying that to protect out customers, we have to encrypt. And a side affect of that is, I don’t have the data. But I wouldn’t go the step further that you went to and say that means the government is out. Because think about this—now, we have an unusual case in the south, so forget about that case for a minute and let’s talk about a normal case.  I’m not targeting government. I’m saying that to protect out customers, we have to encrypt. And a side affect of that is, I don’t have the data.  Let’s say they have a problem with you. They can come to you and say, open your phone. And one way is for it to be between the government and you. Then you can, I don’t know, they could pass a law that says you have to do it, or you have to do it or there’s some penalty, or something. That’s for somebody else to decide. But it does seem like it should be between you and them. Except if I’m dead, or like in the drug dealer case I forgot my pass code. COOK: You can’t—there’s probably not something that covers every single thing. And so—and this is one of the issues—if in order to cover the rare exception, you put a back door in, think about the consequences of the back door. You know, you can’t have a back door that says, good people only. It doesn’t work that way. So what’s to stop financial institutions from saying we want it to be impossible for the government to have access to financial records? COOK: I don’t know their infrastructure as well, but they use encryption significantly. Without encryption, you and I wouldn’t be able to do our banking online. We wouldn’t be able to buy things online, because your credit cards—they’ve probably been ripped off anyway, but they would be ripped off left and right every day if there wasn’t encryption. The thing that is different to me about Messages versus your banking institution is, the part of you doing business with the bank, they need to record what you deposited, what your withdrawals are, what your checks that have cleared. So they need all of this information. That content they need to possess, because they report it back to you. That’s the business they’re in. Take the message. My business is not reading your messages. I don’t have a business doing that. And it’s against my values to do that. I don’t want to read your private stuff. So I’m just the guy toting your mail over. That’s what I’m doing. So if I’m expected to keep your messages, and everybody else’s, then there should be a law that says, you need to keep all of these. Now I think that would be really bad. I think it would be really bad because in order for me to keep them, I have to have a way to see them. If I have to have a way to see them and a place to copy them, you can imagine—if you knew where the treasure was buried at, and everybody else did, then it puts a bull’s eye on that target. And in the world of cyber security, the last thing you want is to have a target painted on you. I’m not just saying that from an Apple point of view, but if it’s painted anywhere. No one should have a key that turns a billion locks. It shouldn’t exist. No one should have the message content for all of these messages. You wouldn’t want it all in one place. I think it would be very bad for security and privacy. If I know what your messages are, if I can read those, I’ll probably be able to conclude where you’re going, who you’re with, the location the message was sent.  No one should have a key that turns a billion locks. It shouldn’t exist.  I mean, the location the message was sent the phone company would have anyway probably, if it goes across the cellular network. But there’s just a lot of information there that can have implications on your safety, or your loved ones’ safety. So being mindful of the fallacy of the hypothetical, suppose on the other side of the door is the nuclear device that’s on a timer, or the child who’s being tortured. And you have a key to that door. COOK: If I had a key to that door I would turn that door. But that’s not the issue here, just to be clear. It’s not that I have information on this phone, and I’m not giving it. I had information. I gave all of it. Now they’re saying, hey, you could invent something to grab some additional information. We’re not sure there’s anything on there, but we want you to invent this in case there is. And the thing that they want me to invent, that key can turn millions of locks. But that just argues that their rationale isn’t as strong as it should be. It may not exist. We don’t know if there’s anything valuable on that phone. COOK: I’m actually—forget that, because I’m not substituting my judgment for theirs on the phone. I think they’ve said what I’ve said. They don’t know if there’s anything on it. I think everybody’s said that. I think Comey says maybe there is, maybe there’s not. So I think everybody recognizes that there may not be anything on it, there may be something on it. What I’m saying is, to invent what they want me to invent puts millions of people at risk. And it’s not about one phone. It’s very much about the future. You have a guy in Manhattan saying I’ve got a hundred and seventy-five phones that I want to take through this process. You’ve got other cases springing up all over the place where they want phones taken through the process. So it’s not about one phone, and they know it’s not about one phone. I mean, that’s a purpose of the case, to set a precedent to get a process so they can kind of turn a crank without regard to what the case is about, honestly. Right? It’s anything a court would say to use it for. But is your point then that the courts are not the right place? You talked about if Congress wants to do this, pass a law. But you’re also saying it would be absolutely bad for Apple to build this. COOK: Yes. Whether it’s Congress that tells you to do that— COOK: I am saying that. —or the courts. In that case, aren’t you putting yourself and your judgment in front of any democratic processes, as well as a legal process? COOK: No, because at the end of the day I’ll follow the law. But in our view there’s no law today that says I have to do this. The government is saying that this two hundred-plus year old law gives them the right to tell me I have to do it. I look at that and say, come on guys, this is crazy. That’s not right, and you know it’s not right.  At the end of the day I’ll follow the law. But in our view there’s no law today that says I have to do this.  So that dispute is going to happen in court now, but on the larger issue of encryption and back doors, to me that is a Congressional topic, because it has huge implications across many different areas. Someone needs to take a step back and look at public safety. They need to look at national security. They need to look at cyber security. They need to look at privacy. They need to look at other civil liberties. To me Congress is the natural place that is set up in our three-branch structure in order to weigh such things. And if at the outcome, if they conclude that they want to limit or ban encryption, or force a back door, then they clearly have the right to do that. Because they can pass a law. And if the President signs it, it becomes law. Do I think that will happen? No. I think there’s too much evidence to suggest that that’s bad for national security. It means we’re really throwing out founding principles on the side of the road. So I think there’s so many things to suggest that they wouldn’t do that. That’s not something I lose sleep over. I’m very optimistic, I have got to be, that in a debate, a public debate, all of these things will rise up and you’ll see sanity take over. You know as well as I do, sometimes the way we get somewhere, our journey is very ugly. But I’m a big optimist that we ultimately arrive at the right thing. Yes, there’s been cases that that doesn’t happen. But I optimistically think that it will. So what I would like to see is, we think it should be studied. This was the commission idea. The reason we’re saying that is not to punt, it’s where somebody can look at all of these implications. Right now we have one part of government looking at one thing. They’re looking at, how do I get the most information to solve this case? Or maybe not to solve it, because they may have it solved, but get the most information on this case. I’m saying, guys, what you’re asking me to do has a lot more implications than this case. This is something that to me is a basic responsibility that they have. If somebody studies it, and the right people are on it, the right debate happens, which I think is largely happening today, then I think what will come out of it is people will stop talking about weakening or banning encryption. We’ll have a huge pro-encryption stance that people will rally around, that it’s a good thing, that it’s a great thing and a necessary thing. I think that people will conclude that no back doors are the best, and the US should take a position that leads in the world by saying, no back doors anywhere. I think that Congress will do something to empower the different intelligence arms to build out a set of capabilities, new capabilities. to do their roles I the modern world, and encryption being a part of that. That won’t need you doing it for them? COOK: Correct. But I’d like to talk about that for a moment, just to—you’ll hear the words “going dark,” or “warrantless,” or these kinds of words. This is how I see it, is right now, if somebody wanted information about Lev they could go to—who’s your carrier? Verizon. They could subpoena Verizon, lay a warrant on Verizon. They would find out all the calls you’ve made, who they were made to, the length of the call, the time of the call. They could find out a lot of location data. They would find out messages that you sent across the cellular network, where you were. Lots of information. If they get at my Nike app, my running times are terrible. COOK: They may also learn that, right. I don’t know, I can’t speak for Nike on that. But they would know, they would come to us, and they would ask for some information, and if they had a valid warrant we would fill that. They would also probably spend a lot of time looking at things you’d done online, right, because there’s lots of things done in the public eye. The truth is, this is the golden age of surveillance that we live in. There is more information about all of us, so much more than ten years ago, or five years ago. It’s everywhere. You are leaving digital footprints everywhere. Also there’s cameras everywhere, and I mean not just security cameras, but we all have a camera in our pocket. So if you want to know something that happened at a particular scene, you could probably find photos of that. Thanks to you. COOK: Thanks to, yes, partly, us. That’s right. And so my only point is, going dark is not—this is a crock. No one’s going dark. I mean really, it’s fair to say that if you send me a message and it’s encrypted, it’s fair to say they can’t get that without going to you or to me, unless one of us has it in our cloud at this point. That’s fair to say. But we shouldn’t all be fixated just on what’s not available. We should take a step back and look at the total that’s available. Because there’s a mountain of information about us. I mean there’s so much. Anyway, I’m not an intelligence person. But I just look at it and it’s a mountain of data. As a business person, as the guy running Apple, should this go to Congress, they rule, goes against you, how bad is it for Apple from a business point of view? COOK: I think, first of all it’s bad for the United States. Because going against us doesn’t just mean going against us. It means likely banning, limiting or forcing back doors for [everyone]. I think it makes the U.S. much more vulnerable. Not only in privacy but also in security. The national infrastructure, everything. And I can’t imagine it happening because it would be outlandish for something like that to happen. I think everybody has better judgment than that. But at the end of the day, we’re going to fight the good fight not only for our customers but for the country. We’re in this bizarre position where we’re defending the civil liberties of the country against the government. Who would have ever thought this would happen? I never expected to be in this position. The government should always be the one defending civil liberties. And there’s a role reversal here. I mean I still feel like I’m in another world a bit, that I’m in this bad dream in some wise.  We’re in this bizarre position where we’re defending the civil liberties of the country against the government. Who would have ever thought this would happen?  So I don’t expect that the country wants that. You know we flirt with different things over different times. But we always come back to our core. And so is it bad for Apple? I think it’s bad for America, really bad for America. And I don’t expect it’ll happen. I don’t think it’ll happen. There’s too many bright people around. Do you find it odd that now your job description includes weighing questions of public and private security, questions of privacy, right and wrong? Is it odd to you to be thrust into that role? COOK: Yes. It feels very uncomfortable in some ways. Fighting the government is not a thing we choose to do. America is always stronger when we do things together. And so in my view the right approach here is for technology and intelligence to talk about the things we can do [together]. Ways we can have both privacy and security. Not view the world as this see-saw. I think this is a really strange way to see this. But it’s something that we’re fighting willingly. The easiest thing for us would have been to just do it. That would have been easy. But it’s not right. And so I think at the end of the day—and none of us would have been able to sleep at night. We would have felt we had sold out. But that doesn’t make it comfortable.It is shocking to me that the U.S. is the only country in the world that has asked this. If I had heard it from, I don’t know, from some other country or something, then maybe it would feel a little different. But the U.S. should be the shining city on the hill, the beacon of civil liberties. This is just one of those cases where occasionally the government over reaches and doesn’t act in the best interest of its citizens. But I’m optimistic that we’ll get through it and get to a much better place. From a technological point of view, is the optimal path forward that you guys just engineer yourselves out of this loop? Make is to that you couldn’t even supply the government OS that would do what the government is asking you to do? COOK: I think with every release we do, we have to go up. Because we have to try to stay one step ahead of the bad guys out there. The truth is that our security today will not be good enough for tomorrow. That’s true. You have to accept that whether you’re sitting here or any other companies around this valley. Security isn’t just a feature, it’s a base, it’s a fundamental, right. I would never do what you’re saying with the intention of doing that. Our intention is never anything to do with government, it’s to protect people. Is it a consequence of it? Yes, I mean over time you do more and more and more. That’s the road we’ve been on for a decade. Actually more than that I guess if you think about the Mac, encryption has been I the Mac since the ‘80s, the end of the ‘80s or something like that, right. So it’s not — What do you think it says about the changed information environment in which we live? What you alluded to earlier, just the vast clouds of data which we now generate by virtue of going about our daily business. We’re just sort of spewing out gigabytes of data, everything we do, to the point where privacy, it changes what privacy means. Now privacy becomes, rather than the default setting of the world that we live in, not it becomes a feature that we have to buy and shop for and rely on. Is that a change you’ve observed over the course of your career? COOK: I think your observation that there’s this increasing amounts of data is absolutely true. It wasn’t very long ago, you wouldn’t even think about there being health information on the smart phone. But today there’s a lot of health information available on your smart phone. There’s financial information. There’s your conversations, there’s business secrets. There’s an enormous long list of things that there’s probably more information about you on here than exists in your home, right. Which makes it a lot more valuable to all the bad guys out there. That’s a reality. That data is increasing in phenomenal leaps and bounds all the time, along with the sort of the hacking and cyber issues are going up at the same time. So these two curves are pointed in the same direction. Partly, and no surprise, because there’s so much more information out there. It’s clear why hacking communities are [growing]. Because it’s like, there’s a lot more gold there. There’s a lot more to steal than ever before. There’s unbelievably nefarious things happening out there. I think those two curves are connected, are very strongly correlated with each other. I think that [there is] this fundamental right to privacy and the philosophy that government shouldn’t be intrusive. To me, that is the same. I don’t think because this is escalating that that should fundamentally be different. Now do people, do different companies etc. look at privacy different? Yes, they clearly do. And that’s the reason all of us have privacy policies and some you can actually read and you can look at these things and judge for yourself where you see it. But I think the fundamental right that’s there is a constitutional right. I mean this is something that is basic to who we are. It’s not something that floats with technology. To be honest I oscillate from side to side on this issue. And it troubles me to think of should god forbid a future act of domestic terrorism occurs, who knows, it gets linked back to that phone in San Bernardino, we could have spotted it coming. How do you weigh the lives lost there against the diminution of millions of people’s privacy, not an abolition of it, but degradation of their privacy? It involves a lot of difficult calculus. COOK: You’re clicking back to privacy versus security though. And I think it’s privacy and security or privacy and safety versus security. It’s not that people’s wellbeing, their physical wellbeing is not a part of privacy. It is. It very much is. It’s not that one side has life and one has side is a your financial information or your photo or whatever, it’s not that. Think about something that happens to the infrastructure, where there’s a power grid issue. Sure, just happened. COOK: Think about the people that are on a device, a medical device that depends on electricity. And of course hospitals have generators etc, but there’s a lot of people out in homes that do not. These are real things, these aren’t fantasy things by any means. Both sides are real though, I mean … is real. COOK: Both sides are real. And yes, both sides are real. But giving up one doesn’t get you more of that. Because what’s going to happen—again, I get back to what I see is, if you limit us, the internet doesn’t have boundaries. And so you can wind up getting an app from Eastern Europe, or Russia or wherever, it doesn’t matter which country, just outside the United States. And that app would give you end to end encryption. The terrorists is smart enough to use that. But we’re trying to protect everyday people. Everybody doesn’t want to have to be a computer scientist to protect themselves. Most people have no desire to do that. That’s the fundamentalIt’s one of those things that people might feel good for a moment. They passed a law, and everybody goes ‘Whew.’ But then when you look at the reality, the bad guys still use it, and they’re still in the shadow. And who have you exposed? You’ve exposed the 99% of good people. When Donald Trump calls for a boycott of Apple products, do you think that’s because he doesn’t understand the arguments that you’re making? COOK: I haven’t talked to him so I don’t know what he thinks. The way I look at it is, Apple is this great American company that could have only happened here. And we see it as our responsibility to stand up on something like this and speak up for all these people that are thinking what we’re thinking but don’t have the voice.  We see it as our responsibility to stand up on something like this and speak up for all these people that are thinking what we’re thinking but don’t have the voice.  We don’t see it as our role as the decision maker. We understand Congress sets laws. But we [see] it as our role not to just let it happen. I mean too many times in history has this happened, where the government over reached, did something that in retrospect somebody should have stood up and said ‘Stop.’ We see that this is our moment to stand up and say ‘Stop.’ And force a dialogue. And that dialogue may, I don’t know how it’ll go. I’m optimistic. But I don’t know at the end of the day. But I see that as our role. What kind of over reach are you thinking of, when you think of the historical? COOK: I can think of really bad things where things were done that I’m sure people looked at and thought were good at the time. And nobody said anything. I do think this is something that I think will affect the wellbeing of citizens of the U.S. for decades to come, that will affect civil liberties for decades to come. This is of that kind of stature and of that kind of importance. As it was going, the steamroller was on. And our job was just to be rolled up under the steamroller. And that’s what they expected. I wouldn’t be able to live [with that] anymore, and nobody here would. It wasn’t just me. It’s literally almost the whole company feels like that. And yes, we understand the technology a lot more and so we see, we understand technically this thing deeply. We ward off attacks every day and so we have a working knowledge of the cyber landscape. That probably makes us more ultra sensitive to it. And we’re also believers in civil liberties. To me this is a part of the foundation of what America is. Right to privacy is really important. You pull that brick out and another and pretty soon the house falls.

It is early morning in Alahalli village in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, but the heat and humidity are rising fast. As Chandrika scrolls, she clicks on several audio clips in succession, demonstrating the simplicity of the app she recently started using. At each tap, the sound of her voice speaking her mother tongue emerges from the phone. Before she started using this app, 30-year-old Chandrika (who, like many South Indians, uses the first letter of her father's name, K., instead of a last name) had just 184 rupees ($2.25) in her bank account. But in return for around six hours of work spread over several days in late April, she received 2,570 rupees ($31.30). That’s roughly the same amount she makes in a month of working as a teacher at a distant school, after the cost of the three buses it takes her to get there and back. Unlike her day job, the app doesn’t make her wait until the end of the month for payment; money lands in her bank account in just a few hours. Just by reading text aloud in her native language of Kannada, spoken by around 60 million people mostly in central and southern India, Chandrika has used this app to earn an hourly wage of about $5, nearly 20 times the Indian minimum. And in a few days, more money will arrive—a 50% bonus, awarded once the voice clips are validated as accurate. Read More: Gig Workers Behind AI Face ‘Unfair Working Conditions,’ Oxford Report Finds Chandrika’s voice can fetch this sum because of the boom in artificial intelligence (AI). Right now, cutting edge AIs—for example, large language models like ChatGPT—work best in languages like English, where text and audio data is abundant online. They work much less well in languages like Kannada which, even though it is spoken by millions of people, is scarce on the internet. (Wikipedia has 6 million articles in English, for example, but only 30,000 in Kannada.) When they function at all, AIs in these “lower resourced” languages can be biased—by regularly assuming that doctors are men and nurses women, for example—and can struggle to understand local dialects. To create an effective English-speaking AI, it is enough to simply collect data from where it has already accumulated. But for languages like Kannada, you need to go out and find more.  This has created huge demand for datasets—collections of text or voice data—in languages spoken by some of the poorest people in the world. Part of that demand comes from tech companies seeking to build out their AI tools. Another big chunk comes from academia and governments, especially in India, where English and Hindi have long held outsize precedence in a nation of some 1.4 billion people with 22 official languages and at least 780 more indigenous ones. This rising demand means that hundreds of millions of Indians are suddenly in control of a scarce and newly-valuable asset: their mother tongue. Data work—creating or refining the raw material at the heart of AI— is not new in India. The economy that did so much to turn call centers and garment factories into engines of productivity at the end of the 20th century has quietly been doing the same with data work in the 21st. And, like its predecessors, the industry is once again dominated by labor arbitrage companies, which pay wages close to the legal minimum even as they sell data to foreign clients for a hefty mark-up. The AI data sector, worth over $2 billion globally in 2022, is projected to rise in value to $17 billion by 2030. Little of that money has flowed down to data workers in India, Kenya, and the Philippines. These conditions may cause harms far beyond the lives of individual workers. “We’re talking about systems that are impacting our whole society, and workers who make those systems more reliable and less biased,” says Jonas Valente, an expert in digital work platforms at Oxford University’s Internet Institute. “If you have workers with basic rights who are more empowered, I believe that the outcome—the technological system—will have a better quality as well.” In the neighboring villages of Alahalli and Chilukavadi, one Indian startup is testing a new model. Chandrika works for Karya, a nonprofit launched in 2021 in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) that bills itself as “the world’s first ethical data company.” Like its competitors, it sells data to big tech companies and other clients at the market rate. But instead of keeping much of that cash as profit, it covers its costs and funnels the rest toward the rural poor in India. (Karya partners with local NGOs to ensure access to its jobs go first to the poorest of the poor, as well as historically marginalized communities.) In addition to its $5 hourly minimum, Karya gives workers de-facto ownership of the data they create on the job, so whenever it is resold, the workers receive the proceeds on top of their past wages. It’s a model that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the industry.  “The wages that exist right now are a failure of the market,” Manu Chopra, the 27-year-old CEO of Karya, tells me. “We decided to be a nonprofit because fundamentally, you can’t solve a market failure in the market.” The work Karya is doing also means that millions of people whose languages are marginalized online could stand to gain better access to the benefits of technology—including AI. “Most people in the villages don’t know English,” says Vinutha, a 23-year-old student who has used Karya to reduce her financial reliance on her parents. “If a computer could understand Kannada, that would be very helpful.” Read More: 150 African Workers for ChatGPT, TikTok and Facebook Vote to Unionize at Landmark Nairobi Meeting The catch, if you can call it that, is that the work is supplementary. The first thing Karya tells its workers is: This is not a permanent job, but rather a way to quickly get an income boost that will allow you to go on and do other things. The maximum a worker can earn through the app is the equivalent of $1,500, roughly the average annual income in India. After that point, they make way for somebody else. Karya says it has paid out 65 million rupees (nearly $800,000) in wages to some 30,000 rural Indians up and down the country. By 2030, Chopra wants it to reach 100 million people. “I genuinely feel this is the quickest way to move millions of people out of poverty if done right,” says Chopra, who was born into poverty and won a scholarship to Stanford that changed his trajectory. “This is absolutely a social project. Wealth is power. And we want to redistribute wealth to the communities who have been left behind.” Chopra isn’t the first tech founder to rhapsodize about the potential of AI data work to benefit the world’s poorest. Sama, an outsourcing company that has handled contracts for OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s Facebook, also marketed itself as an “ethical” way for tech companies to lift people in the Global South out of poverty. But as I reported in January, many of its ChatGPT workers in Kenya—some earning less than $2 per hour—told me they were exposed to training data that left them traumatized. The company also performed similar content moderation work for Facebook; one worker on that project told me he was fired when he campaigned for better working conditions. When asked by the BBC about low wages in 2018, Sama’s late founder argued that paying workers higher wages could disrupt local economies, causing more harm than good. Many of the data workers I’ve spoken to while reporting on this industry for the past 18 months have bristled at this logic, saying it’s a convenient narrative for companies that are getting rich off the proceeds of their labor.  Read More: OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less Toxic There is another way, Chopra argues. “The biggest lesson I have learned over the last 5 years is that all of this is possible,” he wrote in a series of tweets in response to my January article on ChatGPT. “This is not some dream for a fictional better world. We can pay our workers 20 times the minimum wage, and still be a sustainable organization.”  It was the first I’d heard of Karya, and my immediate instinct was skepticism. Sama too had begun its life as a nonprofit focused on poverty eradication, only to transition later to a for-profit business. Could Karya really be a model for a more inclusive and ethical AI industry? Even if it were, could it scale? One thing was clear: there could be few better testing grounds for these questions than India—a country where mobile data is among the cheapest in the world, and where it is common for even poor rural villagers to have access to both a smartphone and a bank account. Then there is the potential upside: even before the pandemic some 140 million people in India survived on under $2.15 per day, according to the World Bank. For those people, cash injections of the magnitude Chopra was talking about could be life-changing. Just 70 miles from the bustling tech metropolis of Bengaluru, past sugarcane fields and under the bright orange arcs of blossoming gulmohar trees, is the village of Chilukavadi. Inside a low concrete building, the headquarters of a local farming cooperative, a dozen men and women are gathered—all of whom have started working for Karya within the past week.  Kanakaraj S., a skinny 21-year-old, sits cross-legged on the cool concrete floor. He is studying at a nearby college, and to pay for books and transport costs he occasionally works as a casual laborer in the surrounding fields. A day’s work can earn him 350 rupees (around $4) but this kind of manual labor is becoming more unbearable as climate change makes summers here even more sweltering than usual. Working in a factory in a nearby city would mean a slightly higher wage, but means hours of daily commuting on unreliable and expensive buses or, worse, moving away from his support network to live in dormitory accommodation in the city.  At Karya, Kanakaraj can earn more in an hour than he makes in a day in the fields. “The work is good,” he says. “And easy.” Chopra says that’s a typical refrain when he meets villagers. “They’re happy we pay them well,” he says, but more importantly, “it’s that it’s not hard work. It’s not physical work.”   Kanakaraj was surprised when he saw the first payment land in his bank account. “We’ve lost a lot of money from scams,” he tells me, explaining that it is common for villagers to receive SMS texts preying on their desperation, offering to multiply any deposits they make by 10. When somebody first told him about Karya he assumed it was a similar con—a common initial response, according to Chopra. Read More: Big Tech Layoffs Are Hurting Workers Far Beyond Silicon Valley With so little in savings, local people often find themselves taking out loans to cover emergency costs. Predatory agencies tend to charge high interest rates on these loans, leaving some villagers here trapped in cycles of debt. Chandrika, for example, will use some of her Karya wages to help her family pay off a large medical loan incurred when her 25-year-old sister fell ill with low blood pressure. Despite the medical treatment, her sister died, leaving the family responsible for both an infant and a mountain of debt. “We can figure out how to repay the loan,” says Chandrika, a tear rolling down her cheek. “But we can’t bring back my sister.” Other Karya workers find themselves in similar situations. Ajay Kumar, 25, is drowning in medical debt taken out to address his mother’s severe back injury. And Shivanna N., 38, lost his right hand in a firecracker accident as a boy. While he doesn’t have debt, his disability means he struggles to make a living. The work these villagers are doing is part of a new project that Karya is rolling out across the state of Karnataka for an Indian healthcare NGO seeking speech data about tuberculosis—a mostly curable and preventable disease that still kills around 200,000 Indians every year. The voice recordings, collected in 10 different dialects of Kannada, will help train an AI speech model to understand local people’s questions about tuberculosis, and respond with information aimed at reducing the spread of the disease. The hope is that the app, when completed, will make it easier for illiterate people to access reliable information, without shouldering the stigma that tuberculosis patients—victims of a contagious disease—often attract when they seek help in small communities. The recordings will also go up for sale on Karya’s platform as part of its Kannada dataset, on offer to the many AI companies that care less about the contents of their training data than what it encodes about the overall structure of the language. Every time it’s resold, 100% of the revenue will be distributed to the Karya workers who contributed to the dataset, apportioned by the hours they put in. Rajamma M., a 30-year-old woman from a nearby village, previously worked as a COVID-19 surveyor for the government, going from door to door checking if people had been vaccinated. But the work dried up in January. The money from working for Karya, she says, has been welcome—but more than that, she has appreciated the opportunity to learn. “This work has given me greater awareness about tuberculosis and how people should take their medicine,” she says. “This will be helpful for my job in the future.”  Although small, Karya already has a list of high-profile clients including Microsoft, MIT, and Stanford. In February, it began work on a new project for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to build voice datasets in five languages spoken by some 1 billion Indians—Marathi, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali, and Malayalam. The end goal is to build a chatbot that can answer rural Indians’ questions, in their native languages and dialects, about health care, agriculture, sanitation, banking, and career development. This technology (think of it as a ChatGPT for poverty eradication) could help share the knowledge needed to improve quality of life across vast swaths of the subcontinent.  “I think there should be a world where language is no longer a barrier to technology—so everyone can use technology irrespective of the language they speak,” says Kalika Bali, a linguist and principal researcher at Microsoft Research who is working with the Gates Foundation on the project and is an unpaid member of Karya’s oversight board. She has specifically designed the prompts workers are given to read aloud to mitigate the gender biases that often creep into datasets and thus help to avoid the “doctor” and “nurse” problem. But it’s not just about the prompts. Karya’s relatively high wages “percolate down to the quality of the data,” Bali says. “It will immediately result in better accuracy of the system’s output.” She says she typically receives data with a less than 1% error rate from Karya, “which is almost never the case with data that we build [AI] models with.”  Over the course of several days together, Chopra tells me a version of his life story that makes his path toward Karya feel simultaneously impossible and inevitable. He was born in 1996 in a basti, an informal settlement, next to a railway line in Delhi. His grandparents had arrived there as refugees from Pakistan during the partition of British India in 1947, and there the family had remained for two generations. Although his parents were well-educated, he says, they sometimes struggled to put food on the table. He could tell when his father, who ran a small factory making train parts, had had a good day at work because dinner would be the relatively expensive Maggi instant ramen, not cheap lentil dal. Every monsoon the basti’s gutters would flood, and his family would have to move in with his grandmother nearby for a few days. “I think all of us have a keen recognition of the idea that money is a cushion from reality,” Chopra says of the Karya team. “Our goal is to give that cushion to as many people as possible.” Chopra excelled at the basti’s local school, which was run by an NGO. When he was in ninth grade he won a scholarship to a private school in Delhi, which was running a competition to give places to kids from poor backgrounds. Though he was bullied, he acknowledges that certain privileges helped open doors for him. “As difficult as my journey was, it was significantly easier than most people’s in India,” he says, “because I was born to two educated parents in an upper-caste family in a major city.” When Chopra was 17, a woman was fatally gang-raped on a bus in Delhi, a crime that shocked India and the world. Chopra, who was discovering a love for computer science at the time and idolized Steve Jobs, set to work. He built a wristwatch-style “anti-molestation device,” which could detect an elevated heart rate and administer a weak electric shock to an attacker, with the intent to allow the victim time to escape. The device grabbed the attention of the media and India’s former President, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who encouraged Chopra to apply for a scholarship at Stanford. (The only thing Chopra knew about Stanford at the time, he recalls, is that Jobs studied there. Later he discovered even that wasn’t true.) Only later did Chopra realize the naivety of trying to solve the problem of endemic sexual violence with a gadget. “Technologists are very prone to seeing a problem and building to solve it,” he says. “It’s hard to critique an 11th grade kid, but it was a very technical solution.” As he tells it, his arrival in California was a culture shock in more ways than one. On his first night, Chopra says, each student in his dorm explained how they planned to make their first billion dollars. Somebody suggested building “Snapchat for puppies,” he recalls. Everyone there aspired to be a billionaire, he realized, except him. “Very early at Stanford, I felt alone, like I was in the wrong place,” Chopra says. Still, he had come to college as a “techno-utopian,” he says. That gradually fell away as he learned in class about how IBM had built systems to support Apartheid in South Africa, and other ways technology companies had hurt the world by chasing profit alone.   Returning to India after college, Chopra joined Microsoft Research, a subsidiary of the big tech company that gives researchers a long leash to work on difficult social problems. With his colleague Vivek Seshadri, he set out to research whether it would be possible to channel money to rural Indians using digital work. One of Chopra’s first field visits was to a center operated by an AI data company in Mumbai. The room was hot and dirty, he recalls, and full of men hunched over laptops doing image annotation work. When he asked them how much they were earning, they told him they made 30 rupees per hour, or just under $0.40. He didn’t have the heart to tell them the going rate for the data they were annotating was, conservatively, 10 times that amount. “I thought, this cannot be the only way this work can happen,” he says.  Chopra and Seshadri worked on the idea for four years at Microsoft Research, doing field studies and building a prototype app. They discovered an “overwhelming enthusiasm” for the work among India’s rural poor, according to a paper they published with four colleagues in 2019. The research confirmed Chopra and Seshadri’s suspicions that the work could be done to to a high standard of accuracy even with no training, from a smartphone rather than a physical office, and without workers needing the ability to speak English – thus making it possible to reach not just city-dwellers but the poorest of the poor in rural India. In 2021 Chopra and Seshadri, with a grant from Microsoft Research, quit their jobs to spin Karya out as an independent nonprofit, joined by a third cofounder, Safiya Husain. (Microsoft holds no equity in Karya.)  Unlike many Silicon Valley rags-to-riches stories, Chopra’s trajectory, in his telling, wasn’t a result of his own hard work. “I got lucky 100 times in a row,” he says. “I’m a product of irrational compassion from nonprofits, from schools, from the government—all of these places that are supposed to help everyone, but they don’t. When I have received so much compassion, the least I can do is give back.” Not everybody is eligible to work for Karya. Chopra says that initially he and his team opened the app up to anybody, only to realize the first hundred sign-ups were all men from a dominant-caste community. The experience taught him that “knowledge flows through the channels of power,” Chopra says. To reach the poorest communities—and marginalized castes, genders, and religions—Chopra learned early on that he had to team up with nonprofits with a grassroots presence in rural areas. Those organizations could distribute access codes on Karya’s behalf in line with income and diversity requirements. “They know for whom that money is nice to have, and for whom it is life-changing,” he says. This process also ensures more diversity in the data that workers end up generating, which can help to minimize AI bias.  Chopra defines this approach using a Hindi word—thairaav—a term from Indian classical music which he translates as a mixture between “pause” and “thoughtful impact.” It’s a concept, he says, that is missing not only from the English language, but also from the business philosophies of Silicon Valley tech companies, who often put scale and speed above all else. Thairaav, to him, means that “at every step, you are pausing and thinking: Am I doing the right thing? Is this right for the community I’m trying to serve?” That kind of thoughtfulness “is just missing from a lot of entrepreneurial ‘move fast and break things’ behavior,” he says.  It’s an approach that has led Karya to flatly reject four offers so far from prospective clients to do content moderation that would require workers to view traumatizing material.  It’s compelling. But it’s also coming from a guy who says he wants to scale his app to reach 100 million Indians by 2030. Doesn’t Karya’s reliance on grassroots NGOs to onboard every new worker mean it faces a significant bottleneck? Actually, Chopra tells me, the limiting factor to Karya’s expansion isn’t finding new workers. There are millions who will jump at the chance to earn its high wages, and Karya has built a vetted network of more than 200 grassroots NGOs to onboard them. The bottleneck is the amount of available work. “What we need is large-scale awareness that most data companies are unethical,” he says, “and that there is an ethical way.” For the app to have the impact Chopra believes it can, he needs to win more clients—to persuade more tech companies, governments, and academic institutions to get their AI training data from Karya.  But it’s often in the pursuit of new clients that even companies that pride themselves on ethics can end up compromising. What’s to stop Karya doing the same? Part of the answer, Chopra says, lies in Karya’s corporate structure. Karya is registered as a nonprofit in the U.S. that controls two entities in India: one nonprofit and one for-profit. The for-profit is legally bound to donate any profits it makes (after reimbursing workers) to the nonprofit, which reinvests them. The convoluted structure, Chopra says, is because Indian law prevents nonprofits from making any more than 20% of their income from the market as opposed to philanthropic donations. Karya does take grant funding—crucially, it covers the salaries of all 24 of its full-time employees—but not enough to have an entirely nonprofit model be possible. The arrangement, Chopra says, has the benefit of removing any incentive for him or his co-founders to compromise on worker salaries or well-being in return for lucrative contracts.  It’s a model that works for the moment, but could collapse if philanthropic funding dries up. “Karya is very young, and they have got a lot of good traction,” says Subhashree Dutta, a managing partner at The/Nudge Institute, an incubator that has supported Karya with a $20,000 grant. “They have the ability to stay true to their values and still attract capital. But I don’t think they have been significantly exposed to the dilemmas of taking the for-profit or not-for-profit stance.” Over the course of two days with Karya workers in southern Karnataka, the limitations of Karya’s current system begin to come into focus. Each worker says they have completed 1,287 tasks on the app—the maximum, at the point of my visit, of the number of tasks available on the tuberculosis project. It equates to about six hours of work. The money workers can receive (just under $50 after bonuses for accuracy) is a welcome boost but won’t last long. On my trip I don’t meet any workers who have received royalties. Chopra tells me that Karya has only just amassed enough resellable data to be attractive to buyers; it has so far distributed $116,000 in royalties to around 4,000 workers, but the ones I've met are too early into their work to be among them. I put to Chopra that it will still take much more to have a meaningful impact on these villagers’ lives. The tuberculosis project is only the beginning for these workers, he replies. They are lined up to shortly begin work on transcription tasks—part of a push by the Indian government to build AI models in several regional languages including Kannada. That, he says, will allow Karya to give “significantly more” work to the villagers in Chilukavadi. Still, the workers are a long way from the $1,500 that would mark their graduation from Karya’s system. Eventually, Chopra acknowledges that not a single one of Karya’s 30,000 workers has reached the $1,500 threshold. Yet their enjoyment of the work, and their desire for more, is clear: when Seshadri, now Karya’s chief technology officer, asks the room full of workers whether they would feel capable of a new task flagging inaccuracies in Kannada sentences, they erupt in excited chatter: a unanimous yes. The villagers I speak to in Chilukavadi and Alahalli have only a limited understanding of artificial intelligence. Chopra says this can be a challenge when explaining to workers what they’re doing. The most successful approach his team has found is telling workers they are “teaching the computer to speak Kannada,” he says. Nobody here knows of ChatGPT, but villagers do know that Google Assistant (which they refer to as “OK Google”) works better when you prompt it in English than in their mother tongue. Siddaraju L., a 35-year-old unemployed father of three, says he doesn’t know what AI is, but would feel proud if a computer could speak his language. “The same respect I have for my parents, I have for my mother tongue.” Just as India was able to leapfrog the rest of the world on 4G because it was unencumbered by existing mobile data infrastructure, the hope is that efforts like the ones Karya is enabling will help Indian-language AI projects learn from the mistakes of English AIs and begin from a far more reliable and unbiased starting point. “Until not so long ago, a speech-recognition engine for English would not even understand my English,” says Bali, the speech researcher, referring to her accent. “What is the point of AI technologies being out there if they do not cater to the users they are targeting?” Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com.", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/6296196/ai-data-gig-workers/", "https://time.com/6255952/ai-impact-chatgpt-microsoft-google/", "https://time.com/6263022/what-to-know-about-chatgpt-4/", "https://time.com/6248790/india-population-data-china/", "https://time.com/collection-post/6289603/whitney-wolfe-herd-interview-person-of-the-week/", "https://time.com/6275995/chatgpt-facebook-african-workers-union/", "https://time.com/6292470/sovereign-debt-china-belt-road/", "https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/", "https://time.com/6147458/facebook-africa-content-moderation-employee-treatment/", "https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/", "https://time.com/6280372/sam-altman-chatgpt-regulate-ai/", "https://time.com/5880585/india-coronavirus-impact/", "https://time.com/6234014/tech-layoffs-twitter-amazon-global-workers/", "https://time.com/6295511/how-an-innovative-deal-will-give-millions-access-to-cheaper-tuberculosis-drugs/", "https://time.com/6045836/india-covid-19-healthcare-workers-asha/", "https://time.com/6267654/ai-track-coughing-health/", "https://time.com/5754565/india-rape-new-delhi-bus-attack/", "https://time.com/6156124/india-hindu-muslim-caste/", "https://time.com/6234014/tech-layoffs-twitter-amazon-global-workers/", "https://time.com/6278179/satya-nadella-ai-concerns/"], "sentiment_score": 0.09772221651920901, "subjectivity_score": 0.4151167198159681},

Here’s what we know so far: Apple announced on August 31 that it is planning an event for September 12, where the company is set to announce new iPhones and more. Apple is expected to announce a special 10th anniversary edition iPhone with an edge-to-edge screen and facial recognition technology, both the Journal and Bloomberg  have reported. This new model may cost around $1,000, according to separate reports from the New York Times and Fast Company. Some have speculated that it will be called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X. With its 10th anniversary iPhone, Apple is partly playing a game of catchup with its Android rivals. Recently released Android phones such as Samsung’s Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 and Android co-creator Andy Rubin’s Essential Phone already feature an edge-to-edge screen. Samsung’s newer phones also support facial recognition and wireless charging, both of which Apple is expected to add to the 10th anniversary iPhone. Apple may also debut two other new iPhones that are more modest updates to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Besides new smartphones, it’s rumored that Apple will introduce a revamped Apple TV that supports 4K streaming and a refreshed Apple Watch.

{"type": "article", "header": "What Will Apple’s New iPhone Be Called? We Rounded Up the Possible Names", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "September 5, 2017 3:16 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4927440/iphone-8-edition-names/?iid=sr-link1", "text": "While Apple has kept understandably quiet about its next iPhones, incessant leaks have painted a picture of what we can expect: a new design with an OLED screen that dominates the phone’s front, a 3D sensor for facial recognition and the removal of the home button are all part of Apple’s next major iPhone, according to multiple reports. But one piece of information that’s been less consistently bandied by rumormongers is what, precisely, Apple plans to call its next-gen smartphones. On September 12, the company is widely expected to debut three new iPhones: a 10-year anniversary edition iPhone that will incorporate the changes mentioned above, and two new models that update the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models. Here’s what we know so far about what these new phones might be called. If Apple follows the naming convention it’s established in recent years, updated versions of Apple’s current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be called the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Since the iPhone 4s launched in 2011, Apple has tick-tocked between giving its new smartphones a name with a single whole number and a name with the letter “s” tagged on every other year. These “s” generation iPhones typically include new technologies while maintaining the same form factor as their predecessors: the iPhone 4s looked just like the iPhone 4 but introduced Siri, for instance. Similarly, the iPhone 5s was the same size and shape as the iPhone 5, but was the first to have Touch ID. As this is a “tock” year, rumors suggest these new iPhones will run on the same processor as Apple’s 10th anniversary edition iPhone, but it’s unclear if they’ll land any of the high-end model’s other bells and whistles. If Apple does release an iPhone 7s and 7s Plus next month, similar logic — calibrated for this being the iPhone’s celebratory 10th anniversary — suggests that a rumored premium model will be called the iPhone 8. This would follow from Apple’s history of revamping the iPhone’s form factor with each singular whole number generation. But a recent report from 9to5Mac suggests the rumor mill may have this one wrong. Instead of adding an ‘s’ to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus’ successors, Apple may instead call them the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, says this report, which cites insider information obtained from third-party iPhone case makers. If true, it means that Apple views these phones as sufficiently advanced to brand them as next-generational, not just iterative updates to the current models. If the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus’ successors are in fact to be an iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, where does that leave the rumored premium edition iPhone? According to the same 9to5Mac report, Apple plans to name its 10th anniversary smartphone the iPhone Edition. This isn’t the first time someone’s suggested as much: back in March, Japanese blog Macotakara reported the same. Another rumored possible name for Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone is simply iPhone X, where the “X” stands for the Roman numeral, pronounced “ten” just as when you say “OS X.” Longtime Apple analyst and Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster believes Apple will choose this name, skipping ‘9’ to ring in the iPhone’s 10th anniversary. VentureBeat’s Evan Blass, who has a steady track record reporting on unreleased smartphones, also said he’s heard iPhone X as a possible name for Apple’s high-end iPhone. Prominent Apple blogger John Gruber suspects that Apple could call the special edition iPhone the iPhone Pro or iPhone 8 Pro. If so, the title would fit with the nomenclature Apple uses for its other premium products, the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. It would thus convey the notion that the company’s 10th anniversary iPhone is more for power users rather than mainstream smartphone shoppers.

The confirmation of the event comes after the Wall Street Journal and others had reported Apple would hold its event on that date. In addition to a new and ostensibly reimagined flagship iPhone, Apple is expected to introduce updated versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (presumably called the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus) as well as an updated Apple TV set-top box, and a new version of its Apple Watch that may include built-in cellular support. The new iPhone, expected to be called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X, will include numerous changes that set it apart from its predecessors: an overhauled design with a larger display that cover nearly all of the phone’s face, cutting-edge OLED screen technology for a sharper and more vivid image, facial recognition and the ability to charge without being tethered by a power cable. The so-called iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are more likely to offer modest improvements without major design changes, such new processors, more memory and tweaks to other subsystems like the camera and wireless chip. The new Apple Watch, meanwhile, could offer the ability to connect to cellular networks and better battery life, while the biggest improvement coming to the new Apple TV is expected to be support for 4K video playback. Apple typically releases its new iPhones roughly a week or two after introducing them. Last year, for example, it debuted the iPhone 7 on September 7, and the gadgets hit stores on September 16. The year prior, it unveiled the iPhone 6s on September 9 and launched them in stores on September 25.

But the company did have at least one surprise up its sleeve (no, not One Republic): Apple will be selling its new phones directly to customers via a monthly payment plan. The new initiative, called the iPhone Upgrade Program, will allow customers to finance the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus in monthly installments, starting at $32 per month, and upgrade to the newest iPhone for no extra charge each year. The phones will be unlocked, meaning customers can choose a wireless carrier at will. The phones also come with AppleCare+, Apple’s extended warranty and technical support program.  The program essentially does away with the traditional two-year contract, through which customers buy carrier-subsidized phones in exchange for getting locked into 24 months of service. That’s been the model for selling cell phones in the United States for years, and it’s been hugely beneficial for Apple. Each new iPhone is a cutting-edge piece of technology that typically retails for $650 minimum. But two-year contracts obscure that expense by letting customers pay $200 or less upfront for the phones. The additional cost is lumped in with the cost of monthly phone service, leaving many customers none the wiser. But that model has been under threat in recent years. T-Mobile, through its disruptive “Uncarrier” campaign, unbundled the cost of a cell phone from the cost of phone service back in 2013. In August, Verizon also eliminated two-year contracts for new customers, while AT&T and Sprint offer either traditional contracts or leasing plans. And other phone manufacturers have gotten in on the action as well, with Motorola selling an unlocked versinon of its newest Moto X phone on its website in monthly installments.  Given these rapid changes in the market, Apple had no choice but to come up with its own payment plan. The company has to keep people thinking of the iPhone as an essential but affordable device that they’ll want to upgrade every two years at the latest. Monthly payments don’t do as good a job of obscuring a phone’s true cost as a two-year contract, but it’s better than making people pay $650 or more outright. People upgrade tablets and PCs much less often than they upgrade their phones, likely because those gadgets cost hundreds of dollars upfront.  Overall, Apple’s program will require customers to spend $384 per year, at minimum, on their phones. For frequent upgraders, that could be a good deal. But if you’re content with getting a new iPhone every two years, the math doesn’t add up as well. It’s also possible that certain carriers with plans aimed at frequent upgraders, like T-Mobile‘s Jump program, will have more competitive pricing. If you needed any more proof that the two-year contract is soon to be dead, Apple’s splashy event was another nail in its coffin.

The new model will have a refreshed water-resistant design without a headphone jack, a force-sensitive home button, and a new glossy finish. The larger iPhone 7 Plus model also features two separate camera lenses. The iPhone 7 will start at $649 while the iPhone 7 Plus will be available from $749. Both phones will come in 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB options, with Apple notably cutting the 16GB storage option. Pre-orders begin on Sept. 9 and the phone will begin shipping on Sept. 16. Apple’s iPhone 7 will be available in two new finishes: black and jet black, the latter of which has a glossy look. Apple has also made the antenna on the back of the phone less visible to create a more seamless aesthetic. Apple will also be releasing a new version of its EarPod earbuds that connect to the new iPhone via the Lightning connector. These new EarPods and a dongle for connecting older headphones to the iPhone 7 will be included along with the new iPhone. The new camera system in the iPhone 7 will allow 50% more light to hit the sensor. The 12-megapixel sensor is also said to be faster and more efficient, and both models will include optical image stabilization. Apple calls this new camera system a “supercomputer” for photos: the iPhone 7’s new image signal processor can use machine learning to read the scene and adjust accordingly, the company says. The iPhone 7 Plus’ dual lens setup includes a wide angle lens and telephoto lens, which will allow it to capture high quality images even while zooming, Apple says. Thanks to a combination of the telephoto lens and the iPhone 7 Plus’ software, owners should be able to shoot sharp photos with up to a 10x zoom, according to Apple. The new processor that powers the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, called the A10 Fusion, is said to be 40% faster than the A9 chip in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. It’s also twice as fast as the processor inside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Apple says that tools like the mobile version of Adobe’s Lightroom software will be able to run smoothly on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus thanks to this new processor. The new iPhones are also said to have longer lasting batteries than any other iPhone, offering up to two hours of extra mileage compared to last year’s model. Apple has made improvements to the screens on its new iPhones as well. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are said to have screens that are 25% brighter than that of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.

{"type": "article", "header": "iPhone 8 Release Date: Everything We Know About Apple’s New iPhone", "author": "Matt Peckham", "update_date/publish_date": "September 8, 2017 10:25 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4919052/iphone-8-release-date/", "text": "Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone, possibly called the iPhone 8, iPhone X or iPhone Edition, is expected to be announced at the company’s big event on September 12. But when is the release date for the company’s ostensibly next-gen iPhone? When will buyers be able to place an order for one? When can they lay hands on the device itself? We won’t know for sure until Apple provides that info, presumably when it unveils the new phone next week. But we can do some educated guessing based on the release trajectories that followed events in prior years. Here’s everything we know about the so-called iPhone 8’s release timeframe so far: If Apple announces its next-gen iPhone on Tuesday, September 12 as expected, the new phone could be available to preorder as early as Friday, September 15. Last year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were announced on September 7 at an event in San Francisco, and preorders began at 3:01 a.m. ET on September 9 in the U.S. But reports of summer manufacturing delays have prompted speculation that Apple’s next-gen iPhone will be available in only limited quantities. If accurate, and the new phone is made available to preorder on September 15, it could instantly sell out and be even harder to find than Nintendo’s similarly scarce Switch games console. But Apple’s own September-quarter earnings forecast, issued in early August, has thrown water on some of these worries, suggesting the company doesn’t expect to have availability problems. Apple is also said to be planning updated versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, possibly dubbed iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, or alternately iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Those phones would likely be available to order in the traditional timeframe: the Friday following the event, September 15. NEXT: iPhone 8 Specs: Everything We Know About Apple’s Next Big Phone Apple has made September its new iPhone launch month annually since it rolled out the iPhone 5 back in 2012. As noted, last year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were announced on September 7, with preorders following on September 9. The new phones were then released (in stores and to mail orders) a week later on Friday, September 16. If Apple follows suit this year, releasing its next iPhone a week or so after unveiling it, the iPhone 8 should appear in stores by September 22. That’s what self-styled Twitter “mobile reporter” Benjamin Geskin claims, anyway, writing that U.K. telecommunications provider O2 has told its staff that the iPhone 8’s release date in stores is indeed September 22. O2 have confirmed to staff members that iPhone 8 release date is 22nd September in stores. pic.twitter.com/n1dfWl2S66 Note that if demand is sky-high, whether availability turns out to be limited or not, it’s entirely possible many could wind up waiting for months — even into 2018 — to lay hands on Apple’s next-gen iPhone. With all the new features expected in Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone, including an edge-to-edge screen (which may forego a Home button entirely) and face recognition technology, it’s probably no surprise that both the New York Times and Fast Company are reporting the iPhone 8 could cost in the vicinity of $1,000. That would be considerably more than prior new iPhones, and could offset some of the uptake mania (as well as backorder queues) by driving impatient buyers to settle for the presumably less expensive (and more readily available) followups to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

Elevated mortgage rates and high home prices can make it feel like buying your first home is out of reach, but these programs can help.  Three of the main barriers to homeownership are down payments, credit access and affordability, according to a 2018 report from the Urban Institute. First-time homebuyer programs are designed to help you overcome these obstacles and unlock the long-term benefits of owning a home.  “The biggest challenge that first-time homebuyers face right now is the belief that they can’t purchase right now. You’ll see more individuals staying on the sideline, versus taking that first step of determining if they actually can purchase,” said Derrick Nutall, vice president of Citi mortgage’s community lending team.  Understanding all of the home loan options available to you and comparing different mortgage programs will help you better decide if now is the right time to buy your first home. Here are eight of the best mortgage options to consider as you embark on the process of buying your first home.  The cost of buying your first home can seem overwhelming -- not to mention expensive. But there are several government-sponsored or private programs available to help with your down payment and closing costs. Each state offers some form of assistance to first-time homebuyers. These programs commonly offer the following:  Even if you’ve owned a home before, you may qualify as a first-time homebuyer. Many programs consider you a first-time homebuyer if you haven’t owned a home in the last three years. This distinction can make a significant difference for previous homeowners looking to reenter the housing market. FHA loans are fixed-rate mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration and are considered more secure than conventional loans because they are backed by the US government. They’re one of the easiest mortgages to get approved for if you’re a first-time homebuyer with a low credit score and minimal down payment savings. FHA loans offer 3.5% down payment options for those with credit scores of 580 or above. If you have a credit score between 500 and 579, you can still get approved for an FHA loan, but will be required to make a 10% down payment. You’ll need a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less and a steady employment history to qualify. An FHA loan also requires a private mortgage insurance premium, or MIP. You’ll pay 1.75% of the loan amount upfront for MIP, and the annual cost can vary between 0.45% to 1.05% of your home loan amount, depending on your down payment and amount of financing. You cannot cancel FHA mortgage insurance for FHA loans initiated after 2013 unless you put at least 10% down. In this case, your mortgage insurance can be canceled after 11 years. If your down payment was less, MIP will be canceled once your entire mortgage is repaid. To qualify, you must be a first-time homebuyer or have not been a homeowner in three years. To be eligible for a VA loan you must be an active or retired member of the US military or the spouse of one. If you qualify, you can take advantage of a mortgage with no down payment or private mortgage insurance requirements. VA loans are backed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs and are issued by private lenders. Although VA loans offer down payment benefits, you will need to pay an origination fee between 1.4% and 2.3%, which can typically be rolled into the loan amount.  To qualify for a VA loan, you need to provide a Certificate of Eligibility and have verifiable income. There is no minimum credit score as the minimum required score varies by lender, but many lenders like to see a credit score of at least 640 or higher. USDA loans are 30-year fixed mortgages backed by the US Department of Agriculture for low- to moderate-income homebuyers in rural areas. And you might qualify even if you live near the city or in a suburb -- approximately 97% of land in the US is eligible for a USDA loan. This home loan offers 100% loan financing, so it does not require a down payment. USDA loans do not require private mortgage insurance but have a 1% upfront funding fee due at the time of closing and a 0.35% annual fee that will be built into your monthly mortgage payments. Unlike other mortgage insurance, funding fees on USDA loans cannot be canceled once you reach 20% equity.  You’ll typically need a 640 credit score or higher to qualify, but requirements vary by lender. The Fannie Mae conventional mortgage is one of the most common types of mortgages in the US, offering 15-year and 30-year fixed mortgages. As a conventional loan, this mortgage type is not backed by the US government and is instead backed by banks and lenders. A conventional mortgage allows you to put as little as 3% down. You’ll also need to purchase private mortgage insurance if you put less than 20% down. You can cancel your mortgage insurance once you reach 20% equity in your home. You need a credit score of at least 620 for fixed-rate and 640 for adjustable-rate mortgages to qualify. Keep in mind the conventional loan limit for a single unit in the US is $726,200. A more expensive home would require a different type of home loan, known as a jumbo loan. This conventional loan is also not backed by the federal government but offers benefits for first-time homebuyers. The Freddie Mac Home Possible loan program only requires a 3% down payment but does require a minimum credit score of 660 for a fixed-rate mortgage. To qualify, your home must be located in an underserved area or your income must be no greater than 80% of the median income for that area. PMI is required if your down payment is under 20%. This can be canceled when you reach 20% equity in your home. The HomeReady mortgage program is similar to the Freddie Mac Home Possible program, but it’s slightly easier to qualify for if you have a lower credit score. The HomeReady Mortgage program requires only 3% down and a minimum credit score of 620. You will also have to complete a homeownership education course. Unlike the FHA loan, this program does not place geographical restrictions on mortgage limits. You can also use grants and gifts from nonprofit organizations, churches or family members to help fund your down payment, and no minimum personal funds are required. You’ll also need to purchase PMI if your down payment is under 20%, but you can cancel your mortgage insurance once you reach 20% equity in your home. The Good Neighbor Next Door mortgage program incentivizes primary and secondary school teachers (from pre-K through 12th grade), law enforcement officers, emergency medical technicians and firefighters with a 50% discount on a property’s listed price. This program offers down payments as low as $100 and requires a credit score as low as 500 to 580. You must agree to live in US Department of Housing and Urban Development-approved revitalization areas for 36 consecutive months to receive the discount.   For FHA borrowers, this mortgage allows you to qualify for a larger loan amount to finance energy-efficient improvements to your home. To qualify, you’ll order an energy assessment that will provide suggestions on how to lower your home’s energy use. An EEM mortgage can be used in conjunction with other mortgages like conventional loans, FHA and VA loans. You do not need to make a larger down payment for this additional funding, nor do you need to requalify. Once you’ve established whether you qualify as a first-time homebuyer, there are other requirements to meet. Qualifications may vary, but here are a few to consider.  Some first-time homebuyer programs may also require you to complete a homeowner education course. This isn’t the case for all first-time homebuyers, but your lender may request this. A first-time homebuyer program can help make homeownership more affordable and accessible by offering lower mortgage rates, down payment assistance and tax incentives. Additionally, many programs require you to take a homebuyer education class, which can help prepare you for the realities of homeownership.  These programs help reduce the barrier to homeownership, making it easier for more prospective homebuyers to qualify for a mortgage, says Nutall. Finding a suitable lender, let alone one that works specifically with first-time homebuyer programs, can be challenging.  To find the best mortgage lender for your first home purchase, start by figuring out your budget, deciding what you want in a home and determining the best type of mortgage loan for your situation. It’s advantageous to work with a lender that has experience dealing with the exact type of loan you want. This is especially true when you’re taking advantage of a government program, such as a VA loan or FHA loan.  Compare offers from a handful of mortgage lenders. This will help you find the best overall deal on your home loan. Interest rates and loan fees aren’t fixed, so it’s best to shop around and negotiate both of these costs. Communicating with a wide range of lenders (banks, credit unions or brokers) will help you get access to different mortgage programs and an array of loan terms. While navigating the homebuying process can be complicated, programs built for first-time buyers can make the process easier and much more accessible. These programs typically offer lower down payments, down payment assistance or closing cost assistance. To get started down the right path, it’s important to educate yourself on the programs you may qualify for and use that as a starting point on your journey towards closing on your first home.  CNET editors independently choose every product and service we cover.

That’s why many considered the iPhone to be revolutionary in 2007: it marked the beginning of an era in which our phones have come to function as miniature computers in addition to communication devices. But while Apple is largely credited with inventing the modern smartphone, it’s Android co-creator Andy Rubin’s mobile operating system that powers 85% of all smartphones being used around the world. Rubin wants to move the smartphone industry needle once more, if on a smaller scale. The first product to come from his new company, Essential, is an Android phone that aims to solve big industry problems, like bloatware (unnecessary apps loaded on phones by carriers) and accessories that become obsolete too soon. With the Essential Phone, which began shipping August 25 for $699, the company hopes to make inroads on Samsung and Apple’s turf. It’s available through Essential’s website and via Sprint, which is offering the device for $29.17 per month. Essential’s phone has many of the ingredients necessary for making a stellar smartphone, especially in its gorgeous yet durable build and long battery life. But neither of those characteristics are what impressed me most. It’s the Essential Phone’s interface — or lack thereof — that really caught my attention. Most Android phones are filled with apps and widgets from the carrier or phone manufacturer preinstalled on a phone. More often than not, these apps just clog up the home screen and app menu and add little or no value to the overall experience. The T-Mobile version of my Galaxy S8 review unit, for example, has three separate folders for apps from T-Mobile, Samsung and Google. The Essential Phone doesn’t have that problem (save for one Sprint app that was present on my review unit). The basic layout is so clean that the home screen doesn’t even have the time and weather widget found on most Android phones — it’s just a blank space, with Google’s search bar at the top. The result is a lightweight, easy-to-navigate interface that makes the Essential Phone feel snappy and smooth. The layout couldn’t be easier to learn, too. Swipe from the right to see recently downloaded apps, swipe down from the top for settings shortcuts and notifications, swipe from left to right for the Google Feed, and tap the arrow at the bottom of the screen to access the app drawer. It’s that simple. If there’s one trend that’s come to define smartphones this year, it’s the way their screens have changed. An increasing number of smartphone makers, from LG to Samsung and now Essential, have decreased the size of the borders that surround the phone’s screen. This makes it possible to increase screen size without having to make the phone physically larger. Each company has their own tactic for doing so: Samsung uses curved glass on its Galaxy S8 and S8+ to subtly bend the screen over the edges of the phone. The larger screen on the LG G6 occupies nearly the entire face of the phone. But both Samsung and LG include a thin black strip across the top of the screen where the front-facing camera sits. That’s a crucial area where the Essential Phone differs: there’s no strip across the top, just a small divot in the display top. I was apprehensive about this — in photos, the camera cutout looked awkward. But now that I’ve been using the phone, I can tell what a difference it makes. This design choice makes it feel more like you’re holding a sheet of glass than a phone. Read more: This Android Oreo Feature Could Fix a Huge Google Problem The Essential Phone’s titanium frame also feels sturdier than those found on many competitors. Its design may be my favorite thing about the phone, in fact. But there are a few imperfections: the fingerprint scanner located on the back of the phone rarely works on the first try. And the glossy back, while attractive, sometimes make the phone difficult to grip, and gets easily smudged with fingerprints. There’s also no headphone jack on Essential’s phone, meaning you’ll have to use the included adapter to connect wired headphones. But the Essential phone’s potentially most interesting feature is one I have yet to try. The device includes an accessory connection port that consists of two dots situated on the back of the device. The idea is to include a simple, economically viable port on the company’s future phones so that any accessories you buy today will continue to work with future phones. Essential’s first such add-on in a miniature 360-degree camera that attaches to the back of the phone. Motorola added a similar feature to its flagship smartphones in 2016. Since Motorola had an earlier lead, there’s already a wide array of available add-ons for its phones, such as a 360-degree camera, projector, camera grip, battery booster and speaker. Essential, by comparison, only offers a 360-degree camera at this point, and plans to launch a charging dock in the future. For taking pictures, the Essential Phone is decent but not as great as its competition. I found that both the iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S8 offered more vibrant color, and were better at zooming and shooting in low-light conditions. Apple and Samsung’s phones also offer extra features that the Essential Phone doesn’t, such as the iPhone 7’s Portrait Mode and the ability to take panoramic shots, which is available on both Apple and Samsung’s phones. Essential’s phone does offer a monochrome shooting mode since it has two cameras (one color, one black and white), but it’s not notably better than simply using a black-and-white filter in a photo editing app. Essential also says it will add new features like Portrait Mode and other improvements involving the camera’s image processing speed on an ongoing basis. In the photo samples below, you’ll notice that the flower’s pink color looks a bit washed-out in the Essential Phone’s photo, compared to the pictures taken on the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7 Plus. Essential iPhone 7 Plus Samsung Galaxy S8 Essential’s phone is one of the longest-lasting smartphones I’ve tested to date when it comes to battery life. After using the phone for more than 10 hours, I still had 61% of battery life left, allowing me to get through nearly two full workdays without having to charge. That’s more juice than I typically get out of the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S8, which last more than a full day, but never two. It’s worth noting that battery life will vary depending on how you use your phone, since certain apps and features tend to be more power-hungry. During this review period, I mostly used Essential’s phone for checking email, sending messages, taking photos, browsing social media, and streaming Netflix. Those who leave their phone brightness turned up, frequently connect to Bluetooth devices, and record a lot of video will probably get less mileage out of the device. The Essential Phone’s simplicity is what makes it great. The company didn’t cram in new features for the sake of trying to be clever or innovative. Android loyalists that just want Google’s clean Android interface without any bloatware will appreciate the Essential phone’s minimalist software. And the fact that it managed to pack a large, colorful screen and long-lasting battery into such a compact device is an engineering marvel. I just wish more of that innovation had been applied to the Essential Phone’s camera, which falls behind its competitors. If I’m shelling out $700, I don’t think expecting a more sophisticated camera is asking too much. 3.5 out of 5 Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4910581/android-oreo-project-treble/", "http://time.com/4541522/iphone-7-plus-portrait-mode-release-beta-how-to/"], "sentiment_score": 0.1499082114466731, "subjectivity_score": 0.45817216971063074},
{"type": "article", "header": "Here’s Your First Look at Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "August 23, 2017 11:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4908692/samsung-galaxy-note-8-release-date-specs/", "text": "Smartphones with large screens have become increasingly popular over the years — a trend that Samsung is largely responsible for thanks to its Galaxy Note phones. But last year, the company was forced to recall and discontinue the Note 7 after reports that the phone overheated and, in some cases, caught fire. The stain on Samsung’s reputation was so severe it was unclear whether the company, or more specifically the Note line, would ever recover. Nevertheless, Samsung is pushing ahead with the Note family of big-screened phones it first introduced in 2011. On Wednesday, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 8, which brings a critical and much-needed update to the Note family. The phone has a new design with sharper corners and an expansive screen that’s effectively borderless, similar to the Galaxy S8. That means the Note 8’s screen now measures 6.3 inches diagonally, an increase from the Note 7 and Note 5’s 5.7-inch display. Preorders for the Note 8 start on August 24 ahead of the phone’s September 15 release. Design aside, the most noticeable changes are in the Note 8’s photo capabilities: It now includes two 12-megapixel color cameras— one wide-angle and one telephoto—that enables a new feature called Live Focus. With this capability, users can partially blur the background of a photo in order to make the subject in the foreground appear sharper, an effect Apple added to the iPhone 7 Plus’ camera last year. But unlike Apple’s phone, which also comes with two cameras, Samsung’s device includes a slider for adjusting the amount of blur in the photo’s background. Both cameras also come with optical image stabilization for reducing unwanted fuzziness that may occur from shaky hands. Another new trick Samsung added to the Note 8 lets users snap two separate photos with the telephoto lens and wide-angle lens simultaneously to get one close up shot and another that includes the background. Read more: A ‘Smart Headset War’ Between Microsoft and Google Could Revolutionize the Workplace Samsung is also adding some subtle improvements to the Note’s software, including a tweak to its multi-window mode. Rather than having to manually launch two apps to view them on the screen simultaneously, users will be able to save their most frequently used app pairings to open them both at the same time. It’s similar to a new feature Apple will bring to the iPad when iOS 11 debuts this fall. Samsung hasn’t said whether this will also be available for the S8 in the future, but the company has previously brought features from its Note phones to its flagship line. Like many tech firms, including Apple and Google, Samsung is also making an effort to enhance the text messaging experience on its new phone. A new feature called Live Message lets users handwrite a note or sketch and then send it to the recipient as a GIF. Read more: The Best Laptops and Tablets for Back to School Otherwise, the phone’s hardware and software are similar to that of the Galaxy S8 and S8+, except for the amount of memory and the size of the battery. The Note 8 runs on the same processor as those phones, but has 6GB of RAM instead of 4GB, and comes with a 3,300 mAh battery. That’s could give it slightly longer battery life than the Galaxy S8, which has a 3,000 mAh battery, but perhaps not quite as much as the Galaxy S8+’s 3,500 mAh battery. Samsung also says the battery for its new Note has been independently verified by the Underwriters Laboratories to ensure that it meets safety standards, a crucial step in winning over consumer trust after the mishap with the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung also implemented a new eight-point battery safety check during its manufacturing process following the Note 7 recall, which involves checking all batteries for leaks and subjecting the batteries to stress tests designed to see how they perform when overcharged or are operating in extreme temperatures. The Galaxy Note 8 also inherits some other characteristics from its Galaxy S siblings, including iris and fingerprint recognition for unlocking the phone without entering a passcode, dust and water resistance, support for Samsung’s Bixby virtual voice assistant that lets owners use the phone hands-free, and compatibility with Samsung’s DeX dock. This accessory effectively uses the phone as the brains for a desktop computer, making it possible to plug in a keyboard, monitor, and mouse so that users can answer emails and play games on a larger screen. Those who want to continue using their legacy wired headphones without using an adapter won’t have to worry about the Note 8, as it will include a 3.5mm headphone jack. That’s unlike Apple’s latest iPhones and certain Android phones, such as the Moto Z2 Force and Essential phone, which require owners to use the included earbuds or attach their own wired headphones with an adapter. The Note 8 will certainly please Android fans who are looking for a large-screened phone. And thanks to its edge-to-edge display, it feels more compact and manageable than any other Note the company has introduced. It’s also the culmination of a trend we’ve seen from Samsung over the past couple of years: the slow merging of its Galaxy S family with the Note line. That’s precisely why Samsung named its last phablet the Note 7—skipping over the Note 6 name that was next in line—as it wanted smartphone shoppers to more closely associate the two devices. Now that the Note 8 is just about the same size as Samsung’s newest Galaxy S phone, the most important factors differentiating the two devices are the Note 8’s stylus and dual camera (the Galaxy S8 and S8+ lack both). It’s unclear whether those two features alone will be enough to convince shoppers to opt for the Note 8 over its flagship line, especially since pricing has yet to be announced. Samsung’s Note used to be a phone made for those who wanted a screen that was larger than what most other companies offered at the time. But now that big displays have become increasingly common, especially among Android phones, Samsung will have to search for new ways to make the Note stand out from the company’s other devices—and the competition.

To highlight just two: iPhone owners will no longer have to dig through their photo gallery to send or edit a screenshot, and the iPad’s multitasking sidebar can now be moved to the other side of the screen. Other changes are more than mere convenience-boosters, too. A few additions aim to change the way users interact with apps, while others make the iPad better-equipped to function as a laptop replacement. Here’s a breakdown of the features we’re most excited to see. Apple’s popular voice assistant is getting a major makeover in iOS 11. The most noticeable change will be its new voice, which now sounds more natural and less robotic. But it’s really what’s going on behind the scenes that’ll make the biggest difference in ease of use, with Siri now reacting to activities like web browsing or texting with deeper contextual information. When receiving a message that says something like “Where are you?” or “What time will you get here?” Siri will suggest sending the recipient’s estimated time of arrival by using data from Apple Maps. Similarly, when reading a web page in Safari, Siri will pull up related terms if the user taps the browser’s search bar. Second, Siri will also finally be able to translate languages in real-time, starting with support for converting English to French, German, Spanish, Italian or Chinese. A play button sits beside the results, offering a handy option to replay or listen to a translation while on the go. And third, instead of showing a single answer when Siri responds to a question, the digital helper will also offer an additional set of related items with the results. Altogether the changes should help Siri catch up to Google’s virtual assistant, which has long outshone Apple’s. The capabilities of these evolving virtual butlers couldn’t be more important as companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and now Apple race to place digital helpers in everything from living rooms to cars. When iOS 11 launches this fall, a slew of apps that use the iPhone’s camera in new ways are coming to the App Store. That’s because Apple’s new iPhone and iPad software will support apps built on Apple’s new augmented reality platform, called ARKit. Augmented reality is a way of describing software that uses a device’s camera to create the illusion of blending the real world with digital elements, making it seem as if objects are appearing on real-world surfaces. Though iOS 11 has yet to launch, developers have been toiling to create apps that showcase its dramatic new possibilities. So far, these include a version of Eric Carle’s iconic children’s book The Very Hungry Caterpillar that brings the eponymous tiny creature into the user’s living room, as well as new games that take advantage of the player’s surroundings. If these types of apps catch on, ARKit could help usher in a new wave of apps that make smartphones better at real world tasks, such as functioning as a ruler or providing a means of seeing whether new furniture will fit in a room. Anyone who’s used Apple’s tablet for getting work done has probably cursed its lack of a desktop-equivalent access tools. Apple’s new Files app should help compensate for this by giving the iPad a central hub for documents and files. The Files app allows users to pin folders from their cloud service of choice, while also housing files stored locally on the tablet in a single app. It should give the iPad a much-needed productivity boost when compared to Microsoft’s Surface tablets, which have long been capable of running full desktop Windows apps. Apple Pay isn’t just for making purchases in-store or online anymore. Come this fall, iPhone and iPad owners will be able use it to send money through iMessage. It’s similar Venmo, PayPal’s mobile payment service, but potentially more useful for those trying to reach friends and family members who own an iPhone but don’t want to futz with a new app. Apple also offers a couple of helpful perks: Funds received from these transactions can also be used anywhere Apple Pay is accepted. And since it’s integrated into the Messages app, users can tap any monetary amount mentioned in the conversation to instantly kick off a new transaction. Artificial intelligence is already present in iOS, but Apple is adding tools that make it easier for developers to integrate the technology into their own apps. That should mean faster performance in apps, especially where image recognition is involved. In a demo of the dieting app Lose It on an iPhone running iOS 11, for instance, I noticed that the app was able to quickly identify a bunch of carrots after snapping the photo. Or take apartment hunting app PadMapper: When creating a rental listing, the app uses image recognition to help choose the best cover photo, and it’ll automatically list amenities it spots in the image, like a dishwasher or washer and dryer. It’s one of those subtle-but-potentially-game-changing things that could significantly improve app efficiency and accuracy if developers implement the new technology in clever ways.

But in view of the features packed into recent Android rivals like the Galaxy Note and Essential Phone, the anticipation around Apple’s imminent late summer event is unusually high. The Cupertino, Califorinia-based tech giant is expected to debut three new smartphones on September 12, including a 10th anniversary edition iPhone that could bring the biggest changes Apple’s iconic mobile devices have seen in years. With this new iPhone, which may cost upwards of $1,000, Apple is expected to make several much-needed alterations that should give it a leg up in the perennial clash of iPhone vs. Android. Among the most noticeable may be a radical redesign that adds a sharper, larger screen and new sensors for facial recognition. Such changes would be crucial for Apple to keep pace with Android smartphone makers like Samsung, Essential and OnePlus, all of whom have stepped up innovations in design and power consumption that leave Apple’s current iPhones behind in key areas. Here are five ways Android phones have pulled ahead of the iPhone in recent years. Given our reliance on mobile devices for everything from finding our way home to catching up on work emails, a smartphone’s battery never lasts long enough. While endless battery life is a pipe dream, some manufacturers have made strides in charging speed, making it easier to top off your battery if, say, you only have 15 minutes near an airport outlet. Samsung’s flagship smartphones have included quick charge technology since 2015, while even OnePlus’ low-end 3T model offers the feature. Apple hasn’t made any advancements in this area yet, but rumors indicate the company’s 2017 iPhones may support the USB-C version of USB Power Delivery, which enables speedier charging experiences. This is arguably the area where Apple currently lags most. Take a look at the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus alongside the latest phones from Samsung, LG, and Essential, and the iPhone 7 family feels archaic. That’s because these smartphone makers have redesigned their newest mobile devices to include screens so large that they dominate the face of the phone. Many have done so by making the borders around the display smaller (not unlike the shrinking frames around flat-screen TVs), allowing for more visual real estate without expansing the phone’s physical dimensions. By comparison, Apple’s most recent iPhones still have chunky bezels above and below the display, where components such as the home button, speaker and front-facing camera are situated. That could all change next month, as the 10th anniversary edition iPhone is expected to lose its physical home button and add a gigantic edge-to-edge screen. It’s an overhaul the iPhone needs in order to keep up with its biggest Android competitors. But the quality of the iPhone’s display could stand improvement, too. Although the iPhone’s display is top-notch, the liquid crystal displays (LCD) on Apple’s smartphones don’t offer as much contrast as the organic light emitting diode (OLED) screens on rival phones made by Samsung. Plus, OLED displays don’t require backlights, potentially netting battery life savings. This is another improvement Apple is expected to introduce on its premium iPhone next month. Apple’s entry level iPhone 7 offers 32GB of storage, which is half the 64GB storage capacity offered by some Android phones. If you need more than 32GB, you have to shell out another $100 for the 128GB model. Essential’s phone is one example of an Android device that offers a better deal when it comes to storage. With Essential, consumers get 128GB inside a phone that costs $700, whereas Apple charges $749 for the version of its iPhone with the same capacity. And although Samsung charges $724 for the 64GB Galaxy S8, which is only $25 cheaper than the 128GB iPhone 7, the S8 includes a microSD card slot for adding additional space. The OnePlus 5 also provides 64GB of storage in its base option, which only costs $479, making it $179 cheaper than the 32GB iPhone 7. There’s a slim to none chance that Apple will ever add expandable storage to the iPhone. But the company is rumored to be bringing back the 64GB configuration with its next smartphone, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Wouldn’t it be great if you could pack the same charger for both your iPhone and laptop? As gadget manufacturers have gradually adopted the new USB-C standard, Apple’s proprietary Lightning charger feels increasingly inconvenient. Nearly every major Android phone uses a USB-C port for charging, which is the same type of connector used to charge many modern laptops and non-iPad tablets as well. The Wall Street Journal said in February that Apple is planning to replace the iPhone’s Lightning port with a USB-C slot. But KGI Securities’ Kuo has a slightly different take: He predicts that new iPhones will retain the same Lightning port, but this year’s models will have USB-C Power Delivery baked in to speed up the charging time. Apple finally made its smartphones water resistant when it introduced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus last year, but it’s done little else to make the iPhone less prone to damage. Companies like Motorola are leading the charge in this area by adding shatter-resistant displays to phones such as the Moto Z2 Force and Droid Turbo 2. Essential’s phone also has a titanium frame that’s said to be more sturdy and durable than the aluminum used on most smartphones. Little has been said at this point about next-gen iPhone shatter-resistance, but if the so-called iPhone 8 or iPhone X is capable of wireless charging (as rumored), it stands to reason the new phone may include technology like full waterproofing as well.

But internal changes are abound, from an amped-up processor to an upgraded camera. This year’s iPhone marks a turning point for the Cupertino, Calif. company. Apple has long followed a “tick-tock” pattern for its iPhones. In a “tick” year, the company reveals a dramatic redesign, as it did with the iPhone 6 and its larger screen in 2014. In a “tock” year, Apple offers an incremental update to the previous model, like it did with the iPhone 5s, which looked like the iPhone 5 but with a new fingerprint scanner. Apple is now straying from that cycle, introducing an iPhone — the iPhone 7 — that looks remarkably similar to the iPhone 6 and 6s. Rather than giving the 7 a complete exterior makeover, Apple improved characteristics like battery life, camera quality, and physical durability. That’s a risky move for the company, which has until now been able to count on big, easily noticeable upgrades every two years to juice sales of the iPhone, its best-selling product. Read more: We took Apple’s iPhone 7 to Zion National Park So what’s noteworthy about the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus? For one, they’re the first Apple smartphones officially certified as water resistant. Their upgraded cameras take in more light, while the larger Plus model features a second lens for zooming. Under-the-hood processor improvements mean faster performance and better battery life. In these ways and others, Apple is catching up to its smartphone rivals, notably Samsung, which makes some of the best Android phones available. I’ve been using the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as my primary phone for the past several days. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use them. Look and Feel Yes, the iPhone 7 looks very similar to the iPhone 6s. But there are some subtle changes. Most notably, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come in two new finishes, Black and Jet Black. The standard Black model is similar to Apple’s other finishes, but in a darker shade than the Space Gray variant. It has a clean, matte look that feels fresh alongside Apple’s gray and silver options. Meanwhile, the Jet Black finish is a striking departure from Apple’s usual style. It has a glossy, piano-like look that vaguely resembles the iPhone 5C’s shiny aesthetic. It’s nice, but there’s a drawback: The Jet Black model is a magnet for fingerprints and other smudges, meaning buyers will probably want to add a case that largely hides the finish anyway. Flip over the iPhone 7 and you’ll notice another physical change. Gone are the antenna lines that stretch across the back of the phone. Apple has instead embedded them in a less noticeable location toward the top of the device. (They’re practically invisible on the new Jet Black and Black finishes.) It’s a subtle tweak that distinguishes the iPhone 7 from many similar-looking rivals. But again, if you plan to use a case, you won’t notice this change. The real trick to telling the iPhone 7 apart from its predecessor is flipping it upside-down in search of a headphone jack, because the new iPhone doesn’t have one. That’s a highly controversial move. Anybody who wants to bring their old, wired headphones to this particular party will need to use Apple’s included adapter, which connects them through the iPhone 7’s Lightning port. (Apple also includes a pair of its wired earbuds that connect the same way; it’s separately selling a pair of wireless earbuds we’ll discuss separately.) How big of a deal is headphone jack’s disappearance? Music fans who’ve splurged on high-end headphones may be peeved about keeping track of an additional adapter that might be easily lost; replacements will cost $9.99. And iPhone 7 users won’t be able to listen to songs through wired headphones and charge their phone at the same time without an optional dock. But for people who just want to listen to music on their morning commute or during a jog, Apple’s included earbuds will do just fine. Another difference becomes apparent only when actually using the iPhone 7. The home button that sits below the screen isn’t a “button” in the most traditional sense, meaning it doesn’t depress when pushed. Instead, it’s powered by Apple’s “Taptic Engine,” a vibration device also found on the latest MacBooks and the Apple Watch. When you click the iPhone 7’s home button, the Taptic Engine produces a clicking sensation mimicking an actual press. The button takes a little getting used to, especially if you haven’t used the Taptic Engine on other Apple gear. And it doesn’t necessarily make it easier to unlock your phone or launch Siri. But it does make the iPhone experience feel more consistent overall, as the iPhone’s “3D Touch” provides a similar sensation. Since Apple no longer uses a mechanical button for the home key, there’s also less of a chance it will malfunction after extended use. Why get rid of the headphone jack and a “true” home button? The changes helped Apple reach a larger goal: Water resistance. Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus can be submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes, which should mean an accidental drop in the pool or a sudden rainstorm will no longer put the device’s life in jeopardy. After dunking my iPhone 7 in roughly one foot of water multiple times, the device continued to work flawlessly. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 has a slightly higher tolerance level; it can survive in five feet of water for up to 30 minutes. Camera Both of Apple’s new iPhones have gotten a noticeable boost when it comes to photography. This is especially apparent in three specific areas: low-light performance, color capture, and, for the iPhone 7 Plus model only, zooming. To be blunt: Yes, the camera on this year’s iPhone is definitely an improvement over that of the iPhone 6s. The new phones’ cameras shoot beautifully vibrant photos, making those taken with the iPhone 6s almost look dull in comparison. This was a much needed boost, as rivals like Samsung have been steadily improving their cameras. Apple’s approach towards photography has long been different from that of its competition. iPhones typically capture scenes more in tune with how they look in real life, instead of exaggerating colors for an easy but less accurate “pop.” This year, Apple has upped the colors just enough to make the iPhone’s photos appear more vivid without going too far. Some samples and comparisons below: iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus Samsung Galaxy S7 Motorola Moto Z Droid iPhone 6s Apple fans serious about mobile photography will probably want to opt for the iPhone 7 Plus model, which features a big benefit missing from the smaller model: A second camera lens. This extra lens, which is telephoto instead of the typical wide-angle glass, is designed to take better zoomed-in photos, long an Achilles’ heel of smartphone cameras. The lens can physically zoom up to 2x, with digital zoom taking it the rest of the way to 10x. Apple’s other iPhones can only zoom up to 5x, and that’s all digital zoom. (Physical zoom typically offers a better-quality photo than digital zoom, which is effectively equivalent to cropping a photo after it’s been taken.) The iPhone 7 Plus’ telephoto lens offers an unprecedented level of detail while zooming. Below, you can see the photos I captured of a chalkboard sign outside a local restaurant while zoomed in as far as possible. You’ll notice the text in the image taken with the iPhone 7 Plus looks much crisper. That’s not to say you’ll achieve perfectly sharp photos while zooming — there’s only so much you’ll get from a smartphone compared to a telephoto lens on a high-end camera. But it’s impressive nonetheless for a smartphone. iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus Samsung Galaxy S7 Motorola Moto Z Droid iPhone 6s Apple’s new iPhones are also much better at taking photos in low light, thanks to a wider aperture (f/1.8, instead of f/2.2) and a new four-LED flash that’s 50% brighter than previous models. In my testing, the improved flash felt better at lighting subjects more evenly and capturing accurate skin tones compared to past iPhones. But the flash didn’t light scenes as evenly as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 did under the same conditions — though the iPhone 7’s flash was brighter. For the selfie-takers out there, Apple’s latest iPhones also pack improved the front-facing cameras. Both devices come with a new 7-megapixel front camera, a modest improvement over the last model’s 5 megapixels. The difference isn’t too noticeable compared to the iPhone 6s, but it outranks both Samsung and Motorola’s latest phones when it comes to taking great selfies. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 makes the colors in selfies look bolder, but its images aren’t as detailed as the front-facing photos taken with the iPhone 7. The Galaxy S7’s front camera also struggled with lighting in my testing scenario, resulting in a photo that had a yellowish tint compared to the iPhone’s. Using It Apple’s new iPhones are powered by the company’s latest processor, the A10 Fusion. The new hardware packs four cores, double that of the A9, with two designated for high-performance tasks and an additional pair optimized for efficiency. The two performance cores alone are 40% faster than the A9 chip inside the iPhone 6s and twice as speedy as the iPhone 6’s A8, according to Apple. The improved performance is somewhat noticeable in everyday tasks: the iPhone 7’s camera launches slightly faster than that of the 6s, and the phone unlocks just a hair quicker as well. These enhancements are more prominent when using more resource-greedy apps, like Prisma, which uses artificial intelligence to edit photos in the style of famous artists. With the iPhone 7, the Prisma app was able to work its apparent magic a few seconds faster than it does on the iPhone 6s. The new A10 Fusion chip also contributes to the new iPhones’ improved battery life. While you’re chatting, snapping and gaming away, the iPhone 7 is busy determining which core should be used at any given moment, making it better at power management. Indeed, Apple claims the iPhone 7 can last up to two hours longer than the iPhone 6s on a full charge. I’ve found that to be generally true, although battery life will always vary depending on how you use your phone. The iPhone 6s usually gets me through a full day and can just scrape by until the early morning if I don’t plug it in overnight. By contrast, the iPhone 7 provided a full work day’s worth of use and survived until around 10:30 am the next morning, which falls about in line with Apple’s claims. (My daily smartphone usage typically consists of streaming music, sending text messages, checking Facebook and Twitter, sending and reading email, browsing the web, occasionally playing games, streaming video, and using Bluetooth accessories. If this sounds like your routine, you can likely expect similar results, but those looking for more battery power might want to opt for the 7 Plus and its beefier battery.) It’s worth noting here that while Apple has managed to improve the iPhone’s battery life, it hasn’t sped up the charging process itself. Some Android smartphones, like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and OnePlus 3, support quick charging technology; OnePlus says its phone can recharge up to 60% after being plugged in for just 30 minutes. (Samsung, it should be said, is currently embroiled in a massive recall involving battery issues with its Galaxy Note 7.) If you often listen to music or watch movies on your phone without headphones, you’ll be happy to know the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the first Apple smartphones with stereo speakers. Audio from TV shows, games and music all sounds deeper and richer here compared to the iPhone 6s. Still, you’ll get better sound out of almost any pair of headphones. The Taptic Engine powering the iPhone 7’s home button is also front-and-center in Apple’s new smartphone software, iOS 10. The refreshed user interface is loaded with elements that take advantage of the engine’s vibrations — switching on an alarm in the Clock app produces a subtle but satisfying click, for example. Android phones have used vibrations in similar ways for years, especially for on-screen keyboards and navigational buttons. And for the first time, Apple is opening the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus’ Engine to third-party app developers, so they can use it in their apps and games. How useful this becomes largely depends on the developers. Conclusion Speaking with CNBC earlier this year, Apple’s CEO teased that the company would “give you things that you can’t live without that you just don’t know that you need today.” Do the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus live up to that statement? Not quite. If you’re already carrying an iPhone 6s, there’s little need to upgrade, unless you’re a photography nut or desperately need better battery life. And many of the most exciting changes Apple has in store are actually part of iOS 10, the software upgrade that will also be available for older iPhones. That said, the modest improvements make these the best iPhones Apple has made to date — but it’s nowhere near as big of an upgrade as the iPhone 6 was compared to past models. The iPhone 7 may be evidence that gone are the days when a new smartphone could truly wow the world. After all, there’s only so much functionality you can pack in these devices before you enter the realm of the superfluous. Apple’s rivals are experimenting features that represent brilliant feats of engineering, like eye scanners that let you unlock your phone by looking at it, curved screens, and virtual reality support. But perhaps what Apple realizes is that what most people want from their phones is simpler than all that: Long battery life, durability, and a great camera. There’s certainly room for improvement — quick-charging would be nice — but the iPhone 7 delivers on these vital points. It doesn’t “wow” like so many Apple products have. But then again, maybe it doesn’t need to. It’s not a huge upgrade, but it helps Apple’s smartphone remain one of the best around. 4 out of 5 stars Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4480610/apple-iphone-7-plus-release-date-price-specs/", "http://time.com/4487463/iphone-7-camera-review-hands-on-zion", "http://time.com/4487463/iphone-7-camera-review-hands-on-zion", "http://time.com/4458155/iphone-photo-apps-instagram-prisma/", "http://time.com/4484883/samsung-galaxy-note-7-warning-faa/", "http://time.com/4395343/apple-iphone-ios-10-preview-features-download-hands-on/"], "sentiment_score": 0.1454242755966894, "subjectivity_score": 0.4706937187971672},

But tucked in-between the razzle-dazzle of flashy new tech was perhaps the most consequential news of the day: iPhones with that upcoming version of iOS will detect when you’re driving, and silence incoming notifications. The feature, called Do Not Disturb While Driving, could help prevent distracted driving. Such incidents killed nearly 3,500 people in 2015, according to the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration, with 391,000 lesser injuries. (That data includes distractions other than gadgets).

That’s largely because the best virtual reality headsets available are still considerably more expensive and require some time and effort to set up. Microsoft is one of several tech companies hoping to address those issues, and the culmination of its efforts will debut later this year. Microsoft announced late last year that it would work with its PC hardware partners to develop headsets that support virtual and augmented reality. These headsets run a new version of Microsoft’s software called Windows Mixed Reality, a version of Windows devoted to augmented and virtual reality experiences. Microsoft is hoping to make virtual reality more accessible to consumers by ensuring that these headsets are compatible with cheaper computers. While the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive must be tethered to high-end PCs to work, Windows Mixed Reality headsets will be able to run on laptops that don’t include dedicated graphics card, while the goggles themselves will start at $299. And because these devices are running on the same software platform, multiplayer games will work across different types of Windows headsets. The first of these devices, which include VR viewers made by HP and Acer, will launch in time for the holiday season. I had the chance to try on a Windows Mixed Reality headset designed by popular PC-maker Acer, along with the new VR motion controllers (announced in May). During my demo, I sampled a few Windows MR apps that included alien and zombie-themed shooter games, a virtual paintball match and a gorgeous 3D puzzler. What immediately struck me was how different the launch screen feels compared to headsets made by Facebook and HTC. Instead of scrolling through a menu to select things, the Windows Mixed Reality launcher requires the user to virtually explore a luxurious virtual home in order to discover and launch apps. These apps are scattered throughout the environment: one appeared in the living room, for example, while another was situated on the roof. It’s Microsoft’s attempt to create a virtual reality interface analogous to a computer’s desktop. I tilted the motion controller’s joystick to move about the space, which teleported me in the direction I was currently facing — a common tactic for navigating around a virtual environment in VR. Overall, the new motion controllers felt responsive and were comfortable to hold, though button placement may need work: I kept getting kicked out of apps because I was accidentally hitting the Windows button. Although these headsets will work with computers containing either integrated or dedicated graphics, the experience will differ depending on the type of laptop you own. I tried both types of systems during my demo, and the laptop with dedicated graphics was unsurprisingly able to run more visually complex games. Computers with integrated graphics will still be able to run games like Minecraft and immersive 360 travel tour apps, but they likely stumble when tackling more resource-hungry ones. These Windows Mixed Reality headsets feel like a middle ground between smartphone-based virtual reality (Samsung’s Gear VR) and premium headsets (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive). But there’s a crucial element that differentiates them from either tier: Windows Mixed Reality headsets include extra sensors built into the headset, making it possible to track your position in virtual space without external hardware. It’s this technology that makes it possible to walk around the virtual environment and pick up a digital paintball gun, or run up to your opponent’s flag and grab it to win the match. And it’s what makes really convincing virtual reality feel so immersive. This is perhaps the key differentiator between a high-end headset like the Oculus Rift and Samsung’s budget-priced Gear VR. The Gear VR has lack tethers or the need for external sensors, but it’s a barebones headset powered by a smartphone. The Rift and HTC Vive offer far greater immersion, but require sensors placed around the room, which can be tedious to take down and set back up if you lack a dedicated space. The technique Microsoft and its partners are using is known as inside-out tracking, and Facebook, Google, and Intel are all working on virtual reality products using similar technology. What will truly determine whether these Windows-powered VR headsets are successful is the quality and variety of apps they’re compatible with, of course. Windows Mixed Reality will support apps and experiences from Sony, Jaunt and Hulu in addition to games like Rec Room (a VR social club that supports multiplayer paintball and other sports games) and Dreadhalls (a horror-themed dungeon crawler). Microsoft is also bringing popular games it owns to Windows Mixed Reality, including Halo and Minecraft, and its headsets will also be compatible with games from Valve’s digital Steam store. What I saw of Windows Mixed Reality looked promising, offering some interesting solutions to obvious problems that plague virtual reality today. Whether it’s the right technology at the right time is harder to say. As companies like HTC and Oculus lower the prices of their headsets and eventually get around to rolling out their own headsets with inside-out tracking, the stakes are only going up.

Some involved incremental changes to hardware and software, while others provided a glimpse at where Apple believes the future of computing is headed. Here’s a recap of Apple’s most important announcements at WWDC 2017. As per usual, Apple dedicated a significant portion of its WWDC keynote to the new software features coming to the iPhone and iPad. In iOS 11, iPhone owners will be getting a new Venmo-style option for sending money to friends via Apple Pay, a redesigned control center, a refreshed Apple Music app with more social features, a new Siri with a natural-sounding voice, and an improved Do Not Disturb feature designed to prevent distracted driving, among other additions. Apple also announced camera improvements, including more photo effects like long exposure mode and upgrades for better low-light photography. Apple is now battling with Amazon and Google for control of your living room. The company unveiled the HomePod, a speaker with Siri built-in that’s powered by the same processor found in older iPhones. It will launch for $349 in December, making it noticeably more expensive than the standard $179 Echo and $129 Google Home. As is the case with these aforementioned rivals, owners will be able to control the HomePod with their voice, asking Siri to check the weather, provide traffic updates, control smart home devices, and send text messages. Apple is promoting the HomePod as a cross between a dedicated home assistant and a high-end speaker, saying it can adjust its audio output depending on the size of the room it’s in. Despite consecutive quarters of slumping shipments, Apple made it clear on Monday that it remains dedicated to the iPad. The company is releasing new iPad Pro models in both 10.5 and 12.9-inch sizes, marking the first time Apple has released a 10.5-inch tablet. The smaller version will start at $649, while the larger starts at $799; both will start shipping next week. The two new iPads will feature a new screen with ProMotion technology, which the company says should offer a faster refresh rate of up to 120Hz to make tasks like scrolling and using the Apple Pencil feel smoother. Both tablets are also getting a new A10X Fusion processor that the company says makes them 30% faster than older iPads running on the previous A9X chip. There are also noteworthy changes coming on the software side. Apple’s iOS 11 will bring new features that could make iPad Pro tablets function much better as a laptop replacement, such as a new app for managing files, a customizable on-screen dock, faster multitasking, and drag-and-drop capabilities. Apple CEO Tim Cook has teased for months that the company is serious about augmented reality. Monday’s presentation provided the first real evidence of that as the company debuted ARKit, a new suite of tools for developers to help them create AR apps for the iPhone and iPad. During a demo at WWDC, Apple showcased software that could place virtual objects on a real-world table via the iPhone’s camera. A digital lamp and coffee cup even generated shadows when the light was turned on and off during the demonstration. The announcement comes as companies like Facebook and Microsoft have been aggressively pushing into the augmented reality space as well. Apple refreshed its entire Mac hardware line at WWDC, introducing a flashy new iMac Pro with an 18-core processor and 22 teraflops of GPU performance, an iMac with better graphics and faster processors, and MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops with speed boosts of their own. On the software side, Apple announced the next big update to the Mac, called macOS High Sierra. It supports the Apple File System, which should make tasks like duplicating files much speedier, a new version of the Metal API, and a new sidebar in the Photos app for quicker access to editing tools and albums, among other enhancements. The Apple Watch will soon be getting an update that brings new watch faces, additional fitness features, and other changes. One such watch face will use Siri to serve up information it thinks is relevant based on the time of day. For fitness fanatics, Apple is adding the ability for the Watch to exchange data with gym machinery in real time to gather more accurate data.

That’s orders of magnitude higher than what’s needed in order to make it a viable option for use in mobile devices, where power is always at a premium. The iPhone’s battery hovers around 1,500 mAh, which is many, many times smaller than is needed to power such a chip for any length of time. The Myriad 1 operates in the range of a couple hundred milliwats — making putting this kind of chip on a phone possible. It’s hard to understate the importance of battery efficiency in mobile. Battery life is often the bottleneck for new technologies — the first 4G LTE phones, for example, were battery killers — and that’s not going to change given that radical new battery technology is years away. The battery problem will become even bigger with the push into wearable technologies. Google Glass struggles to last through a day of moderate use, and with the camera in use it doesn’t last an hour. We’ve yet to see a smartwatch that can last a full week. Although Project Tango exists in phone form today, it seems much more practical as a technology for wearable devices. If I’m walking down the street in search of a store or restaurant, I’m not going to start waving my phone around to get descriptions of each storefront. But let’s say I’m wearing something like Google Glass. Now it makes more sense to have an app that knows what I’m looking at, interprets the 3D position of the building and overlays a description in 3D space. Another example: If I’m using a smartwatch, perhaps it could detect whether I’m home alone or at a friend’s house with a half-dozen people, and re-prioritize which notifications I get. By comparison, the spatial awareness that Project Tango provides will be lost on smartphones, which stay in our pockets until we know we need them. If the claims about power efficiency by Google and partner company Movidius hold up, Project Tango isn’t going to matter much for smartphones. It’s really a play for what comes next.

{"type": "article", "header": "Microsoft’s CEO Responds to Concerns About AI", "author": "Alana Semuels", "update_date/publish_date": "May 9, 2023 10:44 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6278179/satya-nadella-ai-concerns/", "text": "There’s no shortage of concern about the speed with which some of the world’s top artificial intelligence research labs are rolling out new AI tools that could change the way we live and work. The release of generative AI tools like ChatGPT to the public has prompted consternation about privacy and the spread of misinformation and bias. Not long after Microsoft released an AI-powered version of its search tool, Bing, to a select group of users in February, Bing threatened a philosophy professor with blackmail. A month later, some of the biggest names in tech signed an open letter urging the world’s leading artificial intelligence labs to pause training their super-powerful computer systems for six months, arguing that recent advances in AI present “profound risks to society and humanity.” In an op-ed in TIME the same day, Eliezer Yudkowsky, a decision theorist who leads the nonprofit Machine Intelligence Research Institute, urged the labs to shut down their research entirely. “Many researchers steeped in these issues, including myself, expect that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die,” he wrote. But Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella isn’t worried. Microsoft has put at least $13 billion into OpenAI, the lab that launched ChatGPT in November; both Microsoft and Google rolled out products in March that they say will use AI to transform work—Google with AI powered features in Workspace that auto generate images, write and rewrite documents, and sort email; Microsoft with Copilot, an AI-based tool that works across its 365 suite of software (Word, Excel, Outlook) to summarize meetings, draft emails, and analyze data. In a May 8 interview, Nadella said Microsoft has done its best to mitigate unintended consequences of AI. Copilot, for example, does not create content or send emails without a human first entering data that guides the AI’s response. Such AI solutions, he says, will do our drudge work, freeing us to do the creative tasks where humans excel. Read More: The AI Arms Race Is Changing Everything While skeptics cite big concerns about job displacement with this new wave of AI, Nadella argues that AI can democratize access to new skills, helping displaced workers find new jobs. Anyone can use generative AI—essentially algorithms that can create new content, including emails, white papers, and even code—as a partner at work, even if they don’t have a traditional education. That means that more people can become software engineers or security analysts, because they’ll be working alongside skilled AI. Microsoft thinks the world can sustain a billion professional developers and that AI can help quicken that growth. “That’s why AI is exciting,” he says. “We need new technology to help us with the economic growth that we enjoyed in the early part of the 20th century. What if we can have that type of economic growth this time around, but it’s much more even?” It’s true that productivity growth has been stunted in the U.S. After rising at an average rate of 2.8% between 1948 and 1970, productivity growth slowed to just 1.4% in the last 15 years. One reason for this slowdown, put forward by the economist Robert Gordon, is that we lack the technological advancements that came before 1970, like indoor plumbing, commercial air travel and the widespread adoption of communications technology. (The U.S. also saw a boost of productivity in the 1990s after the adoption of the PC.) Nadella thinks AI might bring productivity growth back to the halcyon days of the mid-20th century. Yes, there are risks to deploying AI, he says—jobs may be displaced, people may have to go through transitions, and AI may learn biases because the information it learns from comes from real people, who themselves have biases. But the benefits of AI could outweigh the risks. Microsoft’s own data suggests that the way we work today is broken. Microsoft’s Work Trends Index, released on May 9, shows that nearly two in three people polled say they struggle with having the time and energy to do their own job. The index surveyed 31,000 workers across 31 markets in February and March of 2023, and found that across Microsoft’s 365 software, the average employee spends a whopping 57% of their time communicating, and the rest creating. As a result, creativity is lagging; nearly two in three managers say they are concerned about a lack of innovation or breakthroughs on their teams. Of course, even if AI does alleviate some of the negative parts of people’s jobs, it might create new issues for much of the workforce in the process. AI can and probably will displace jobs. It can and probably will provide more misinformation into a world already full of it. It can and probably will exacerbate existing racial biases, since it learns from information already available in the world. And perhaps most pertinent for people already overwhelmed with information at work: it can and probably will create even more information for us to sift through. “AI is both going to be responsible for helping us manage a lot more knowledge but also creating a lot more knowledge that we will have to handle,” says Rowan Curran, an analyst at Forrester who researches AI and machine learning. Nadella contends that the benefits of AI—Microsoft’s AI, at least—will outweigh the potential negatives. After all, Microsoft put humans in the center of AI design by choice, he says, which in itself mitigates unintended consequences, he says. And, he notes, there is already healthy dialogue between governments and companies about what kind of regulation there should be on AI. “At the end of the day, I think we will all be judged by one thing alone, which is, “Do the benefits far outweigh anything that are the societal consequences?” That said, Microsoft has actively resisted European Union efforts to regulate the use of AI. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act could ban certain uses of AI like facial recognition technologies, but Microsoft and Google have lobbied to ensure that “general purpose AI” of the kind that ChatGPT is based on is not covered in the regulations. Nadella said he was unfamiliar with what Microsoft may or may not be doing in Europe. He also refused to commit to any limits on the use of AI in military applications—relevant because competitor Google had to forgo a contract with the military that used AI to interpret video images and could have been used for drone strikes after thousands of workers signed a letter in protest. Read More: The New AI-Powered Bing Is Threatening Users. That’s No Laughing Matter Of course, we still don’t know the societal consequences of relatively unchecked AI usage. Critics say they could be dire, and that even AI developers do not understand the possibilities. Nadella says that this type of complexity or uncertainty aren’t unusual—we study science because we don’t fully understand it, after all. Today’s AI, he argues, fulfills the promise of the modern computer industry, which was founded in part to create tools to help the human mind understand more of the world around it. Way back in 1945, for example, in a seminal 1945 essay in The Atlantic, Vannevar Bush, an engineer who led the U.S. Office of Scientific and Research Development, suggested that further human advancement could only come if man mechanized his records more completely. AI may be the next step in this development, Nadella says, arguing that calls on companies to stop working with AI are, in some ways, calls to stop embracing economic growth. And this growth, because it’s so accessible, doesn’t have to be limited to Silicon Valley or even the U.S., but can be more widespread, he says. “Creating technologies that allow us as humans to be able to increase our knowledge, do science, and help the human condition is what has been core to enlightenment,” he says. “And so therefore trying to say, ‘Well, now is the time to stop,’ that doesn’t seem the right approach.” It may seem surprising that Microsoft, which not long ago seemed like it was falling behind competitors to its hoary Word and Outlook offerings, is talking about providing products that are the “core to enlightenment.” In the 2010s, as Apple and Google introduced new operating systems including web-based apps that stole Microsoft customers, some analysts were writing off Microsoft as a doomed business because of its focus on software that could easily be replaced, says Jason Wong, an analyst at Gartner. But Nadella, who took the helm in 2014, recognized the value of the cloud, and of artificial intelligence, Wong says. Microsoft’s share price has risen nearly tenfold since Nadella took the helm; the S&P 500 has merely doubled its value over the same time. The AI arms race is just beginning. For now, though, AI is showing up in something not very intimidating and perhaps even a little disappointing: applications like Word, Outlook, and Excel, the productivity software that many people have used for years and that would certainly be hard to imagine taking over the world and killing us all. That said, researchers have admitted that they don’t always understand why generative AI produces the results it does. As Microsoft lifts the lid off of its AI, releasing Copilot to more customers (its initial launch was for 20 enterprise customers) and integrating more AI like the open image generator DALL-E into PowerPoint, what is so scary is that no one—not even Satya Nadella—knows what is going to happen next.

That makes it $200 more expensive than the Oculus Rift, which is currently on sale for $399 for a limited time, and the $399 standalone PlayStation VR. HTC is also bundling VR apps such as Google’s Tilt Brush, EverestVR, and Richie’s Plank Experience, as well as a free trial of Viveport Subscription, a service that lets players try out up to five titles per month. When the Vive first launched for $799 last April, its ability to provide room scale virtual experiences set it apart from the Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR. With the Vive, it’s possible to walk around a designated space and interact with virtual objects by using (somewhat) natural hand motions. At the time, the Oculus Rift only supported experiences in which the user was seated and stationary, requiring a handheld controller rather than gestures. Much has changed since then: The Oculus Rift now also supports room scale VR and motion controls, and it’s price has also come down significantly.

But for all the high-tech VR headsets on the market today, most are riddled with shortcomings. Among the biggest complaints about modern VR: High-end headsets require a powerful (and pricy) computer to run, they must remain tethered to that computer when in use, which can be cumbersome during gameplay, and they’re a pain to set up. To one degree or another, these gripes are true of all the most popular VR goggles out there, from the Oculus Rift to the HTC Vive and the Sony PlayStation VR. Thankfully for VR enthusiasts, tech firms are hard at work looking to solve these problems. Among the potential solutions: A technology called “inside-out tracking,” which uses sensors built into a VR headset to track a wearer’s movements rather than relying on external equipment. On a practical level, inside-out tracking could mean no more setting up external cameras, bumping into furniture, or having to stay within a designated zone while using a VR device. Intel, Microsoft and Facebook are all pursuing the technology. Read more: The Ultimate Virtual Reality Buyer’s Guide Intel’s efforts revolve around what it calls Project Alloy, an experimental VR headset. The device combines inside-out tracking technology with a design that houses all the requisite processing power internally, eliminating the need to be tethered to a powerful, expensive computer. Intel says it isn’t planning on launching Alloy as a consumer device. Rather, it’s working with developers to make their own headsets based on the hardware. Intel says the first fruit of that labor should arrive on store shelves by the holiday season, though further details, including exact pricing, haven’t been announced. “Many high-end [VR devices] require you to have an external tracking system,” says Intel’s Achin Bhowmik, who leads the company’s Perceptual Computing Group. “So that is difficult to use, and people need to get used to it . . . with Project Alloy, we realized an opportunity to resolve these issues.” Facebook, meanwhile, says it has developed a prototype headset that uses inside-out tracking and is completely wireless. Microsoft says it’s working with companies like HP, Dell and Lenovo to design VR accessories capable of inside-out tracking that will work with cheaper computers. HTC’s Vive headset, says Forrester analyst J. P. Gownder, offers “the best experience in VR” today, an opinion shared by many tech critics. Still, Gownder adds that “what they have not shown is a way to make that happen that is simple and affordable.” HTC’s VR device alone costs $800, provided you have a computer that can run it. But designs like Project Alloy could make VR more accessible while preserving the praiseworthy experience. It also claims to add new tricks, like a “merged reality” feature that blends the wearer’s physical surroundings with a digital experience. When playing a game, for example, Alloy could transform a nearby couch into a generator aboard an alien spaceship, preventing players from an accidental collision during gameplay without taking away from the virtual environment. Early impressions of Intel’s hardware suggest there are wrinkles to be ironed out, but the project remains very much in the experimental phase. Read more: Why Virtual Reality is About to Change the World Not to be outdone, HTC is working on ways to improve its own VR hardware. It recently unveiled a new tracker that can help real-world accessories better mesh with digital environments. In a sign of the VR industry’s sometimes complex web of partnerships, HTC is also working with Intel on wireless technology that both firms hope could end the need for movement-restricting wires. Inside-out tracking could introduce new problems just as it solves existing dilemmas. Going wireless raises questions about battery life, as these headsets won’t be able to draw power from a PC. Intel hopes Alloy will last multiple hours on a single charge, but that remains to be seen. (Graphics-intensive games will likely drain more power than, say, watching a VR movie.) What also remains unclear is whether or not these wireless headsets will be able to offer the graphics processing power of those attached to PCs. Gownder, the analyst, thinks PCs will continue to play an important role in providing high-quality VR for the foreseeable future. Content creators, meanwhile, may have to grapple with the newfound freedom of a cordless experience after years of designing more limited experiences. “It’s very difficult to shoot an entire scene that you can walk around in,” says Patrick Meegan, creative director at VR platform Jaunt. “You would have to shoot individual subjects, or two or three subjects at a time. It would be going further into the method of composing a scene that you would be more familiar with in game design.” While VR has yet to go mainstream, it’s clear that Silicon Valley is hard at work improving the technology in hopes of wider adoption. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, recently said he expects to spend $3 billion over the next decade to make VR more accessible — and that’s after his company bought Oculus for more than $2 billion. Still, Gownder believes it will take some time before we see massive improvements in the experience. “Star Trek: The Next Generation becomes the reference point,” says Gownder. “Everybody wants VR to be more like the Holodeck . . .We are in the early days.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4521986/playstation-vr-oculus-rift-htc-vive-samsung-gear-comparison-virtual-reality/", "http://time.com/4280792/htc-vive-review/", "http://time.com/3987022/why-virtual-reality-is-about-to-change-the-world/"], "sentiment_score": 0.14292143372500515, "subjectivity_score": 0.4563684034219747},

But Apple’s software updates for the iPhone, which the company usually reveals during its annual developer’s conference, are met with far less fanfare. This is largely because Apple’s new software releases, as important as they may be for keeping your iPhone fast and secure, have recently been minor upgrades. Apple’s iOS 8 introduced iCloud Drive for accessing files across multiple devices and a new Health app to house fitness data from several fitness apps; iOS 9 brought Apple’s streaming music service and a slightly improved version of Siri. While helpful, these additions didn’t alter the overall iPhone experience in a significant way. But Apple’s iOS 10 software, coming this fall, offers a more dramatic change. Most notably, it rethinks many of the iPhone’s core apps and services, like Siri and iMessage. If the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple’s next iPhone will offer only incremental upgrades in terms of hardware, a change from the company’s usual pace of delivering an overhauled handset every two years. But after testing a beta version of iOS 10 for the past few days — available to the public starting Thursday — it’s become clear that Apple’s next big change is in its software. Here’s what it’s like to use iOS 10. It’s important to keep in mind that we didn’t use the final version of iOS 10; Apple is still fine-tuning the update for its fall release. Also, since iOS 10 is such a large update, we only focused on the most significant changes. iMessage Apple’s new version of iMessage adds lots of new features, including integration with third party apps, handwritten messages, and replacing words with emojis, among other upgrades. (The app integrations will let you do things like send money via an iMessage and more.) Many of these additions, like HUGE TEXTS, feel like features I would only use sparingly to add emphasis to my messages. Other features look more helpful for day-to-day communication, like the ability to replace a word with an emoji by tapping it, the new Tapback function, and rich media links. Tapback allows you to add a reaction to a particular comment in a message. If someone sends a message that says, “I just ordered tickets for us,” you could post a little thumbs up symbol or a heart on that message rather than typing a full reply. The rich media links, meanwhile, make links shared in conversations look cleaner. My biggest concern before trying the refreshed iMessage was that it would feel too cluttered with new features. Thankfully, this isn’t the case. Composing an iMessage or regular text message feels exactly the same as it did in iOS 9. The extra features, accessed by tapping an arrow next to the text field, don’t interfere with typing. Photos Getting a big intelligence boost, the Photos app in iOS 10 scans your photo library to determine the subject matter of each image, letting you more easily search for specific images. Instead of just searching based on location or date, you’ll be able to type in specific queries to get results. It works like Google Photos, except the iPhone handles all of the computing on the device itself rather than working in the cloud. In the beta version of iOS 10, this worked fairly well. Typing in “cats” yielded photos of my pet, entering “sunset” pulled up images taken of the horizon as the sun was going down. But some of Apple’s sorting categories were strange. One grouping called “headgear,” for example, included selfies and photos of people wearing glasses, headphones, or VR headsets. While the latter three make sense for the category, I’m not sure how selfies got lumped into that section. The other major addition to Photos in iOS 10 is the Memories tab, which organizes photos taken in certain places and at specific times into albums. This was generally pleasant to browse through; photos from my weekend trips to Atlantic City and the Poconos were all neatly packaged together. But since Memories are primarily sorted by location and date, many of my compilations had the same name. I had about five Memories called “Manhattan,” for example, which isn’t particularly helpful. Widgets, lock screen and other apps As with Photos, Apple’s other apps are generally smarter in iOS 10. That has the effect of making the iPhone feel more like a true digital assistant. Along those lines, one of the biggest changes you’ll notice in iOS 10 is that the”Siri Suggestions” feature, which surfaces app recommendations and nearby points of interest, has been merged with the “Today” tab, which shows upcoming appointments and other info via customizable widgets. The combined tab is now accessible by swiping to the right on the home screen, lock screen, or notifications panel. Each widget is the same size, resulting in a look that’s more streamlined and digestible than the old Today view. At first glance, it’s reminiscent of Google’s Android system. Indeed, the changes will be welcomed by iPhone users clamoring for more customization options, long a strong point of Android devices. Eagled-eyed iPhone users will notice another big change, this one on the lock screen. The iconic “slide to unlock” animation, which previously had Apple and rival Samsung embroiled in a patent dispute, is gone. Sliding your finger over the screen will now pull up that aforementioned list of widgets rather than unlocking the device. Swiping in the other direction will launch the camera. (Apple has axed the tiny camera icon that previously sat in the lower right corner of the screen.) Apple has also revamped some of its stock apps. Apple Music, for instance, has a slick new appearance that allows for quicker access to your playlists and music library. The Clock app now has a bedtime feature meant to help you develop healthier sleeping habits. I told the app what time I’d like to wake up in the morning and how many hours of sleep I wanted to get, and it set a bedtime for me. The app can also send a notification to remind you to go to sleep 15 or 30 minutes before that time. (Though a bedtime reminder might be more stressful than it’s worth.) Apple Maps, long past its initial launch hiccups, is also much improved in iOS 10. Developers will be able to plug their services into Apple’s navigation app, allowing users to book restaurant reservations or call a Lyft without leaving the app. Other tweaks, like the ability to search for gas stations and restaurants while driving, help Apple Maps keep up with rival Google Maps. The new Apple Maps also proactively suggests places you might want to visit based on the events in your calendar, the time of day, and the places you’ve visited. In practice, the app only suggested places I had recently searched for — but I imagine it will improve before the official launch. Conclusion For the first time since iOS 7 was released in 2013, Apple has released a software update that almost feels like I’m using a new iPhone. From the redesign of notifications and widgets to improved apps, iOS 10’s enhancements make it easier to see relevant information with a quick glance. Most importantly, Apple is giving developers more access to its mobile platform than ever before, which should spark interesting new features yet to be designed. In some ways, Apple is playing catch up with iOS 10. Companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google have made similar enhancements to their virtual assistants, messaging platforms, and photo apps. Still, it’s enough to make the iPhone feel exciting again. The average iPhone user will want to wait until later this year, when iOS 10 is officially released, to give it a spin. But the more adventurous can try it right away.

Sure, everyone loves a masterfully poured tulip doodle in their morning brew, but there’s no need to photograph it for your friends — again. It’s alright, everyone runs out of photographic inspiration from time to time. But instead of boring your Instagram followers, up your game with the latest wave of photo art apps. Mostly leaning on hard-working artificial intelligence and neural networks deep in the back-end of the Internet — Google’s DeepDream being the big one — these apps can turn your pet pictures into Picaso-esque portraits or your selfies into a scene out of “Starry Night.” Don’t believe us? Check out the results of filtering the same image through the various apps below. They’re all works of art, no paint required. Prisma Of all these new art apps, Prisma may have turned the most heads since its release in late July. Specializing in pop art filtering, the free app can turn your profile pic into everything from paper art to pen and ink sketches in a tap. One-touch Facebook and Instagram sharing have helped spread the word about Prisma almost as fast as it renders artwork. Unfortunately, Prisma doesn’t take the time to educate users about the artists the app is aping, nor does it even give proper credit. That’s a shame because these looks are so much more than filters; they’re art movements. Get it now   Pikazo The only app on this list that isn’t free, Pikazo is every bit worth the $4.99 for art school flunkies. Taking a two tap approach to pairing your photos with artistic inspiration, the app’s interface takes a little getting used to, but it’s a powerful program backed by artificial intelligence that truly transforms your images. Sadly, if you want to get the most out of this program (and trust me, you do), you’ll end up paying even more than the app’s price. For instance, to download printable images at 10- or 20-inch sizes (an option competing apps don’t provide), plan on spending more. For downloading some of the more premium styles (like those inspired by the works of Henri Rousseau, for example), plan on spending more yet again. But Pikazo also releases new free styles every week, making it an app art Instagrammers and fans alike will return to again and again. Get it now Painnt Flexible, free, and full of options, Painnt is the photo processor for the perfectionist. With more than 50 effects as of this writing, the app packs a lot of inspiration. And with slider bars aplenty, you can tinker with your filters until you get the masterpiece of your dreams — an option that other apps in this list doesn’t provide. And as liberating as Painnt’s interface is, it can also frustrate starving artists who want to use some of its better effects, like the red-hot “Fire” filter that gives images a flame-like effect. To use the app’s top-shelf stuff, they have to pay to unlock the app. $.99 will open it up for a week, $1.99 for a month, or $9.99 for a year. While all the unlocks give users access to the entire app, there’s no way to just pay once. Get it now Artisto The only video app in this list, Aristo takes the basic principle of neural network photo processing and puts it to motion pictures. With 18 filters as of this writing, the free app has a very straightforward interface. You either record a video using the app’s camera function or pick one from your library. Then you apply the style of your choice and shazam, your baby’s first steps looks like an Art Nouveau masterpiece come to life. Though some photo processing apps take minutes to brush up an image, Aristo manages to make movies more or less in an instant. The downside to this app is that it’s entirely lacking in add-ons and options. For instance, you can’t remove the watermark, nor can you turn the videos into GIFs without extra software. Get it now BitCam Throwback styles are great, but there’s no need to go back to the 1890s for quality art when the 1990s will do just fine. BitCam, a free app designed to celebrate Iconfactory’s 20 years of pushing pixels, eschews high-powered artificial intelligence for old fashioned 16-bit processing (packed into the iPhone’s 64-bit architecture, thank goodness). The result: retro photos that’ll make your friends green with envy — except this shooter only operates in black and white. Well, that’s not exactly true. Color graphics will set you back $1.99, a worthwhile upgrade. One caveat: The app does its darnedest to stay true to the times, which means it doesn’t let you reprocess previously-taken images from your photo library. That’s a big downer. Get it now Malevich Simple but limited (compared to the other apps), Malevich gives users two options when it comes to turning their photos into pieces of art. The free app offers users a “light” mode, which is code for fast, free, and lower resolution; and a “pro” mode that delivers maximum quality. The styles are based on famous paintings, such as Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” and Jackson Pollack’s “Number 31,” but there are only eight of them, as of this writing. Despite the relatively few filters, Malevich’s rendering looks fantastic. Unfortunately the app is all about the upsell, sometimes throttling free creations to just one per day, while including only five free pro renders. The cost for more begins at $8 for 25 pictures. It looks like Malevich’s favorite color is green. Get it now Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.14119727172052757, "subjectivity_score": 0.5771567418369742},

In his hands: the new Apple iPhone 7 Plus with its new two-lens camera system. On assignment for TIME, the professional photographer and fisherman by trade was one of the first to get his hands on the new phone, testing it in one of America’s most stunning national parks. Arnold usually shoots with a DSLR, but for the purpose of this assignment, he left it at home – a first for him. “After two days of hiking over 20 miles and trudging deep into the slot canyons of the Zion National Park wilderness,” he tells TIME, “I fell mostly in love with how un-sore my back was after carrying along almost nothing with me on the journey except for a 6.6-ounce camera phone attached to a cheap selfie stick.” And the resulting images, he says, are stunning: “I’m impressed with the improvements from the iPhone 6s plus,” even if the new model, like most camera phones, still has a long way to go to catch up with DSLRs. Read more: iPhone 7 Review: Apple’s best iPhone ever, but just barely For Arnold, the addition of a second lens in the iPhone 7 Plus is the feature that makes all the difference. “Digital zooming with a camera phone is a horrible idea and the quality of the image depreciates dramatically the further you zoom,” he says. “Having the option to use the additional lens means that portraits will be less distorted and of a higher quality. Also, you don’t have to worry as much about getting trampled by a bison or chomped by a grizzly when trying to get a headshot of your favorite wildlife with a camera phone.” It also helped that the two lenses on the iPhone 7 Plus – a 28mm and 56mm equivalent on a 35mm full-frame camera – mirror Arnold’s two favorite lenses when he’s shooting with his DSLR. Arnold was also impressed by the improvements in dynamic range and low-light shooting. “There tended to be more details in the shadows, and gradients in the highlights held up slightly better,” he says. “It is subtle, but the brighter, more colorful screen of the iPhone 7 Plus also made the images look a lot punchier and with more depth than the previous model. The new iPhone appears to have more shadow details and leans more reddish where as the iPhone 6s is more yellow and muddier in the shadows.” But there’s still room for improvement in low-light shooting situations, Arnold says, especially due to the lack of manual setting options when using the native camera mode. “For example, in the metadata I could see that there were times when low light made the image blurry as the shutter speed was lower to compensate,” he says. This could have been prevented if the aperture had been at its largest – in this case f/1.8 – and ISO had been at its highest. “I think there should be an shutter-priority or aperture-priority option [in the native camera app] for the more savvy camera users,” he adds. Overall, though, Arnold was pleasantly surprised by the results. “I’m quite happy with the quality of the images for use on the web and relieved that the fully automatic operation of the iPhone can result in such stunning pictures with very little technical knowhow,” he says. But for his exhibition prints, he’ll continue to rely on his DSLR for now. Corey Arnold is a photographer and commercial fisherman based in Portland, Oregon. Follow him on Instagram @arni_coraldo.

The new model will have a refreshed water-resistant design without a headphone jack, a force-sensitive home button, and a new glossy finish. The larger iPhone 7 Plus model also features two separate camera lenses. The iPhone 7 will start at $649 while the iPhone 7 Plus will be available from $749. Both phones will come in 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB options, with Apple notably cutting the 16GB storage option. Pre-orders begin on Sept. 9 and the phone will begin shipping on Sept. 16. Apple’s iPhone 7 will be available in two new finishes: black and jet black, the latter of which has a glossy look. Apple has also made the antenna on the back of the phone less visible to create a more seamless aesthetic. Apple will also be releasing a new version of its EarPod earbuds that connect to the new iPhone via the Lightning connector. These new EarPods and a dongle for connecting older headphones to the iPhone 7 will be included along with the new iPhone. The new camera system in the iPhone 7 will allow 50% more light to hit the sensor. The 12-megapixel sensor is also said to be faster and more efficient, and both models will include optical image stabilization. Apple calls this new camera system a “supercomputer” for photos: the iPhone 7’s new image signal processor can use machine learning to read the scene and adjust accordingly, the company says. The iPhone 7 Plus’ dual lens setup includes a wide angle lens and telephoto lens, which will allow it to capture high quality images even while zooming, Apple says. Thanks to a combination of the telephoto lens and the iPhone 7 Plus’ software, owners should be able to shoot sharp photos with up to a 10x zoom, according to Apple. The new processor that powers the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, called the A10 Fusion, is said to be 40% faster than the A9 chip in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. It’s also twice as fast as the processor inside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Apple says that tools like the mobile version of Adobe’s Lightroom software will be able to run smoothly on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus thanks to this new processor. The new iPhones are also said to have longer lasting batteries than any other iPhone, offering up to two hours of extra mileage compared to last year’s model. Apple has made improvements to the screens on its new iPhones as well. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are said to have screens that are 25% brighter than that of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The new iPhones will also be the first to include stereo speakers, which Apple calls a “huge jump forward” in terms of audio quality. The version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that launches in Japan will also include FeliCa, a version of NFC technology that’s standard in the country.

The company announced its new Moto Z2 Force phone on Tuesday, which comes with an ostensibly durable screen, two rear cameras and a magnetic connector for attaching accessories. The phone will be available on all major U.S. carriers starting at $30 per month, with preorders beginning Tuesday ahead of its August 10 launch. The phone’s 5.5-inch screen includes Motorola’s ShatterShield technology baked in, which the company claims makes it impervious to fractures and shatters. This isn’t the first time Motorola has made such claims — the phone’s predecessor also came with the same type of protection. Motorola dropped the older Droid Force on a concrete block during its unveiling in 2015 to prove that it wouldn’t break. Otherwise, Motorola’s new phone shares a few traits with the Essential phone, made by Android creator Andy Rubin. Like the Essential phone, Motorola’s device will come with two rear-facing cameras, one with a color sensor and the other monochrome. Each camera will have a 12-megapixel sensor, while Essential’s packs 13-megapixels. Motorola says the dual camera arrangement will make it possible to add blur to the background or foreground of an image, an effect we’ve seen in the iPhone 7 Plus’ portrait mode. The Moto Z2 Force, like the older Moto Z, will also include the Moto Mods port for connecting accessories specifically designed for the phone. Motorola has unveiled new Moto Mods in recent months, including one that turns the phone into a handheld gaming console and a wireless charging shell. On Tuesday, the company announced another new add on: a $300 360-degree 4K camera attachment. Essential sells a similar attachment for its own phone, which costs $200. And like many flagship Android phones, including Samsung’s Galaxy S8, the Essential phone and OnePlus 5, the Moto Z2 Force is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor. All told, the Moto Z2 Force would seem to offer modest but notable improvements over its predecessor. It also appears to be a solid alternative to the Essential phone, which will only be available through Sprint at launch.

{"type": "article", "header": "This New Android Phone Is Like One Massive Screen", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "February 26, 2017 7:00 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4682193/lg-g6-release-specs-2017/", "text": "If I were to ask for a smartphone that’s smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus but has a bigger screen, most electronics store clerks would probably think I was asking them to answer a riddle. But that’s exactly what LG sought to do with its new Android phone, the G6, which has a 5.7-inch screen that occupies nearly the entire face of the device. Since the borders around the G6’s screen barely exist, LG was able to fit a 5.7-inch display on a phone that feels more compact than most big phones, including Apple’s. Samsung pulled off a similar trick in the past with its line of Galaxy Edge smartphones, which includes a display that curves around the side of the phone, providing more screen real estate than standard models. LG similarly eliminated the side bezels with its G6, but instead it kept every inch of screen on the front of the phone rather than stretching it over the edges. (LG has not yet announced pricing or availability for the G6.) As such, the G6’s screen is slightly longer than that of most phones, resulting in an 18 x 9 aspect ratio compared to the more common 16 x 9. LG claims this makes for a more pleasant viewing experience, but it’s unclear exactly how much content is optimized to fit that screen shape. LG also pointed out that certain Netflix shows, like House of Cards and Stranger Things, were filmed to fit those proportions. During the brief time I had with the device, apps and web pages fit the screen just fine. LG appears to be catering the G6 to those who watch a lot of video, as the G6 will also support both HRD 10 and Dolby Vision standards for HDR content. HDR, which stands for High Dynamic Range, improves contrast ratio and color accuracy on screens. LG’s new phone packs another feature less common on most Androids: the Google Assistant. Google’s Pixel lineup are currently the only phones available that has the company’s virtual helper built-in, although Huawei says it plans to bring Amazon’s Alexa to its Mate 9 phone sometime this quarter. Both the G6’s 5-megapixel front camera and 13-megapixel main camera will feature a wide angle lens, with the back camera slightly broader at 125 degrees versus the selfie cam’s 100 degree lens. There’s also a second standard lens 13-megapixel camera on the back of the phone. LG is adding a new capture mode that takes advantage of the phone’s elongated screen as well. When snapping a photo, the camera viewfinder will appear on one side of the display while the captured picture is displayed on the other, making it easier to see how photos look without having to switch between the gallery and camera. The phone also inherits some design staples from its predecessors, such as its rear-mounted home button. But this year’s model is IP68 certified, meaning it can withstand being submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes. One downside, however, is that the silver model includes a spun metal aesthetic that makes it look more like a home appliance than a gadget. LG says the G6’s battery should be able to charge up to 50% in 35 minutes. If the phone’s larger screen proves to be as useful as LG claims, the G6 could give rivals like Samsung and HTC tough competition in the Android market. Samsung, however, is rumored to be working on a similar display for its upcoming flagship Galaxy S8 device, which may be revealed as early as next month.

The good: Beautiful screen, long battery life, helpful iris scanner for unlocking the phone, better multitasking The bad: Live Focus camera isn’t as good as Apple’s Portrait Mode, facial recognition is unreliable, not significantly different than Galaxy S8 and S8+ though more expensive Who should buy: Android fans that really care about having a stylus and two cameras should opt for the Note 8, but the Galaxy S8+ offers similar features at a lower price. Each year near summer’s close Samsung releases a new top-of-the-line Android-powered Galaxy Note phone. It’s typically a showcase for the best the industry has to offer, like bold new screens, longer battery life, a superb camera and apps designed to tout these touch-ups. Then, like clockwork, Apple follows with a new iPhone that matches or surpasses Samsung’s Note in key areas. 2017 is shaping up to be no different. With its massive edge-to-edge screen, facial recognition system and dual camera, Samsung’s $929 Galaxy Note 8 — out September 15 and the first new Note since last year’s ill-fated Note 7 — is a shot across Apple’s bow as anticipation soars for Cupertino’s 10th anniversary iPhone. Innovations in mobile design have slowed in recent years, with firms tweaking features instead of radically rethinking them. The Note 8 sprints ahead with refinements that show us where these devices are going. If the Note 8 looks familiar, it should: it’s nearly identical to the Galaxy S8+ Android phone Samsung released in April. The Note 8 has a wider body and sharper corners, but the phones are otherwise almost impossible to tell apart. That’s a departure from form. While the Galaxy S and Note families have gradually converged, the Note’s larger screens have made it the go-to mobile for fans of phablets: devices that straddle the ergonomic turf between a phone and tablet. But large screens are increasingly common. Case in point, the Note 8’s 6.3-inch display is a negligible 0.1 inches larger than the Galaxy S8+’s. That being said, the Note 8’s sharp OLED (organic light emitting diode) screen is just as impressive as the one found on Samsung’s S8 and S8+. The display looks magnificent against the phone’s barely-there black bezels, giving it a slicker look than the iPhone 7 Plus as well as Google’s Pixel. Better yet, the Note 8 manages this gorgeous look while folding in water resistance, a 3.5mm headphone jack and support for microSD card storage. Among the most noticeable differences between the Note 8 and S8+ is its included S Pen stylus, which can be used for tasks like scribbling down notes, translating text and marking up screenshots. The Note 8’s S Pen feels as smooth and accurate as ever, and I found it most useful for jotting down to-do lists, then pinning them to my home screen. The phone’s software has evolved to better suit the Note 8’s form, too. You still have the same always-on display and edge side panel found on previous phones, but Samsung has done more to boost the Note 8’s productivity tricks. Instead of having to open and split two apps across the screen manually, for example, you can pin two apps such that they open simultaneously with a tap. Apple is adding similar functionality to its iPad with its iOS 11 update due this fall, but points to Samsung for making it possible first. How many ways do you need to unlock a smartphone? The Note 8 offers four: facial recognition, iris scanning, fingerprint detection, or typing in a password. Samsung already offers these features in the S8, so the Note 8 is effectively playing catchup. I had some consistency issues with the phone’s facial recognition: when it unlocked the phone immediately, it felt magical, but sometimes it would say there was no face detected. Whether that’s down to sensor issues with variable lighting or facial obstructions like all the different possible permutations of glasses, it’s still frustrating when it fails. The Note 8’s iris scanner by contrast was far more reliable in my experience. It was able to detect my irises almost every time, wearing glasses or no (although it does take a bit longer with glasses). And even with facial recognition’s quirks, I prefer both it and iris scanning to the Note 8’s fingerprint scanner, which is inconveniently placed near the camera, making it awkward to reach. But the Note 8’s crown jewel, and the one that distinguishes it from the Galaxy S8+, is its new camera. The phone comes with a dual camera setup that includes a wide angle and telephoto lens, each with 12-megapixel sensors and optical image stabilization. Samsung makes use of the Note’s new double camera by adding a Live Focus shooting mode, which is essentially the company’s answer to Apple’s Portrait Mode. With Live Focus enabled, you can make a subject appear sharper against a blurred background, giving pictures a cool cinematographic depth of field effect. It’s even possible to edit the level of blurriness before or after snapping a picture, a noteworthy step up from Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, which offers no such customization options. In practice, the Note 8 and Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus are capable of taking lovely outdoor photos in bright sunlight. But the Note 8 struggles with certain indoor lighting conditions in Live Focus mode. In one instance, a yellowish haze appeared in the upper right corner of a photo I took in our office. In another shot taken in my apartment, my subject looked slightly washed out. The Phone 7 Plus also does a better job blending the subject into backgrounds when shooting in Portrait Mode, compared with Samsung’s Live Focus mode. Take a look at the comparison shots below. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 iPhone 7 Plus In the shots above, both the Note 8 and iPhone 7 Plus were able to freeze a tree branch swaying in the wind and slightly blur the background to make it pop. While I was able to obscure the backdrop a bit more using the Note 8’s slider, I preferred the iPhone 7 Plus’ overall photo since the leaves’ green shade looked bolder and more vibrant than those in Samsung’s photo. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (low blur) Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (higher blur) iPhone 7 Plus (portrait mode) Samsung’s Note 8 did a great job at making the subject appear sharp and detailed in the above portrait. But the colors are washed out, making the subject look way too pale and adding a slightly yellowish tinge. The iPhone 7 Plus is much better at making the scene appear more natural as it looks in real life. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Google Pixel iPhone 7 Plus The case is similar in the shots above: The Note 8’s photo is good, but the iPhone 7 Plus’ looks a bit bolder. I did prefer the Note 8’s photo over the Pixel’s, however, since it did a better job at making the flower’s purple hue look more colorful. Separately, the Note 8 works just fine in low light conditions, offering shots that are bright enough while preserving detail. In my tests, it just barely outperformed the Google Pixel, but wasn’t quite as bright and sharp as the iPhone 7 Plus’ image. Samsung previously led in this category, offering photos with deeper colors and clearer details in dim situations than its competition. The camera on Samsung’s Note 8 is still great, it’s just that rivals like Apple and Google have caught up. Like the S8 and S8+, the Note 8 comes with Samsung’s new Bixby virtual assistant — a voice assistant designed to improve handsfree navigation. Swipe right from the main view and Bixby has its own screen where you can check stuff like the news, nearby places of interest, recently captured photos and the weather. As a voice assistant, Bixby works best when summoned to carry out tasks within apps. You can ask it to multiply numbers using the calculator app, for instance, or pull up photos from the gallery, just as with Siri or Google’s Assistant. But both Apple and Google’s virtual helpers have a better handle on context, answering questions like “Where should I go for lunch?” with suggested restaurants in the area, not just a list of search results. Like other virtual assistances, Bixby gets to know you better the more you use it. Since I’ve been using Siri and the Google Assistant longer than Bixby, they may be more accurate because they better “know” what I want from use. Either way, Bixby’s potential seems to be more as a multitasking time-saver, since Samsung focused on making it a faster means of navigating your phone, not an all-encompassing virtual butler. This all hinges on third-party app compatibility, of course, which remains a work-in-progress. The Galaxy Note family has long been acclaimed for its stellar battery life, and the Note 8 is no different. After 14 hours of moderate usage and a single night left on (but unused), the phone still had 19% charge. For moderate users, that’s plenty to get through a day and a half, though competitor’s are nipping at Samsung’s heels — in my experience Essential’s new Android phone lasted for about the same amount of time. Regardless, you won’t be left scrambling for an outlet with the Note 8. But the Note 8’s most important improvement involves shoring up an embarrassing deficit. Samsung has taken precautions to prevent last year’s Note 7 battery disaster from recurring by implementing a new eight point battery check during the Note 8’s manufacturing process. It’s also had the Note 8’s battery independently verified by the Underwriters Laboratories, an internationally recognized safety group. With its dazzling screen, long battery life and useful productivity features, Samsung’s Note 8 is a top notch smartphone. But it’s expensive, especially when the Galaxy S8+ has most of the same features but costs roughly $100 less. There just isn’t much that separates the Note from the flagship smartphones Samsung unveiled earlier this year. Between the Note 8 and the latest rumors surrounding Apple’s next iPhone, one thing seems clear: our smartphones are going to get smarter, bigger and harbor new sensors designed to streamline everyday tasks. And whatever happens when Apple’s next iPhone arrives in the coming weeks, the Note 8 offers a glimpse of that future right now. 4 out of 5 Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/coupons/samsung", "http://time.com/4526350/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-problems-overheating-fire/", "http://time.com/4918520/new-iphone-8-announcement-date/", "http://time.com/4743682/samsung-galaxy-s8-review/", "http://time.com/4487993/apple-iphone-7-review/", "http://time.com/4517121/google-pixel-phone-2016-specs/", "http://time.com/4833222/ios-11-public-beta-review/", "http://time.com/4506167/iphone-7-plus-features-portrait-mode/", "http://time.com/4917547/android-essential-phone-review/", "http://time.com/4643296/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-battery/", "http://time.com/4924178/iphone-8-specs-apple/"], "sentiment_score": 0.1599330390463395, "subjectivity_score": 0.4534739726611648},

The South Korea-based electronics maker will follow new protocols, such as a multi-layer safety measure and an eight-point battery safety check. It will additionally form a battery advisory group, the company announced during a press conference on Jan. 23. This group will be comprised of external advisers, academic and research experts, including professors from the University of Cambridge, University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University. Samsung has also published details about its eight-point battery safety check — a process that will include durability tests during which the batteries are overcharged and subjected to extreme temperatures, visual inspections, X-ray scans and a charging and discharging test. Other steps include examinations designed to ensure that there is no possibility of battery leakage, a test in which the battery is disassembled in order to inspect its quality, and a simulation that imitates accelerated consumer use cases. Samsung will also observe any changes in voltage throughout the manufacturing process. After conducting months-long investigations and tests of more than 200,000 devices and 30,000 batteries, Samsung concluded that the issues with it Note 7 stemmed from the way its batteries were designed and manufactured. The company also says that 96% of the three million Note 7 phones sold have been returned. Samsung recalled the Note 7 after it began receiving reports about the phone overheating, and in some cases catching fire, in September. The company is expected to launch its next smartphone this spring, marking its first major mobile product launch since the Note 7 incident.

{"type": "article", "header": "iOS 11 Gives the iPad a Much-Needed Speed Boost", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "June 26, 2017 4:00 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4833222/ios-11-public-beta-review/", "text": "As expected, Apple’s new software update for the iPhone and iPad is full of deceptively minor changes that make a powerful collective difference. Some of iOS 11’s new features are immediately noticeable, such as a brand new app for managing files, while others won’t be apparent unless you look for them, like the new document scanner that lets you quickly import documents to the Notes app. But if there’s one takeaway, it’s that Apple is finally acknowledging a point that Microsoft has been making for years: that tablets can be useful as office productivity tools. I had a chance to test the beta version of iOS 11, and can say that if it’s any indication of what the final iteration is going to look like when it launches this fall, it’s going to transform Apple’s tablets into much more capable work computers. A few examples: iPad owners will be able to pin more of their favorite apps at the bottom of the screen and access them with a quick swipe from anywhere in the operating system. When viewing two apps in split-screen mode, those apps will remain pinned beside each other, even after exiting and viewing them in the recent apps screen. The Control Center and app switcher have been given a fresh design that merges the two into one, making it possible to view settings shortcuts and recently used apps at the same time. And Apple is adding the ability to edit and customize these Control Center shortcuts, a useful feature Android has offered for years. That’s just a glimpse of what’s in store for the iPad with iOS 11. Taken together, they signal that Apple believes the future of tablets is in laptop-like productivity, even if the company seems dead set against the idea of merging its desktop and mobile operating systems as Microsoft has. Thus many of the updates in iOS 11 are designed to give your iPad a speed boost – not in the literal sense, but rather in ways that make your workflow easier and quicker. Some of these features are better executed than others, like the increasingly MacOS-like dock (of icon shortcuts along the iPad screen’s bottom), which rates high among the standouts. Having access to my most frequently used apps just by swiping up from the bottom of the display saves time as well as needless trips back to the home screen. The number of apps you can stick to the dock has also more than doubled: 13 compared to the six that were previously allowed, which seems almost superfluous. Alongside those apps you’ll find three additional ones (for a total of 16) that iOS 11 suggests based on your recent activity. This only differs on the 12.9-inch iPad, which is capacious enough to accommodate 15 apps plus 3 suggested for a total of 18.   Read more: How Microsoft is Stealing Apple’s Cool Factor Another critical time-saver is the new app switcher, which preserves your preferences when you pair one app with another in split-screen mode. Doing so lets you open two apps with a single tap, streamlining app launching in a way that highlights how stodgy and spatially unoptimized the old way feels on the iPad’s larger screen. The existing app switcher simply displays apps in paginated cards that you can flip through, whereas iOS 11’s new method lays them out in a thumbnail view alongside the Control Center. This lets you easily view currently open apps at a glance instead of having to flip through them. That said, I do miss having the option to quickly toggle settings like screen brightness or Wi-Fi functionality without being distracted from my current task. Since the new Control Center is interlocked with the app switcher, it hijacks the entire display, temporarily pulling you out of whatever you were doing. The grandest new addition though is the Files app, which as its name implies, acts as a hub for the documents on your iPad, whether they’re in the cloud or on the device. The app is split between two main tabs: “Recents” and “Browse.” The former shows the files you’ve opened most recently, while the latter lets you peruse files kept in apps like Google Drive, Box and Dropbox, as well as those stored on the iPad. Apple’s goal with Files is to make it easier to jump into projects you’ve been working on without having to juggle multiple apps. Third party service integration wasn’t functional in the beta version of Files, so I can’t say how efficient Apple’s new file explorer actually is. But it feels like an overdue productivity-angled addition that should help bring the iPad up to speed with Windows 10-based tablets like the Surface Pro. A few other trivial-seeming yet helpful iOS 11 enhancements include the Slide Over sidebar, which can now be moved to the left or right on the iPad’s display instead of being locked to one side. It’s not as adaptable as the floating apps companies like LG have offered on their smartphones for years, whereby users can move apps in separate windows anywhere on the screen as well as resize them, but the extra flexibility should be welcome. And as noted above, adding document scanning capabilities to iOS 11 feels like a vital productivity-focused move. The scanner was a bit laggy during my experience, perhaps owing to its beta status, but the resulting images were crisp and easy to read. Apple is also adding a new copy and paste feature sure to come in handy the next time you’re emailing a batch of vacation photos to friends or snaps of the kids to grandma. Instead of opening a blank email, searching for the photos you want to send, then selecting them, you simply hold one finger on a photo, tap the others you’re after to add them to the pile, then drag the bundle over the Mail app icon, and presto, a blank email opens with the bundle attached. Read more: Why Apple’s Latest Move is Huge News for the Future of Computing One of my complaints about the Apple Pencil thus far has been that iOS isn’t optimized to make better use of it. Outside of drawing, there’s little else you can do. By contrast, companies like Microsoft and Samsung have empowered their styluses to trigger shortcuts or other helpful operating maneuvers. With iOS 11, Apple is attempting to bridge this functionality gap. Tapping the Pencil to the lock screen will automatically launch a note, for instance, making it easier to jot down quick thoughts without fully unlocking the tablet and opening an app. Between iOS 11 and the recently refreshed iPad Pro models, Apple’s message seems clear: the iPad is a vital part of its ecosystem, slumping sales or no. The latest iteration of iOS feels like one of Apple’s boldest, and does much to make the iPad a competitive multitasking machine. It doesn’t fundamentally change what the iPad is — a mobile device powered by a mobile operating system that’s not meant to be an all-encompassing laptop replacement. But it brings the iPad closer to a plausible desktop experience than ever before.

That has made the forthcoming legislation the subject of fierce debate and lobbying, with opposing sides battling to ensure that its scope is either widened or narrowed. Lawmakers are close to agreeing on a draft version of the law, the Financial Times reported last week. After that, the law will progress to negotiations between the bloc’s member states and executive branch.  The E.U. Artificial Intelligence Act is likely to ban controversial uses of AI like social scoring and facial recognition in public, as well as force companies to declare if copyrighted material is used to train their AIs.  The rules could set a global bar for how companies build and deploy their AI systems as companies may find it easier to comply with E.U. rules globally rather than to build different products for different regions—a phenomenon known as the “Brussels effect.”  “The E.U. AI Act is definitely going to set the regulatory tone around: what does an omnibus regulation of AI look like?” says Amba Kak, the executive director of the AI Now Institute, a policy research group based at NYU. One of the Act’s most contentious points is whether so-called “general purpose AI”—of the kind that ChatGPT is based on—should be considered high-risk, and thus subject to the strictest rules and penalties for misuse. On one side of the debate are Big Tech companies and a conservative bloc of politicians, who argue that to label general purpose AIs as “high risk” would stifle innovation. On the other is a group of progressive politicians and technologists, who argue that exempting powerful general purpose AI systems from the new rules would be akin to passing social media regulation that doesn’t apply to Facebook or TikTok. Read More: The A to Z of Artificial Intelligence Those calling for general purpose AI models to be regulated argue that only the developers of general purpose AI systems have real insights into how those models are trained, and therefore the biases and harms that can arise as a result. They say that the big tech companies behind artificial intelligence—the only ones with the power to change how these general purpose systems are built—would be let off the hook if the onus for ensuring AI safety were shifted onto smaller companies downstream.  In an open letter published earlier this month, more than 50 institutions and AI experts argued against general purpose artificial intelligence being exempted from the E.U. regulation. “Considering [general purpose AI] as not high-risk would exempt the companies at the heart of the AI industry, who make extraordinarily important choices about how these models are shaped, how they’ll work, who they’ll work for, during the development and calibration process,” says Meredith Whittaker, the president of the Signal Foundation and a signatory of the letter. “It would exempt them from scrutiny even as these general purpose AIs are core to their business model.” Big Tech companies like Google and Microsoft, which have plowed billions of dollars into AI, are arguing against the proposals, according to a report by the Corporate Europe Observatory, a transparency group. Lobbyists have argued that it is only when general purpose AIs are applied to “high risk” use cases—often by smaller companies tapping into them to build more niche, downstream applications—that they become dangerous, the Observatory’s report states. “General-purpose AI systems are purpose neutral: they are versatile by design, and are not themselves high-risk because these systems are not intended for any specific purpose,” Google argued in a document that it sent to the offices of E.U. commissioners in the summer of 2022, which the Corporate Europe Observatory obtained through freedom of information requests and made public last week. Categorizing general-purpose AI systems as “high risk,” Google argued, could harm consumers and hamper innovation in Europe.  Microsoft, the biggest investor in OpenAI, has made similar arguments through industry groups that it is a member of. “There is no need for the AI Act to have a specific section on GPAI [general purpose AI],” an industry group letter co-signed by Microsoft in 2022 states. “It is … not possible for providers of GPAI software to exhaustively guess and anticipate the AI solutions that will be built based on their software.” Microsoft has also lobbied against the E.U. AI Act “unduly burdening innovation” through The Software Alliance, an industry lobby group that it founded in 1998. The forthcoming regulations, it argues, should be “assigned to the user that may place the general purpose AI in a high-risk use [case],” rather than the developer of the general purpose system itself. A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment. Representatives for Google did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication. Read More: The AI Arms Race Is Changing Everything The E.U. AI Act was first drafted in 2021, at a time when AIs were primarily narrow tools applied to narrow use-cases. But in the last two years, Big Tech companies have begun to successfully develop and launch powerful “general purpose” AI systems that can perform harmless tasks—like writing poetry—while equally having the capacity for much riskier behaviors. (Think OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Google’s LaMDA.) Under the prevailing business model that has since emerged, these big companies license their powerful general purpose AIs to other businesses, who will often adapt them to specific tasks and make them public through an app or interface. Read More: The New AI-Powered Bing Is Threatening Users. That’s No Laughing Matter Some argue that the E.U. has placed itself in a bind by structuring the AI Act in an outdated fashion. “The underlying problem here is that the whole way they structured the E.U. Act, years ago at this point, was by having risk categories for different uses of AI,” says Helen Toner, a member of OpenAI’s board and the director of strategy at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “The problem they are now coming up against is that large language models—general purpose models—don’t have an inherent use case. This is a big shift in how AI works.” “Once these models are trained, they’re not trained to do one specific thing,” Toner says. “Even the people who create them don’t actually know what they can and can’t do. I expect that it’s going to be, probably, years before we really know all the things that GPT-4 can and can’t do. This is very difficult for a piece of legislation that is structured around categorizing AI systems according to risk levels based on their use case.” Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502592/china-social-credit-score/", "https://time.com/6271657/a-to-z-of-artificial-intelligence/", "https://time.com/6255952/ai-impact-chatgpt-microsoft-google/", "https://time.com/6256529/bing-openai-chatgpt-danger-alignment/", "https://time.com/6256529/bing-openai-chatgpt-danger-alignment/"], "sentiment_score": 0.03245299313481132, "subjectivity_score": 0.45260264987537735},

We Need to Shut it All Down", "author": "Eliezer Yudkowsky", "update_date/publish_date": "March 29, 2023 6:01 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/", "text": "An open letter published today calls for “all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.” This 6-month moratorium would be better than no moratorium. I have respect for everyone who stepped up and signed it. It’s an improvement on the margin. I refrained from signing because I think the letter is understating the seriousness of the situation and asking for too little to solve it. Read More: AI Labs Urged to Pump the Brakes in Open Letter The key issue is not “human-competitive” intelligence (as the open letter puts it); it’s what happens after AI gets to smarter-than-human intelligence. Key thresholds there may not be obvious, we definitely can’t calculate in advance what happens when, and it currently seems imaginable that a research lab would cross critical lines without noticing. Many researchers steeped in these issues, including myself, expect that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die. Not as in “maybe possibly some remote chance,” but as in “that is the obvious thing that would happen.” It’s not that you can’t, in principle, survive creating something much smarter than you; it’s that it would require precision and preparation and new scientific insights, and probably not having AI systems composed of giant inscrutable arrays of fractional numbers. Without that precision and preparation, the most likely outcome is AI that does not do what we want, and does not care for us nor for sentient life in general. That kind of caring is something that could in principle be imbued into an AI but we are not ready and do not currently know how. Absent that caring, we get “the AI does not love you, nor does it hate you, and you are made of atoms it can use for something else.” The likely result of humanity facing down an opposed superhuman intelligence is a total loss. Valid metaphors include “a 10-year-old trying to play chess against Stockfish 15”, “the 11th century trying to fight the 21st century,” and “Australopithecus trying to fight Homo sapiens“. To visualize a hostile superhuman AI, don’t imagine a lifeless book-smart thinker dwelling inside the internet and sending ill-intentioned emails. Visualize an entire alien civilization, thinking at millions of times human speeds, initially confined to computers—in a world of creatures that are, from its perspective, very stupid and very slow. A sufficiently intelligent AI won’t stay confined to computers for long. In today’s world you can email DNA strings to laboratories that will produce proteins on demand, allowing an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms or bootstrap straight to postbiological molecular manufacturing. If somebody builds a too-powerful AI, under present conditions, I expect that every single member of the human species and all biological life on Earth dies shortly thereafter. There’s no proposed plan for how we could do any such thing and survive. OpenAI’s openly declared intention is to make some future AI do our AI alignment homework. Just hearing that this is the plan ought to be enough to get any sensible person to panic. The other leading AI lab, DeepMind, has no plan at all. An aside: None of this danger depends on whether or not AIs are or can be conscious; it’s intrinsic to the notion of powerful cognitive systems that optimize hard and calculate outputs that meet sufficiently complicated outcome criteria. With that said, I’d be remiss in my moral duties as a human if I didn’t also mention that we have no idea how to determine whether AI systems are aware of themselves—since we have no idea how to decode anything that goes on in the giant inscrutable arrays—and therefore we may at some point inadvertently create digital minds which are truly conscious and ought to have rights and shouldn’t be owned. The rule that most people aware of these issues would have endorsed 50 years earlier, was that if an AI system can speak fluently and says it’s self-aware and demands human rights, that ought to be a hard stop on people just casually owning that AI and using it past that point. We already blew past that old line in the sand. And that was probably correct; I agree that current AIs are probably just imitating talk of self-awareness from their training data. But I mark that, with how little insight we have into these systems’ internals, we do not actually know. If that’s our state of ignorance for GPT-4, and GPT-5 is the same size of giant capability step as from GPT-3 to GPT-4, I think we’ll no longer be able to justifiably say “probably not self-aware” if we let people make GPT-5s. It’ll just be “I don’t know; nobody knows.” If you can’t be sure whether you’re creating a self-aware AI, this is alarming not just because of the moral implications of the “self-aware” part, but because being unsure means you have no idea what you are doing and that is dangerous and you should stop. On Feb. 7, Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, publicly gloated that the new Bing would make Google “come out and show that they can dance.” “I want people to know that we made them dance,” he said. This is not how the CEO of Microsoft talks in a sane world. It shows an overwhelming gap between how seriously we are taking the problem, and how seriously we needed to take the problem starting 30 years ago. We are not going to bridge that gap in six months. It took more than 60 years between when the notion of Artificial Intelligence was first proposed and studied, and for us to reach today’s capabilities. Solving safety of superhuman intelligence—not perfect safety, safety in the sense of “not killing literally everyone”—could very reasonably take at least half that long. And the thing about trying this with superhuman intelligence is that if you get that wrong on the first try, you do not get to learn from your mistakes, because you are dead. Humanity does not learn from the mistake and dust itself off and try again, as in other challenges we’ve overcome in our history, because we are all gone. Trying to get anything right on the first really critical try is an extraordinary ask, in science and in engineering. We are not coming in with anything like the approach that would be required to do it successfully. If we held anything in the nascent field of Artificial General Intelligence to the lesser standards of engineering rigor that apply to a bridge meant to carry a couple of thousand cars, the entire field would be shut down tomorrow. We are not prepared. We are not on course to be prepared in any reasonable time window. There is no plan. Progress in AI capabilities is running vastly, vastly ahead of progress in AI alignment or even progress in understanding what the hell is going on inside those systems. If we actually do this, we are all going to die. Read More: The New AI-Powered Bing Is Threatening Users. That’s No Laughing Matter Many researchers working on these systems think that we’re plunging toward a catastrophe, with more of them daring to say it in private than in public; but they think that they can’t unilaterally stop the forward plunge, that others will go on even if they personally quit their jobs. And so they all think they might as well keep going. This is a stupid state of affairs, and an undignified way for Earth to die, and the rest of humanity ought to step in at this point and help the industry solve its collective action problem. Some of my friends have recently reported to me that when people outside the AI industry hear about extinction risk from Artificial General Intelligence for the first time, their reaction is “maybe we should not build AGI, then.” Hearing this gave me a tiny flash of hope, because it’s a simpler, more sensible, and frankly saner reaction than I’ve been hearing over the last 20 years of trying to get anyone in the industry to take things seriously. Anyone talking that sanely deserves to hear how bad the situation actually is, and not be told that a six-month moratorium is going to fix it. On March 16, my partner sent me this email. (She later gave me permission to excerpt it here.) “Nina lost a tooth! In the usual way that children do, not out of carelessness! Seeing GPT4 blow away those standardized tests on the same day that Nina hit a childhood milestone brought an emotional surge that swept me off my feet for a minute. It’s all going too fast. I worry that sharing this will heighten your own grief, but I’d rather be known to you than for each of us to suffer alone.” When the insider conversation is about the grief of seeing your daughter lose her first tooth, and thinking she’s not going to get a chance to grow up, I believe we are past the point of playing political chess about a six-month moratorium. If there was a plan for Earth to survive, if only we passed a six-month moratorium, I would back that plan. There isn’t any such plan. Here’s what would actually need to be done: The moratorium on new large training runs needs to be indefinite and worldwide. There can be no exceptions, including for governments or militaries. If the policy starts with the U.S., then China needs to see that the U.S. is not seeking an advantage but rather trying to prevent a horrifically dangerous technology which can have no true owner and which will kill everyone in the U.S. and in China and on Earth. If I had infinite freedom to write laws, I might carve out a single exception for AIs being trained solely to solve problems in biology and biotechnology, not trained on text from the internet, and not to the level where they start talking or planning; but if that was remotely complicating the issue I would immediately jettison that proposal and say to just shut it all down. Shut down all the large GPU clusters (the large computer farms where the most powerful AIs are refined). Shut down all the large training runs. Put a ceiling on how much computing power anyone is allowed to use in training an AI system, and move it downward over the coming years to compensate for more efficient training algorithms. No exceptions for governments and militaries. Make immediate multinational agreements to prevent the prohibited activities from moving elsewhere. Track all GPUs sold. If intelligence says that a country outside the agreement is building a GPU cluster, be less scared of a shooting conflict between nations than of the moratorium being violated; be willing to destroy a rogue datacenter by airstrike.  Frame nothing as a conflict between national interests, have it clear that anyone talking of arms races is a fool. That we all live or die as one, in this, is not a policy but a fact of nature. Make it explicit in international diplomacy that preventing AI extinction scenarios is considered a priority above preventing a full nuclear exchange, and that allied nuclear countries are willing to run some risk of nuclear exchange if that’s what it takes to reduce the risk of large AI training runs. That’s the kind of policy change that would cause my partner and I to hold each other, and say to each other that a miracle happened, and now there’s a chance that maybe Nina will live. The sane people hearing about this for the first time and sensibly saying “maybe we should not” deserve to hear, honestly, what it would take to have that happen. And when your policy ask is that large, the only way it goes through is if policymakers realize that if they conduct business as usual, and do what’s politically easy, that means their own kids are going to die too. Shut it all down. We are not ready. We are not on track to be significantly readier in the foreseeable future. If we go ahead on this everyone will die, including children who did not choose this and did not do anything wrong. Shut it down.

Because the iPhone 7 Plus has two lenses, one standard and one telephoto, it’s able to produce crisper zoomed-in shots. And there’s more: The iPhone 7 Plus will soon add another feature called Portrait Mode, which Apple unveiled during its iPhone 7 launch event earlier this month. It’ll come solely to the larger iPhone 7 in a software update later this year. Portrait Mode adds a depth effect that makes images in the foreground appear sharp against a slightly blurred background, as shown in the images below. Photographers call this effect “bokeh.” It’s commonly used in portrait photography to isolate subjects from their backgrounds. Smartphones haven’t traditionally been able to make photographs like these because of their hardware limitations. But the iPhone 7 produces a Bokeh-like effect by using both of its camera lenses in combination with machine learning software that separate the foreground from what’s behind it. Portrait Mode hasn’t yet officially arrived on the iPhone 7 Plus. But an early, unfinished version of it is present in Apple’s latest beta software release, iOS 10.1, which I’ve had the chance to briefly experiment with. Below are some sample images and thoughts: When using the iPhone’s default camera app, you’ll find the Portrait Mode button located just above the shutter button, along with the iPhone’s other capture modes. Once your iPhone is set to Portrait, the camera will analyze the scene and try to apply its depth-of-field effect to a subject. You’ll see a preview in the camera viewfinder before capturing the shot. The camera won’t apply the depth effect unless the conditions are just right. If the lighting is too dim or if you’re too close or far from your subject, the camera will alert you so you can adjust accordingly. That’s because these factors play a big role in determining how noticeable the depth effect will be in the resulting image. The further a subject is from what’s in the background, the more pronounced and sharp it looks compared to the rest of the photo. If a subject is too dim, you run the risk of capturing a grainy shot. In my experience, these warnings appeared most often when I was trying to shoot indoors. While using this mode, you can still tap the screen to focus on a specific subject and adjust the exposure as normal. The iPhone captures two images when Portrait mode is turned on: one with the depth effect applied, and one without it. Features like Portrait Mode aren’t likely to replace DSLR-quality photos anytime soon, but it does give smartphone photographers more tools in their toolkit. HTC also released a similar feature for its One M8 phone back in 2014, but hasn’t revived this capability on any of its newer handsets. For now, Portrait Mode works best when used outside in natural lighting while photographing a subject against a far-off background. The popularity of photo-editing apps like Instagram, VSCO, and Snapseed show that there’s huge demand for anything that improves smartphone photos. It’s nice to see Apple build more features like these directly into the iPhone’s camera system.

The Pixel will have a 5-inch screen, while the larger model will include a 5.5-inch display. The Pixel is available for preorder immediately. The lineup starts at $649, or $27 per month. Verizon is the exclusive carrier partner in the United States, though Google is also selling unlocked versions directly to customers. These are the first Google-branded phones that were designed solely by the company. This marks a new approach for Google, which typically outsources the design and production of its branded devices to other smartphone makers like HTC and LG. Those Google phones were previously given the “Nexus” moniker. Read more: Google’s new phones are exactly what Android needs right now The way Google created its new Pixel devices is similar to the way Apple develops its iPhones. Apple designs its smartphones in-house, while outside manufacturers takes care of assembling the components. Rick Osterloh, Google’s hardware chief, said building its own hardware allows Google to “take full advantage of capabilities like the Google Assistant,” the company’s new virtual aide. “This is a natural step and we’re in it for the long run,” Osterloh said during the event. The Pixel has a more premium design that some of Google’s previous Nexus phones, with a glass-covered back and polished aluminum casing. It will also be among the first smartphones to include Google’s new Google Assistant, a Siri-like app activated by pressing and holding the home button or saying a trigger word. The Pixel will be available in three colors: Quite Black, Really Blue, and Very Silver. Google is also talking up the Pixel’s camera, which has a 12.3 megapixel sensor and an aperture of f/2.0. Users will be able to capture multiple photos at once with a new burst mode. The company claims it captures photos faster than any other smartphone it has tested, which would make it an ideal choice for snapping action shots. Pixel buyers will also get free unlimited photo and video storage at full resolution through the Google Photos app. Another new feature coming to the Pixel is quick charging, which has become increasingly popular on modern Android smartphones. The Pixel‘s quick charging capability will enable it to get seven hours worth of battery life after 15 minutes of charging, says Google. Buy here.

{"type": "article", "header": "Everything We Know About the Samsung Galaxy S8 So Far", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "February 22, 2017 10:16 AM [ET] | December 6, 2016 5:30 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4592308/samsung-galaxy-s8-specs-release-date-rumors/", "text": "Samsung is expected to unveil its first major smartphone since it recalled the Galaxy Note 7 as soon as March, according to the latest reports. The phone, which will presumably be called the Galaxy S8, is rumored to include a brand-new design, a smarter digital assistant, and a pressure sensitive screen, among other new additions. Tech pundits and investors will be eyeing this launch closely as Samsung looks to recover lost ground from the Note 7 fiasco. Here’s a look at what to expect based on the rumors and reports that have emerged so far. Two models Samsung’s next flagship will come in two different sizes, according to reports from The Guardian and VentureBeat. One model will have a 5.8-inch display, says VentureBeat, while the other will have a 6.2-inch screen. Previous generations of Samsung’s Galaxy S phones have also launched in two variants, but the company usually offers one with a curved screen and another model with a standard display. If VentureBeat’s information proves to be correct, these phones will be significantly larger than the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, which have 5.1 and 5.5-inch displays, respectively. Spring launch Samsung reportedly plans to introduce its new smartphones during an event in New York City on March 29, according to VentureBeat. Both phones are said to go on sale April 21. If true, it will mean Samsung will stray from its tradition of unveiling its new Galaxy smartphones during the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona, as it has done in years past. A previous report from The Wall Street Journal initially said Samsung’s launch may come as late as April. New design with “infinity” display One of the most distinguishing features that’s expected to debut on the S8 is a new edge-to-edge screen, which The Guardian calls an “infinity” display. The screens on both phones will reportedly curve over the edge of the device on both sides, similar to the Galaxy S7 Edge, and will cover most of the front of the phone, according to the report. Since Samsung reportedly plans to dedicate most of the phone’s front to screen real estate, the forthcoming phones won’t include a physical home button. The fingerprint scanner will instead be placed on the back of the device, similar to that of the Google Pixel. The most recent reports from The Guardian and VentureBeat also indicate that the Galaxy S8 will include a headphone jack in addition to a USB-C port. An earlier report from tech blog Sam Mobile said the Galaxy S8 would not include a headphone jack, mirroring a similar move by Apple with the iPhone 7. Iris scanner Samsung first introduced an iris scanner on its troubled Note 7, and reports from The Guardian and VentureBeat indicate it will reappear on the Galaxy S8. The Note 7’s iris scanner made it possible to unlock the phone without typing in a password or touching its fingerprint scanner. Improved virtual assistant The Galaxy S8 is expected to come with an AI assistant that works with the phone’s camera to recognize objects, reports The Guardian. Users may be able to use the camera to capture text and perform a web search based on that text, as VentureBeat cites as an example. Samsung may also be partnering with other companies to provide data for this virtual assistant. Reuters previously reported on Samsung’s plans to include a new virtual assistant in its next smartphone, adding that it intends to use technology from startup Viv Labs, which is acquired in October, in future Galaxy devices. The phone may also include a button along the side of the device for summoning the assistant, according to The Wall Street Journal. Samsung may name the virtual aide Bixby, as Sam Mobile reports. Apple, Amazon, and Google have also been working to enhance their own voice-activated assistants. Apple launched an update in September that enables iPhone owners to use apps like Uber and Venmo through Siri, making it possible to send cash or call a cab with one’s voice. Meanwhile, Amazon’s voice-controlled Alexa now works with more than 4,000 apps. Camera upgrades In addition to recognizing objects, the cameras on Samsung’s upcoming smartphones will reportedly include minor enhancements that improve image quality, low-light performance, and speed, as The Guardian Notes. Specifically, the devices are said to include a 12-megapixel main camera and an 8-megapixel front camera, says VentureBeat. An earlier report from Korean news outlet ETNews also indicates the front camera would come with an autofocus feature that makes it possible to capture subjects more clearly from a distance. This would likely result in higher-quality selfies, crucial as apps like Snapchat continue to grow in popularity. An older report from the same website also suggests the S8 may get a dual-lens rear camera, although newer reports from other news outlets haven’t corroborated either claim. Apple recently added a dual-lens camera to the iPhone 7 Plus, which helps it achieve a clearer zoom and enable a “portrait mode” effect that makes subjects appear sharp against a blurred background. Pressure-sensitive screen The Galaxy S8 may include a screen that reacts differently depending on how hard a user presses it, according to The Investor and VentureBeat. This may make it possible to zoom in on a photo or create app shortcuts by pressing harder on the screen, similar to the iPhone’s 3D Touch. The pressure-sensitive tech might only be present in the lower portion of the screen. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Samsung would add pressure-sensitive screen tech to the Galaxy S7, although Samsung has yet to release a phone with such a feature. Desktop computer functionality Samsung may release a new service and a dock accessory for the Galaxy S8 that enables it to function as an Android desktop computer, according to The Guardian. Based on the report, it sounds like this feature would work similarly to Microsoft’s Continuum, enabling the phone to connect to a keyboard, monitor, and other peripherals while acting as the brain of the computer setup. Performance and storage Smartphone shoppers can expect the Galaxy S8 to feel a bit faster than Samsung’s previous Galaxy S device. The new phones will be powered by processors based on Samsung’s new 10nm technology, according to The Guardian, which VentureBeat says should make them perform 11% faster than the S7 with graphics processing that’s 23% quicker. This performance boost will be especially important as Samsung continues to push into virtual reality. The new phones are also said to start with 64GB of storage instead of 32GB and will reportedly support an extra 256GB of space.

{"type": "article", "header": "This Android Phone Is the Perfect Samsung Note 7 Replacement", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "January 31, 2017 10:49 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4654407/huawei-mate-9-review-release-date-2017/", "text": "The good: Long battery life, Good camera with a wide range of controls, Easy to grip without a case The bad: Includes excessive apps, Not water and dust resistant, No virtual assistant at launch Who should buy: Android fans looking for a great large phone with long battery life. When Samsung recalled its Galaxy Note 7 last September, Android fans looking for a big-screened smartphone were left with few choices aside from Google’s Pixel XL. Enter Huawei’s Mate 9, which launched in the U.S. in early January. The Mate 9 packs a dual-lens camera co-engineered with Leica, a 5.9-inch screen, and a large, long-lasting battery. It’s a more than worthy competitor to similar phones from Apple, Samsung, and Google. Huawei’s device will also be the first smartphone to include Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant built-in, which will be added through a software update promised to arrive during the first quarter of this year. With Alexa, Mate 9 will be capable of handling many of the same tasks as the Amazon Echo. Users will be able to ask Alexa simple questions, control smart home devices, or even order a pizza with their voice. Available for $600 through Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, and B&H, the Mate 9 is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile’s networks. Here’s a closer look at what it’s like to use. How it looks and feels There’s little that distinguishes Huawei’s Mate 9 from other high-end smartphones in terms of appearance, but that’s not necessarily a negative. Made of metal and glass, the phone looks sleek and is surprisingly easy to grip (the iPhone, I’ve found, sometimes feels a bit slippery without a case.) The borders along the side of the display are also notably thin, allowing for more screen real estate without increasing the device’s overall size. The Mate 9 lacks a physical home button and instead includes navigation keys that appear on screen as needed, like many Android phones. Thus, the fingerprint sensor is located on the back of the device, as is the case with the Google Pixel. This means you’ll have to pick up your phone whenever you want to unlock it using the fingerprint scanner, which can be bothersome for some. That being said, the sensor detects your fingerprint impressively fast. Using it Huawei’s Mate 9 shares one of the best tricks of Google’s latest handsets: You can choose to use the circular fingerprint scanner as a touchpad for the notification panel. Swiping down will cause the alert pane to drop down from the top of the screen, while swiping up dismisses it. It’s a helpful shortcut that makes it easier to use such a massive phone with one hand. The Mate 9 also supports a split-screen mode that makes it possible to view more than one app at the same time. Certain other large-screen Android phones, such as Samsung’s Galaxy Note devices, also have this ability. If you’re curious about what really differentiates the Mate 9 from its Android rivals, look to its hardware, not software. Thanks to a Huawei algorithm, the phone learns a user’s habits and allocates its processing resources accordingly. Huawei’s Mate 9 certainly offers speedy performance: whether I was checking email, playing games with demanding graphics, or browsing the web via Chrome using multiple tabs, I never experienced any lag. But it’s impossible to determine if the Mate 9 truly lives up to all of Huawei’s claims without using it for several months to check for performance slowdowns over time. The software, meanwhile, includes the most commons staples seen on Android devices, such as a variety of settings shortcuts that become accessible when pulling down from the top of the screen. However, the Mate 9 is also pre-loaded with a hefty number of apps, including Booking.com, CNN, TripAdvisor and more. The app overload made the phone feel cluttered right out of the box. Smartphone shoppers worried about losing their headphone jack need not worry about the Mate 9: Huawei’s phone includes both a USB-C port for charging and a standard 3.5mm audio slot for plugging in headphones. The device comes with 64GB of storage; users can add up to 256GB via a microSD card. Battery life If you’re one of those people who can’t bear to get through a workout without Spotify or are totally lost without Google Maps, you know how valuable long battery life can be in a smartphone. The Mate 9’s large battery (4,000 mAh in capacity compared to the Galaxy S7 Edge’s 3,600 mAh battery, Google Pixel XL’s 3,450 battery, and the iPhone 7 Plus’ 2,900 mAH battery) completely delivers on this front. I’ve been using it for about 13 hours and the battery has only drained by 50%. And that’s just on normal usage without the power savings mode turned on. Battery life will always vary depending on how you use your phone (using apps that rely on location data, constantly fetching email from the server, leaving Bluetooth turned on, and cranking up your phone’s screen brightness can all drain battery more quickly). During my time with the Mate 9, I’ve primarily used the device for my usual daily tasks like checking email and using Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram in addition to playing games and streaming media from YouTube and Spotify. I occasionally turned on Bluetooth to use wireless headphones, and often left the brightness set to auto. If that sounds a lot like your daily routine, you can expect similar results from the Mate 9. The camera With its Mate 9, Huawei aims to prove that photographers don’t need a dedicated digital camera to get tighter control over their shots. The phone includes a Leica dual-lens camera with a 12-megapixel RGB sensor and a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor. The former is for rendering bold colors, while the later is designed to catch detail, Huawei says. The Mate 9’s camera software is loaded with goodies photography nuts will appreciate, such as a Pro mode that lets users tinker with ISO levels and other settings. A variety of shooting styles are available as well, many of which have become common on smartphones, such as a mode that airbrushes selfies and a Night Mode. One of the rarer of these modes is Light Painting, which uses a long exposure to help users capture flashlight artwork that’s all the rage on Instagram. The Mate 9’s camera is undoubtedly good. But the question isn’t whether or not it offers great image quality; it’s whether or not it can outperform rival phones made by Apple, Samsung, and Google, all of which have boasted about their smartphones’ superior camera features in recent years. The answer is complicated and largely depends on the conditions in which you’re shooting. Huawei’s phone is generally great at nailing the right lighting and displaying bold yet natural colors across the board. When capturing a close-up photo of a deep red branch, for example, the Mate 9 produced the best combination of punchy color and lighting that didn’t wash out the scene, and it was able to focus on the subject quickly. In a separate photo overlooking New York’s East River, however, I noticed that the Mate 9’s photo wasn’t quite as detailed in some areas as the pictures snapped by its rivals. The ripples in the water, for instance, are more defined in the photo taken with the iPhone 7 Plus. Check out these samples: Huawei Mate 9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Google Pixel XL Huawei Mate 9   Apple iPhone 7 Plus   Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Google Pixel XL In dim conditions, the Mate 9’s camera performs fairly well even without Night Mode turned on. When shooting a photo in an indoor area with low little to no lighting, I was still able to see my subject’s face with some detail. In general, smartphone cameras have gotten better at taking pictures in poorly lit circumstances: the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Galaxy S7 Edge all captured acceptable photos in the same environment. But the Mate 9’s images offered the best mix of lighting and detail, with Samsung coming in as a close second (although the Galaxy S7 Edge’s photo was brighter, it wasn’t quite as sharp.) The Mate 9 is also capable of capturing photos with a “bokeh” effect, which blurs the background while keeping the main subject crisp, similar to the iPhone 7 Plus’ Portrait Mode. What Huawei offers that Apple doesn’t, however, is the ability to fine-tune the background’s blurriness after the photo has been taken. My one complaint about this feature is how difficult it was to find; you need to tap the Wide Aperture icon toward the top of the screen to get it to work, while many of the phone’s other shooting modes are accessible by swiping to the right. Conclusion Huawei’s new flagship smartphone shines in all the right places, with its long lasting battery life, sharp camera, and attractive looks. There are some areas where it falls behind the competition: it’s not water and dust resistant, and it includes some unnecessary apps which can make the interface feel cluttered. Regardless, it’s clear that Huawei focused on the core features that matter most, not gimmicks, which is sure to please most buyers. When its Alexa voice assistant launches, the Mate 9 will be an even more tempting choice for Android fans. 4 out of 5 stars (Read TIME’s affiliate link policy.)

{"type": "article", "header": "This New Android Is Like the Swiss Army Knife of Phones", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "July 21, 2016 9:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4415907/moto-z-review-price-release-date/", "text": "The good: Super thin and attractive design, Moto Mods are easy to use, Snappy performance. The bad: Bloatware, Sometimes runs hot. Who should buy: Android fans looking for a customizable, premium smartphone. Smartphones have already taken on the role of digital wallet, camera, pocket-sized newspaper, and portable game console. But some companies are trying to further add to their capabilities, offering so-called “modular” phones that gain new features with the help of added accessories. Motorola is the latest phone maker to jump on this trend. Its new Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Force Droid phones are compatible with a special line of accessories designed to connect to the phones’ back panel. The earliest of these so-called “Moto Mods” can transform either phone into a portable projector, a speaker system, or simply give the devices extra battery life. The Verizon-exclusive Moto Z and Moto Z Force, which cost $624 and $720 respectively without a payment plan and are available for preorder starting Thursday, come as Motorola’s competitors have announced phones with similar capabilities. LG’s G5 works with components like a larger battery or camera grip, while Google plans to develop a shape-shifting phone with modules that can be pulled apart like LEGOs. Moto Mods In practice, the Moto Mods work almost like a regular phone case. But instead of fidgeting with the phone to fit it in a frame, mods snap easily onto the back of the phone. Accessories connect to the phone’s back panel via magnets, allowing them to communicate with the device without any complicated setup. That makes using them easier than adding accessories to the LG G5, which requires some tugging at the phone’s base. To get the projector up and running on my Moto Z, I simply snapped it on to the phone, held down the projector’s power button to turn it on, and fired up Netflix to project TV shows onto my wall. The projection size is automatically adjusted depending on the surface it’s being aimed at. After some toggling, the picture displayed on my bedroom wall looked crisp and clear. My experience using the JBL speaker was similar: just snap and go. The add-on gave the Moto Z’s audio a big boost, making it much more pleasant to listen to music without headphones. There’s also an integrated kickstand in the speaker Mod, which came in handy while watching Netflix. Tumi’s power pack Mod, meanwhile, is noticeably slimmer than most battery cases, making it a solid option for those seeking extra power without added bulk. To get these add-ons, you’ll have to pay $299.99 for the Moto Insta-Share Projector, $79.99 for the JBL SoundBoost, or between $59.99 and $89.99 for a power pack made by Tumi or Kate Spade. Using it For general use, the Moto Z and its more expensive Force sibling are perfectly adequate. The two phones differ in a few important ways: the Moto Z Force has a screen that Motorola says is shatter-resistant, its battery is larger than that of the Moto Z, its main camera has a higher resolution, and the Force model is generally thicker and heavier. Meanwhile, the Moto Z stands out for its incredibly thin and lightweight frame, which feels sleeker than any phone I’ve tested this year. At 5.19 millimeters, it’s slimmer than most flagship phones, including Apple’s iPhone 6s, which measures 7.1 millimeters. This is especially important for the Moto Z, as a large part of its appeal hinges on attaching accessories that come with the cost of extra bulk. The one exception to the Moto Z’s svelte physique is its camera, which juts out from the back of the device line a knob. (Moto Mods have a circular cutout to accommodate this.) The Moto Z’s thinness comes with an important tradeoff: There’s no headphone jack. Both phones only contain a single USB Type C port; plugging in headphones requires an adapter. (Another hangup: The phone had the tendency to get hot after just a few minutes of use.) The Moto Z’s interface is straightforward and will feel familiar to most Android users. Its biggest shortcoming, though, is that it comes preloaded with more than a dozen apps that I’ll likely never use. These extraneous pieces of software — called bloatware — can be bothersome for those like myself who prefer a neater aesthetic. My Moto Z’s app drawer was crowded with seven Verizon apps in addition to a few other games and services I don’t use. Although the Force model has a 21-megapixel main camera compared to the slimmer Moto Z’s 13-megapixel shooter, I didn’t see much of a difference when comparing photos captured on both phones side by side. While the images taken with the Moto Z devices looked sharp and crisp, I noticed that photos taken on Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge and iPhone 6s Plus boasted richer colors. The Moto Z’s battery lasted for more than a day, which is on par with what I’ve experienced on premium smartphones. After nearly 24 hours of using the device sporadically to play games, browse the web, check social media, and take photos, my Moto Z’s battery was at about 20%. Conclusion Motorola’s Moto Mods offer more flexibility than most smartphone accessories, allowing Moto Z and Moto Z Force owners to easily bolster the phone’s abilities or add new features altogether. The Mods’ most impressive aspect is that they just work. Clicking a Moto Mod into place instantly turned my phone into a projector without any cables or hassle. For many, though, the Mods may not be compelling enough to make the Moto Z their phone of choice, especially since they come at a high price. At the moment, they’re more of a novelty than a necessity, which is a barrier competitors like LG and Google will also face as they pursue development of their own modular smartphones. 3.5 out of 5 stars Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4227328/lg-g5-specs-release-2016/", "http://time.com/4346811/google-project-ara-phone-launch/"], "sentiment_score": 0.17266172361917045, "subjectivity_score": 0.50263850806404},

Here’s What It’s Like to Use", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "July 14, 2017 4:04 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4859000/essential-phone-android-google-andy-rubin/", "text": "Samsung and Apple ship more smartphones worldwide than any other company. But Android creator Andy Rubin is betting he can solve a few problems with their phones, which is why the first product to come from his new company Essential will be an Android phone. Rubin unveiled the device in May, and I had the chance to briefly use it during an event in New York. The phone, which starts at $699 and will be available later this summer exclusively on Sprint, shares some physical characteristics with the LG G6. Both phones feature super thin bezels and angular edges, but there are several aspects about Essential’s device I prefer over LG’s device. For one, the corners are a bit sharper, which I think gives the phone a classier look. It reminds me of a more modern version of Apple’s iPhone 4 and 4S, perhaps among the most beautiful smartphones ever made, mostly because of its boxy shape and elegant glass-coated back. But more importantly, the Essential phone is void of any branding. There’s no logo representing the carrier or Rubin’s company anywhere on the phone. This may sound like a worthless omission, but it does a lot to make the device feel slick and attractive. Since there’s no branding on the front, it also gives Essential more room to slim down the bezels and extend the phone’s screen even further (the G6 includes an LG logo below the screen). The bezels are so thin, in fact, that it made my iPhone 7 Plus feel gargantuan in comparison, even though Apple’s smartphone actually has a smaller screen. The Essential phone is slightly wider than the Galaxy S8, which features a softer, more rounded shape, but it’s just as easy to operate with one hand. Flip over the phone and you’ll notice something strange: two identical dots situated near the camera. These pins form the port for connecting accessories such as the 360-degree camera that Essential is selling for $199, or $50 if you buy it as a bundle with the phone. The concept is similar to Motorola’s Moto Mods, which make it possible to add contraptions such as movie projectors, camera grips, and extra batteries to certain Motorola phones by snapping the accessories onto a magnetic connector. The Essential phone’s connector is much more discrete than Motorola’s; the Moto Z Droid includes an array of dots near the bottom of the phone on its rear, while Essential’s device only has two near the camera. Read more: Everything We Think We Know About Google’s Next Pixel Smartphone That being said, two of Essential’s design choices may seem jarring to some smartphone shoppers. Like Apple and Motorola, Essential has chosen to omit the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack from its smartphone. And since there are barely any borders framing the display, the front-facing camera juts into the screen, which can make the front look a bit awkward. But it didn’t impede usage in any noticeable way; its impact seems to be purely aesthetic. Based on my limited time with the Essential phone, the software felt just as sleek and minimalist as the hardware. The handset appeared to be running a clean version of Android that hasn’t been modified, meaning it’s just the basic experience without any extra features, widgets, or apps. This makes the phone feel fast, polished, and easy-to-use; there’s no need to worry about accidentally triggering a side menu with a rogue swipe. It’s just the core Android gestures here, which include swiping down from the top to access quick settings and swiping from left to right to pull up the Google screen. Even though Rubin has said in the past that the Essential phone will have its own new smart assistant, I’m told it will support the Google Assistant. This isn’t shocking, as Rubin has said Essential is open to bringing other virtual assistants to its devices. The software on the demo unit I tried wasn’t final, so my experience may not reflect the final product. But I hope it does, because the Essential phone is just as smooth as Google’s own Pixel and Nexus phones, perhaps even more so. It’s impossible to judge whether or not Rubin’s Essential phone lives up to its promises until we get a chance to use the final production version. But it’s certainly promising: a future-proof device that’s resistant to drops and cracks could make this the phone you hang on to for more than 12 months. Still, even if it does deliver on those values, making a dent in a market so heavily dominated by Apple and Samsung will be no easy feat.

The company is building a handful of new capabilities into its messaging software that allow iPhone and iPad owners to communicate in different ways. Here’s a look at all the new features coming to iMessage in iOS 10. With iOS 10, Apple is letting third-party developers plug into iMessage. This means you’ll be able to do things like order food, buy movie tickets, or send money to a friend without leaving the Messages app. It’s similar to the way third party apps work in Facebook Messenger. Apple’s update will also bring the ability to hand-write a note in a messaging thread or draw a sketch using the same Digital Touch feature found on the Apple Watch. You’ll also be able to scribble text over images and videos. iOS 10 will eliminate the need to scroll or search through your keyboard’s emoji library. The new iMessage will make it so that you can tap a word to replace it with the corresponding emoji. The keyboard will also suggest emojis as you type, similar to the way Google’s Gboard keyboard for iPhone already does. Emojis will appear three times larger within messaging threads as well. iMessage users will be able to send messages that are scrambled until the recipient touches them through a new feature Apple calls Invisible Ink. The capability works with text or images, and the user can unscramble the content by swiping his or her finger across the message. For those times when you just want to quickly confirm that you’ve seen a message, or give a quick yes or no answer, Apple has added Tapback. This feature lets you tap a message and send an icon like a heart, a thumbs up or thumbs down, or a question mark among other symbols. Apple wants iMessage users to customize more than just the text and emojis they send each day. With the new iMessage, Apple device owners will be able to add effects to individual chat bubbles. You could, for instance, make a bubble appear larger for emphasis, similar to the Whisper Shout feature in Google’s messaging app Allo. If you want to snap a photo and send it via iMessage, you’ll soon be able to do so from within the Messages app. Tapping the camera icon in Messages will launch the camera viewfinder, so you can take a photo and send it quickly. The camera roll in Messages is also getting a redesign that makes it look more like the iPhone’s Photos app. If you’re tired of the plain white backdrop behind your messaging thread, Apple plans to change this in iOS 10. Users will have the option to add special effects to the background when certain messages are sent. A message that says “Happy New Year,” for example, might change the background to exploding fireworks. In the new Messages app, you’ll be able to share a specific song with a friend through iMessage and listen to it without leaving the messaging thread. Apple is changing the way links look when sent via iMessage. The title of the website and artwork from it will now appear in messaging threads, making it easier to see what’s being shared. Video clips will also play automatically when being shared in iMessage.

The update, which the company unveiled at its annual developer’s conference, will bring new functionality to the iPhone’s operating system, called iOS. Here’s a look at some of the headline features. Messages The biggest change to Apple’s messaging app is the ability for third-party developers to tap into it. Through iMessage, users will be able to send stickers, exchange money, and order food, among other things. It comes after companies like Facebook and Google have made similar announcements regarding their own messaging apps. Apple is also making it easier to view multimedia content in messages. When you pull up the camera, for example, you’ll get a cleaner, richer, menu for selecting images that looks more like how they appear in the camera roll. Apple’s keyboard will also make it easier to input emoji: just tap a word to replace it with an emoji. There are some new text effects coming to Messages, which allow users to make text look larger as it appears in a conversation thread for emphasis, similar to a feature Google introduced in its Allo messaging app last month. You can also hand-write messages on your iPhone in iOS 10, as well as add full screen effects. Instead of the standard plain backdrop, for instance, you can set it so that fireworks explode behind your conversation. There’s also a new feature that makes it possible to scramble text and images — swiping a finger over a scrambled message will decode it. Siri Apple is also opening up Siri to developers, which means users will be able to interact with third-party apps using Apple’s automated assistant. One can, for instance, tell Siri to call an Uber or send a WeChat message. Photos Apple is making a significant update to its Photos app that will leverage technologies like computer vision and machine learning. The app will be able to recognize faces, objects, and scenes in images stored on an iPhone, allowing users to perform complex searches for specific subjects. It’s similar to the Google Photos app, but all the work is done on the iPhone itself rather than in the cloud. Apple’s new Photos app will also use artificial intelligence to bundle related images into compilations like “Last Weekend” or “On the Mountain.” Apple Maps Apple Maps is getting a few new features too. Maps will be more proactive, meaning it can make suggestions for places you might want to visit based on the time of day or what’s on your calendar. Apple Maps will also be open to third-party developers as well, meaning users will be able to book a reservation using an app like OpenTable directly through Maps. Apple Music Apple is also redesigning its music streaming app. The new Apple Music app will be easier to navigate, with a more streamlined menu for viewing music stored on your iPhone. The For You tab now has a Discovery mix and daily curated playlists. Overall, the app has a cleaner look with bold heading that make it easier to distinguish between different sections. Apple News Apple News is getting a similar update that makes it easier to view stories based on categories and the reader’s taste. A new subscriptions feature lets users read the publications they subscribe to within the app. Breaking news alerts will also be available in the app when iOS 10 launches. HomeKit Apple is launching a new Home app that’s meant to manage all of the smart devices that run on its HomeKit framework. It allows users to access all of the HomeKit-enabled accessories in their home through one single app, rather than having to jump between separate apps made by developers and device makers. HomeKit will also be built into the Control Center in iOS 10, meaning you can just swipe up and to the right to manage devices. Phone The Phone app in iOS 10 will also transcribe voicemails so that iPhone users can see what the message is about without having to listen to it. Third party communication apps will also be integrated into contact entries so that you can use a different service like WhatsApp to contact people. 3DTouch When iOS 10 launches in the fall, iPhone owners will be able to reply to notifications on the lock screen using 3DTouch. You’ll also get live updates from apps on the lock screen by using 3DTouch on an alert.   Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.12329337329337332, "subjectivity_score": 0.4575174825174825},

He’s a nerd all right, but not the kind who went to a top-ranked university, wrote brilliant code or studied business plans. He’s cheery and talks in normal sentences that are easy to understand. He was homeschooled, and though he did drop out of college, it was California State University, Long Beach, where he was majoring not in computer science but in journalism. He prefers shorts, and his feet are black because he doesn’t like wearing shoes, even outdoors. He doesn’t look like a guy who played Dungeons & Dragons so much as a character in Dungeons & Dragons. He’s a nerd from a different century, working on the problems of a different century. Palmer Luckey is a tinkerer. If he had been one of those kids obsessed with Matchbox cars, we might have a flying car by now. But he was into video games and 1990s-era science fiction, so this year we will have virtual reality. As an 18-year-old who took apart smartphones and fixed them for cash, he figured out that the solutions to the problems virtual-reality engineers weren’t able to solve were right inside his phone. Now 22, Luckey sold his company, Oculus VR, to Facebook last year for $2.3 billion, allowing it to grow to more than 350 employees in offices in Silicon Valley, Seattle, Dallas and Austin as well as in South Korea and Japan. That’s because, as fantastical as Luckey’s dreams were–I want to feel like I’m really running down halls shooting bad guys!–Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of the tech industry had a much bigger hope for the sensory-immersion goggles Luckey used to carry around in a yellow bucket in order to hold loose wires. They had seen the Internet get disrupted by mobile and were wary of being blindsided by the next platform for accessing information–which they thought might be hiding in Luckey’s yellow bucket. “We were thinking about how this will affect our friends who are into gaming,” says Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe, sitting in his company’s building on the Facebook campus in Menlo Park, Calif. “Mark is always thinking about, How does this impact 1 billion people?” Luckey, who loved The Matrix and Neal Stephenson’s virtual-reality thriller Snow Crash, understood Zuckerberg right away. “Could you call a book the final platform? Of course not. It’s limited in the kind of stimulus it supplies,” Luckey says. “Virtual reality is the final platform.” And while the first true virtual-reality machines won’t start coming out until Christmas, a lot of people have already quit their jobs or funded projects in the belief that the final platform is here. Virtual reality has been promised for decades, but in my conversations with the top developers in the field, it quickly became clear that never before have so much money and talent bet on its imminent arrival. Headsets will start going on sale this year, and competition will increase dramatically through 2016. At first they’ll be bought by hardcore gamers and gadget geeks. They’ll be expensive–as much as $1,500 with all the accoutrements. And just as with cell phones, everyone else will mock the early adopters for mindlessly embracing unnecessary technology with no useful purpose. At first. A good place to start that mocking would have been AT&T Park. In April, a group of virtual-reality entrepreneurs are wearing huge bright red plastic sunglasses, walking on the field where the San Francisco Giants play. Venture capitalist Mike Rothenberg, 30, rented the stadium so the 360 guests he’s invited can see the 20 virtual-reality companies that his firm, Rothenberg Ventures, has funded. They can also take batting practice, drink cocktails, pet adoptable dogs and build their own goody bags. For each VR demo, I put on a clunky pair of goggles, most of which have a smartphone slipped into a slot in front of my eyes, which does most of the work. These machines are not as complex as what Luckey developed, but they provide a cheap, effective rendition. The screen, when it’s that close to your face, fills your field of vision–the first frameless visual medium. The sense of depth is far more realistic than 3-D, with everything stretching out to infinity, scaled perfectly. And I can look all around, whipping my head to see above, below and behind me, which gives me brief moments of what virtual-reality pioneers longingly call “presence”–when you really feel like you’re inside a fake environment. It’s an amazing technical achievement. I’m psyched I got to try it, but it’s not something I’m going to choose over watching TV. The graphics are clunky, and I can see individual pixels, so I’m pretty far from fooled into thinking I’m not inside a ballpark. It’s like the coolest version of the 1970s View-Master toy I could imagine. It’s also close enough to The Matrix to excite all these people. Xavier Palomer Ripoll has come from Spain to work for three months at Rothenberg Ventures’ VR accelerator. He’s created a bunch of animated situations that allow therapists to use immersion therapy with clients who have anxiety disorders, letting them virtually sit on a plane or ride in an elevator, for example. “They currently use imagination. They hold a picture of a plane, and they say, ‘Imagine you’re in a plane.’ What the f—, man?” he asks. Everyone here is equally aghast that we’re stuck in a pre-virtual-reality world: Ryan Holmes paid $15,000 to put a camera on the International Space Station so he can one day charge people $10 a month to see space in virtual reality; Ashley Granata is creating Pendnt, which allows people to try on clothing virtually; Howard Rose had me use a joystick to shoot VR balls hanging from VR landscapes to distract me from the pain of having my free hand submerged in ice-cold water. On the deck of the stadium, wearing a Founder Field Day baseball jersey and sunglasses, Rothenberg says his firm has already secured enough money to invest in a second round of virtual-reality companies this fall. “It’s hard for people to write checks for virtual reality until they try it. Then, not that hard,” he says. He likens this opportunity to the Internet in 1995. “No one calls a company an ‘Internet company’ anymore. In 10 years, everyone will have VR as part of their company.” It’s already starting. Lately, I’ve been bombarded by virtual reality. At a party in Los Angeles in May, Patrón launched a virtual tour of the hacienda in Mexico where its agave is distilled. Birchbox announced that this month its men’s subscription box will include a virtual-reality viewer and app allowing its subscribers to surf or fly a helicopter. And at North Face stores, you can see virtual video of dudes climbing a rock face in the company’s gear. James Blaha, a game developer with severe lazy eye–a condition that affects about 2% to 3% of the world’s population–has used virtual reality to basically cure the disease in 30-minute sessions over three to four weeks; he’s sold 1,000 copies of the system to optometrists already. And Hollywood is putting nearly as much money as Silicon Valley into the concept. Nearly every week, there’s a virtual-reality convention. Standing in line with 1,500 other people for the sold-out Virtual Reality Los Angeles spring expo in March to visit the booths of more than 50 companies, I am asked to sign a contract. It is not, like other tech releases, about me not telling anyone about anything I saw or thought I might have seen here. Instead, it says, “I am aware that some people experience nausea, disorientation, motion sickness, general discomfort, headaches or other health issues when experiencing virtual reality.” The final platform is not making a great first impression. Luckily, I don’t barf. The nausea caused by virtual reality is the inverse of car sickness: your eyes see motion but your middle ear feels nothing. This challenge has largely been solved by faster screen-refresh rates–the final version of Oculus will allow only 20 milliseconds between a head turn and visual change; an eyeblink takes about 300 milliseconds. VR companies are also shying away from putting viewers on virtual roller coasters and Formula One tracks. But they are creating everything else. In a speech in a packed auditorium, Jens Christensen, CEO of Jaunt, which makes high-end VR cameras, says building actual flying cars and jet packs is now irrelevant. The only question, he says, is how soon we can “simulate our own personal Tomorrowlands.” Two months after Facebook paid $2 billion for Oculus, Google responded at its annual I/O conference in San Francisco’s Moscone Center by handing each of the audience members a piece of flat cardboard as they left the keynote presentation. This, they were told, when folded up and paired with a smartphone, was Google’s new virtual-reality player. Most people thought it was a joke. But with two cheap plastic magnifying lenses placed in a box that cradles your phone, it can create a 3-D effect not unlike that of much more expensive equipment. At the Googleplex, Clay Bavor, vice president of product management, shows me the second generation of Google Cardboard. “The delta between expectation and delivery is so high,” says Bavor. “It’s cardboard–how good can it be? And then it’s like, ‘Whoa! I’m sitting somewhere else!'” In 1994, when Bavor was 12, he used the HyperCard program on his Apple computer to stitch together hundreds of photos of his house in his first attempt at VR. Google’s version of virtual reality isn’t that much more cutting edge. “It’s going to be a long, long time before anywhere near that many people have these high-end devices,” says Bavor. So for now, you can do a lot of low-tech virtual-reality stuff with Google Cardboard. Google doesn’t bother making money off Cardboard–the specs are free online, and many companies sell them for $6 and up–but the company is making software for it. You can download an app made by Jaunt and get a good sense of what it’s like to be backstage at a Paul McCartney concert. Google teamed up with GoPro to make a wheel of 16 cameras that shoots 360-degree video and created software that allows you to stitch the shots together into a video you can then upload to the new virtual-reality section of YouTube. Through a program called Expeditions, Google has already sent 100 classrooms a field trip in a box; teachers use Cardboards to lead kids through natural, architectural and Martian wonders. The company worked with partners like the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural History to create 3-D images not unlike those in the plastic viewfinders that were popular in the 1970s. This comparison isn’t lost on Google, which has a deal with Mattel to put out a version of Google Cardboard in a View-Master. Oculus has also entered the mobile space, since it isn’t planning to release its main product, the Rift, until 2016. (“If the iPhone were introduced in any quarter, it would have been a hit. I doubt they were saying, ‘What’s important for the iPhone? We have to hit Christmas,'” says Luckey about letting his competition beat him to market.) Oculus partnered with Samsung to build Gear VR, a pair of goggles with motion detectors that you can slip a Galaxy Note 4 phone into. The device is available at Best Buy for $200 and is lent to first-class passengers on Qantas. Three high-end virtual-reality products not made of cardboard are being put out by Oculus, Sony and Valve. The latter two companies have an advantage in that their gamer customers already own machines with powerful graphics capabilities. Founded by former Microsoft developers, Valve makes popular games and runs the Steam download store, which sells about three-quarters of all PC games. As I walk into one of the rooms used for demonstrating the company’s Vive headset, scheduled to be released this Christmas, I see Steve Jurvetson, one of the most powerful Silicon Valley venture capitalists, walking out of the other one. Valve gives several demonstrations a day. “We won’t talk to people until they have a demo,” says Ken Birdwell, a longtime employee. “If we talked to them before, it would just be arguments about why these things wouldn’t work. After, they say, ‘We have to hurry. We have six months until this hits the consumer space.'” When they agreed to show their technology to an employee of Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer HTC, they were surprised when she turned out to be Cher Wang, who runs the company. After seeing it, Wang asked if HTC could manufacture the product for Valve, which it is now doing. Unlike Google Cardboard or anything else you can buy right now, the Vive requires you to hook it up to a computer fast enough for gaming. And for you to be physically attached to that computer with a wire. And to strap on a pouch. And to put little laser sensors in the corners of the room. In return, you can get out of your chair and unvirtually walk around the virtual world you see through the Vive goggles. This would seem dangerous. But the headset alerts you when you’re near a wall. It would also seem to require you to have a 16-by-12-ft. (5 by 4 m) empty room in your house. Jeep Barnett, who has worked on the project from the beginning, isn’t worried. “Sell your dining-room table and eat over your sink,” he says. “If you have a pool table, get rid of that. Get a Murphy bed. People are going to find a space. You have a space for your car because you have to have the superpower of getting downtown in 20 minutes.” They strap the Vive goggles and pack on me, put a controller in each of my hands and bring up the menu. I instantly understand virtual reality. At the press of a button, I inflate and release a cartoon balloon in the air, and it floats into the infinite black sky. This is just to make sure the controllers work, so they want me to move on, but I keep doing it. The sense of scale is like seeing the night sky for the first time in a national park: peaceful, awesome, meditative. I feel like I have disappeared. Eventually, I try their games, pulling an arrow from a quiver and shooting it, feeling the tension of the bow thanks to the specifically designed VR controllers’ haptic feedback, which is much more subtle than the vibrations of a typical game controller. I crawl underneath game pieces in a live board game where tiny fighters shoot each other. And in the most impressive virtual-reality experience I have, I use a program called Tilt Brush (since purchased by Google, which has a bunch of high-end virtual-reality projects it’s keeping quiet) to paint in three dimensions. Walking around dripping neon, I paint in the sky in a way that makes me never need to try LSD. I take the goggles off, making what people call “VR face,” the geek version of “O face.” Birdwell says, “You’re seeing the Pong version. These are early, early days.” Every program I saw used graphics instead of real video, which still looks like crap; this is why virtual reality might be the first technology not successfully pioneered by the porn industry. (Though a lot of companies are trying VR erotica.) Sony’s Project Morpheus, which will be available next year, is similar. Because 20 million people own the Sony PlayStation 4–which has the controller, tracking camera and powerful gaming chips that Oculus and Valve users will need–it’s got a huge advantage. As with the Oculus, Sony doesn’t expect you to walk around like you do with the Vive but just to move around on your couch. In a room at E3, the video-game industry’s giant annual convention in Los Angeles (the Oculus offices have a clock that counts down to it), I slip on a light, sleek, ready-to-ship Morpheus headset that plugs into the PlayStation 4 and has a button that lets you extend the glasses out so you can check your phone or sip a drink. In one demo, from a company called VirZOOM, I sit on a stationary bike to feel like I’m riding a horse (and later a Pegasus) while I work out. The company was co-founded by Eric Malafeew, who quit a developer job at Harmonix, where he made Guitar Hero and Rock Band. Large game companies are now losing engineers who are eager to play with virtual reality while they wait until enough people own headsets to make it a decent business proposition. Richard Marks, a senior researcher at Sony, says that in the past few months it has gotten the hardware far enough along that the software will now matter more. Already, he says, what game designers call “talent amplification” is more impressive than he imagined. “I can point at something and have the force and levitate it, and it really feels like I’m doing it. When you play a game, you say, ‘I died.’ But in virtual reality, man, it’s even more powerful.” I try a few more games before I’m ushered out so they can clear the room for a VIP. As I walk out, Steven Spielberg walks in. At the Oculus building on the Facebook campus, I have a transcendent virtual-reality experience while using the latest version of the Rift. Palmer Luckey, whose real name is Palmer Luckey, wears flip-flops today instead of going barefoot, out of respect for our meeting. People here are so comfortable with VR that they refer to things outside of virtual reality–what most people call “life”–as RR, or real reality. A team of directors and writers led by Saschka Unseld left Pixar and DreamWorks to work at Oculus Story Studio, a 10-person team making short movies like Henry, the story of an adorable hedgehog with a hugging addiction. Oculus can’t spend the money in-house fast enough: it offered a total of $1 million for the winners of its gaming competition, the Mobile VR Jam. Just four years ago, an 18-year-old Luckey had amassed a personal museum of old VR gear. “I had one system that was originally $97,000. I bought it [used] for $80,” he says. So he got two eyeglass lenses, duct-taped them over a phone, shoved the equipment that was too heavy to fit on someone’s head into a bucket and drove from his parents’ house to tech shows, draping a black T-shirt over users’ heads to block their peripheral vision. Soon John Carmack–the gaming legend who popularized the first-person perspective–asked to buy one. Luckey, out of respect, refused to charge him. Carmack was so impressed, he quit the multimillion-dollar company he’d founded–aware it would sue him for leaving–to work for a homeschooled teen. In 2012, Luckey tried to raise $250,000 on Kickstarter and got $2.4 million. “It was nice to find out I wasn’t the only nutter,” he says. The version Oculus plans to sell next year will be a niche product for gamers, not a mass-market device. To get to that level there are still kinks to work out, including a screen that is 32,000 pixels by 32,000 pixels, instead of the current 1,000 by 1,000; a way to power that screen, preferably with smaller batteries that don’t get so hot they’ll burn your face; a way to make the parts directly in front of your eye super-clear, as in real reality; scent and touch; a camera that shoots virtual video. That last one, Palmer says, will be huge–the way that photographs and then video changed the way we record history. Already, at E3, Oculus showed some impressive demos. Sure, it had a game where I was an NHL goalie that was fun and another wonderfully vertigo-inducing flight simulator where I flew a spaceship fighting some vaguely Death Star–like enemy, but the coolest thing by far was something it’s not even planning on selling: Toy Box. I held thin black plastic circle-shaped controllers called Oculus Touch, put on the goggles and saw the vague figure of a guy who was really in a room next door. While we spoke, I used my fist to play tetherball with him and flicked foam blocks at him with my finger. He shot me with a laser to make me tiny. We even hugged, and my personal space felt virtually invaded. He had my attention in a way that no one on a phone or Skype call ever has. And not just because he had a gun that could reduce me to Ant-Man. Everyone working on virtual reality knows that even after they manage to make goggles the size of sunglasses, as Zuckerberg keeps promising, the technology will merge with augmented reality, which is the new term for holograms. Seeing fake things overlaid on the real world makes a lot more sense, since you’d get to see all the real world’s inconvenient walls. But holograms are an amazingly hard thing to do. Nobody at any of the VR expos even bothers to give speeches about it. The Oculus guys figure that maybe their kids will work it out. “We started on augmented reality,” says Valve’s Birdman. “There are hard physics problems. You can’t get a wide field of view. You can’t draw a shadow. There are power and battery problems. When it happens, I’ll buy it.” Underneath the most well-trodden spot on Microsoft’s Redmond, Wash., campus is the secret bunker where it makes holograms. The company is trying to jump from behind Silicon Valley to get in front of it. So it’s skipping virtual reality before it even comes out and selling augmented reality. The lab looks like the place a James Bond villain would work in if he hired interior designers from the W Hotel and lighting experts from Virgin America. Everyone here is futuristically calm. A huge man who is not a bouncer but an engineer silently lets me in and points me to a bench where a woman named N stands in front of me, demoing how to wear Microsoft’s HoloLens goggles. They are beautiful and comfortable and weigh about a pound. No wires tether me to a computer, thanks to a Holographic Processor Unit built into the gadget next to the central processing unit and graphics processor. I don’t need to carry a smartphone, strap a pack around my waist or hook laser sensors to a wall. And I can see out the clear visor perfectly. Alex Kipman is in charge of the bunker, having overseen Microsoft Kinect, the Xbox add-on that allowed people to control what happens onscreen by waving their hands and using their voices, like in Minority Report. When the first version of Kinect was released five years ago, it was the coolest thing Microsoft had ever made. Kipman is also cool. He’s got a Brazilian accent and dresses like a man who takes Burning Man seriously: shiny gray pants; a long jacket with embroidery; blunt, shoulder-length hair. “If I told people at Microsoft I wanted to make virtual reality, they would have nodded their head yes,” he says. But Kipman wants to save us from spending yet more time on our computers instead of with one another. “Virtual reality is not embracing that which makes us human. Kinect was about embracing what’s in all of us. Humans exist in the real world. Holograms say, ‘Hey, technology has become sophisticated enough today that we’re ready to go beyond being stuck behind pixels all day long.'” Holograms, he believes, will reverse our isolation and inactivity. HoloLens is not a pet project for Microsoft. It’s an integral part of Windows 10, its major new operating system released in July. To see it, I am led to well-lit rooms where I get to do amazing, sci-fi-level things. I look at a real table holding a holographic architectural model of an office complex; I move my hand to raise and lower parts of the building, or zoom in on a wall and look at the pipes behind it. At E3, I get to project Minecraft on a real table, zooming in on another player running up a tower faster than he ever could with a keyboard; I torment him by flicking my finger and verbally calling in lightning strikes. As amazing as this is–I am moving around holograms with my hand and voice–it still looks fuzzy, like something went wrong with R2-D2’s message from Princess Leia. It all has to fit on this rectangle in front of my eyes, and the small field of vision makes it seem like it’s on a screen instead of being real. It’s impressive–and the hardware and packaging are way ahead of those of Oculus and Valve–but holograms just don’t seem real yet. As I leave, Kipman asks me how much I think the HoloLens will cost. “Assuming there are apps I want, $250,” I say. Kipman looks at me. “You know there’s a computer in there?” “$350?” I suggest. “Thank you for your honesty,” he says. Still, HoloLens is a convincing proof of concept. And Kipman’s pro-hologram, anti-virtual-reality logic seems incontrovertible. “The amount of data and signal you get for free from the real world is massive,” he says. “You already know how to walk around and communicate.” But Palmer Luckey thinks holograms will never be a platform. “Augmented reality is well suited for utility purposes,” he says. “Look at science fiction. Most uses of AR are how to repair things, navigation aids, more information about the environment. But there’s no proof it can be a canvas for compelling storytelling.” The guys working on virtual reality since the 1980s hadn’t all stopped by the time Luckey began buying their old models for his collection. Mark Bolas, a professor at the University of Southern California both in the film school and at his Institute of Creative Technologies, open-sourced his design for the very Cardboard-like FOV2GO in 2012, which thousands of people downloaded so they could have a $5 homemade virtual-reality headset. And Luckey worked in Bolas’ lab for a year before Bolas suggested he start Oculus, in which Bolas was an early investor. “He was the right guy to bring it out,” says Bolas. “He had the charisma.” Bolas, who has puffy white hair and types on a computer keyboard raised by six unwrapped blank VHS tapes, works out of a huge Los Angeles warehouse that has an enormous room with tiny tracking cameras hanging along the periphery. He cannot wait to start making virtual-reality worlds, which he thinks will save us. He has no fears about humanity being sucked into the Matrix. “I believe we’re in the virtual world now more than the real world already. It’s just that our interface sucks,” he says, pointing to his phone. Just as early Industrial Revolution machines killed people, he thinks, our computers are killing a part of us. “We’re in that barbaric place where the interfaces to the machines don’t consider the human side,” he says. He’s been building virtual-reality worlds with stop-motion Claymation, trying to get at the interactive, world-bending experiences VR can offer. Because, unlike movies, virtual reality can make you feel dumb or successful by reacting to you. “Presence has to go both ways. The world has to acknowledge that you’re in it,” he says. “This is what I have film students for. To figure out what I do with this.” Now that the hardware can be made at a price for the consumer market, a lot of people are trying to figure that out. Both Oculus and Valve pretty quickly got that the storytelling rules of video games don’t work. Like Luckey, Valve employees also initially thought, I want to feel like I’m really running down halls shooting bad guys! But they quickly discovered they did not want that at all. One of the first things they created was a zombie game where you mow down bad guys. “We noticed that everyone would move as far away from a zombie as they could. One zombie! And it was barely moving. It was like a statue of a zombie. The terror level of a single zombie was ridiculous,” Birdman says. “But now I have all these emotional cues I’ve never been able to use before. It’s what makes this terrifying and exciting at the same time.” Jeremy Bailenson has been thinking about these problems since he founded Stanford’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab in 2003. He has a suite of offices in the communications department, which, until recently, was one of the few places in the world to try real virtual reality, because a system used to cost $100,000. He runs psychological experiments where people become aged versions of themselves to help them save for retirement; in a video on how to deal with harassment, the user can become a young black woman being interviewed by an old white guy. After people fly like a superhero and deliver medicine to a sick child, they are more helpful when an assistant pretends to accidentally drop her stuff in the hallway. Bailenson doesn’t think that his life’s work is the final platform. He thinks people will get hurt walking into walls or when a dog darts across the room. He thinks the glasses will never be comfortable to wear for long periods. And that an all-virtual world is creepy. “I’m actually a Luddite. I don’t play video games. I don’t have a Facebook account,” he says. At the Tribeca Film Festival’s symposium on virtual reality this year, he warned the audience against making entertainment for virtual reality. “Do you want to be in the trash compactor in Star Wars? No, you don’t. If Jaws felt like what you just did in my lab, no one would ever go in the ocean again.” VR, he believes, is an empathy machine and should be saved for that purpose. Felix Lajeunesse and Paul Raphael totally agree with everything Bailenson says and are making virtual-reality entertainment anyway. In their 20-person ministudio in Montreal, they’ve built their own camera to capture video: it’s the size of a seated person, with a battery for a body, two cameras for eyes and four sets of molded ears for microphones. They use the camera to allow viewers to slowly explore a place. They’re documenting nomadic tribes around the world so you can sit in a Mongolian yurt while a family cooks. When they showed Oculus what they were working on, they feared the company would think it was dumb. Instead, Oculus gave them money to make films for its own studio. “You can be slow in virtual reality and lose fewer people. In fact, they prefer it,” says Raphael. Universal Pictures hired them to make an experience tied to Jurassic World to show at festivals, and they made the single longest dinosaur shot in history. Because, they knew, it’s plenty interesting to look at a dinosaur. But when Raphael showed virtual reality to director James Cameron–the technology-pushing creator of Avatar, Titanic and Terminator–in May 2013, Cameron stated that he had no use for it. “This has very little to do with controlling the viewers’ attention,” says Lajeunesse. “It’s not necessarily a medium for filmmakers.” He and Raphael have mostly been hiring painters, photographers and stage directors. Chris Milk, a music-video director whose interactive installations have been shown at MOMA and the Tate galleries, believes VR, like all media before it, is for storytelling. He’s built his own VR camera to let him get closer to his subjects, who include a 12-year-old Syrian refugee and a Liberian Ebola survivor. “There’s something about sitting on the same ground someone else is sitting on that changes the way your brain registers their humanity,” he says. Commercial director Jonnie Ross met Palmer Luckey at a convention. After using the Oculus Rift that day, Ross quit his job and called his friend Gil Baron, a visual-effects supervisor. “He was talking fast,” says Baron. “Like that moment in Back to the Future where Marvin Berry calls Chuck Berry to tell him what he just heard.” Baron quit too, and they now work at Visionary VR in downtown Los Angeles. They’re trying to figure out how to tell a story in virtual reality. “It’s like you went back in time and gave a caveman a video camera,” Baron says. To make their animated short, they developed editing software that involves holding two controllers and seeing those controllers in virtual reality as you move elements on the screen. It’s incredibly intuitive. But, they both say, figuring out how to tell a story in virtual reality–first person? choose your own adventure? scene cuts?–is not. Jaron Lanier, who in 1984 founded VPL Research, the first company to widely sell VR products, and is credited with, depending on whom you ask, either creating or popularizing the term virtual reality, is pretty sure they’re all as wrong as the directors of the first movies, who just filmed stage performances. Virtual reality, he says, is a means of spontaneous, improvisational visual expression, the same way that talking is a means of aural communication; it’s the next logical step from written language to printing press to photograph to audio recording to film. “It can blur the distinction between you and the rest of the world. You have the option to map yourself to the clouds or the grass. When you move your body, all the clouds and animals can move in sync with you,” he says. “In about a year or two, nobody will find this hard to understand. This will become totally ordinary.” And Lanier, author of the 2011 critique of digital culture You Are Not a Gadget, can’t wait. “In the 1980s, this was a really big deal. I was in my 20s. It wasn’t at all clear I’d live long enough to see it cycled back again.” Maybe virtual reality will be a radical new form of expression. Maybe it will just be for short, immersive, therapeutic experiences. Or maybe it’s just another entertainment medium to accompany theater, painting, print, music and film. In the Oculus office, an executive showed me a game called Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. It’s a three-player game, and before we opened the office door to look for someone to join us, Palmer Luckey noticed what we were doing and sat down. I put on the goggles and described the bomb I saw. Luckey sat in the physical world next to me, excitedly flipping through an instruction book, telling me which wires to snip. I had no idea what virtual reality added to this game. But Luckey couldn’t have been more into it, instinctively racing against the clock. He was determined to figure it out.

Pulling back with my right arm, I launched an arrow that ever so narrowly missed my target, barely grazing his helmet. This was possible because the two video game controllers I was holding in my hands can transform into nearly any tool depending on the situation: a bow-and-arrow in this case, in others an enchanted staff that can cast fire or a magic paintbrush capable of conceiving anything from animated snowflakes to glowing rainbows. Watch This Super-Talented Eighth Grader Paint Using the HTC Vive: These are a few of the experiences I had using the $799 HTC Vive virtual reality headset, which began shipping to customers on April 5. The gadget runs on Steam created by Valve, meaning it will look familiar to gamers who typically use the gaming storefront on a PC or Steam Machine. Like the Oculus Rift, the Vive is meant to bring powerful, immersive, high-end virtual reality experiences to the home. But it differs from the Rift and other competing products in important ways. While many of the Rift’s games and experiences require you to move your character with a video game controller (Oculus’ motion controllers are coming later this year), the Vive allows you to physically interact with the virtual environment you’re seeing through the headset. This means you can lift a virtual bow-and-arrow and position your arms as if you were actually holding the real weapon to fire it. You can pick up and examine objects as if you were holding them in your hand—a charming characteristic that’s sure to work its way into mystery and puzzle games. These elements add a new dimension to virtual reality that makes it feel all the more authentic. The Vive provides the most wowing experience of VR so far. MORE: These Are the 5 Best HTC Vive Launch Games But an experience like this also means there’s a bit more work to be done when it comes to the setup process compared to the Rift. Two base stations are included in the Vive kit, which work best when mounted in a high area at opposing ends of your room. These black boxes emit lasers that scan the room, which are detected by the Vive headset and its controllers. This system helps the PC keep track of where the Vive and motion controllers are located in the virtual environment. The Vive then scales apps and games to fit in a real-world space of up to 15 x 15-feet, which makes objects and environments appear at a size that makes sense for the room you’re currently playing in. To get the best results out of the Vive, though, you’ll have to clear a decent amount of empty space, which can be a challenge for those living in tighter quarters. If you’re worried about walking into walls, there’s a safety measure in place to ensure you don’t venture beyond the Vive’s designated area to prevent such accidents. When setting up the Vive, the machine will ask you to map out the space in which you plan to use the headset by physically tracing a border around the room with a controller. This is what the Vive calls the “play area,” and if you come close to its border during gameplay, a glowing, Matrix-esque grid will appear to warn you to stop. This is subtle but effective—the grid appears prominently enough to alert you, but not so much that it interferes with gameplay. The setup process takes roughly 20 to 30 minutes and is relatively simple thanks to the Vive’s tutorial. Launching the Vive app on your desktop will walk you through all of the steps, which generally include logging in with your Steam account, mounting the sensors, plugging the headset into your computer, turning on the controllers, and calibrating the room. You can also access the room calibration tool any time within the Steam interface if something doesn’t feel right. The first time we set up the Vive, for example, we calibrated the floor incorrectly, so the game’s virtual ground sat at my waist instead of near my feet. Fixing the issue only took a few minutes. The Vive is just as conspicuous as it is mesmerizing. Because it generates a digital environment that feels ultra realistic, it needs to remain tethered to a powerful PC to prevent any latency—just like the Rift. The downside is that a trail of dangling wires follows as you move around in virtual reality, which you’ll need to be aware of during gameplay to avoid tripping. It can sometimes take you out of the experience, but it’s worth the trade off to avoid lag and stutter. Although the Vive headset looks and feels slightly bulkier than the Rift, it fits snugly and was comfortable to wear. I didn’t find myself toggling the focus or adjusting the straps very often, which is helpful for maintaining a seamless experience. With Oculus’ Rift, you’re restricted mostly to sitting experiences, waggling thumbsticks or tapping buttons on a gamepad—the novelty’s all in what you can do with your head. The Vive adds both of your hands by way of large dual wands that look a bit like Boba Fett’s Slave One. The difference these make in virtual space is staggering. MORE: Which Virtual Reality Headset Should I Buy? Instead of indirect controls, your hands become whatever an experience warrants: a pair of grasping gloves or laser-spitting guns, or a single, swooshing paintbrush. It’s partly next-gen Wii, sure, but with far more precise motion tracking, the crucial distinction being that all the input-output’s transpiring around you instead of on a flat two-dimensional screen half a dozen feet away. It’s a difference you can measure in astonished expletives whenever you slip the headset onto curious passerby. In Google’s bundled Tilt Brush, for instance, players transform empty space into a montage of stirring chromatic light by swinging a virtual brush around. Rifle through a simple selection tool and you can add twinkling stars, smoke, swirls of blinking neon or frame your creation against a cosmic backdrop. Freebie download The Lab allows you to visit the top of a mountain by way of vertiginous vantage points in what amounts to a VR-movement tutorial, teleporting around (including over to a stomach-dropping precipice) by simply pointing a wand and clicking. In another, you can slingshot spheroid robots (styled after Wheatley from Portal 2) at piles of boxes in a warehouse (an obvious nod to Angry Birds). It’s breezy proof-of-concept stuff, but an obvious go-to showcase, say a friend drops by and you want to show them what the whole VR thing’s about. The other bundled Vive must-try, Job Simulator, lets you wing donuts at a frowny floating computer or joggle 2-liter bottles of soda until they detonate. The year is 2050, robots have supplanted human labor, and so it’s left to virtual reality to remind us what line-cooking, office-cubing and store-clerking was like—or would have been through a lens anarchically. Owlchemy Labs’ turns busywork into a carnival of irreverent gestures, laying playgrounds of objects before your Mickey Mouse-gloved hands and letting your imagination do the rest. And if you’d rather try a straightforward adventure, Cloudhead Games’ $29.99 The Gallery: Call of the Starseed exemplifies why virtual reality’s breaking wave of whatchamacallit experiences work best when moving you gradually through otherworldly venues in lieu of barf-o-rama spectacle. Call of the Starseed kicks off an episodic story inspired by 1980s dark fantasy films and old-school graphical adventure games, sending you after a missing sibling and through a gauntlet of environmental puzzles. But it’s just as much about the thrill of using two hands to perform intuitive actions, like holding a flickering candle up in near darkness to tease the mysteries from a hand-scrawled note. Should you buy one? The Vive is expensive, not particularly lacking in commitments (it requires a significant amount of space and wiring), and requires a beefy PC. But it’s the most immersive and complete VR experience out there right now. The additional $200 over the Oculus, for example, seems to be made up for by the advanced touch controllers which come with the Vive. If you have money to burn and an interest in virtual reality, for now, HTC’s Vive is the device to beat.

On some level or another, virtual reality technology has been around for decades. But this year is the first time you can go out and buy a headset that brings VR into your home. There’s a wide range of virtual reality headsets on the market, from the high-end Oculus Rift to the entry-level Samsung Gear VR (not to mention the DIY cardboard variety). All of them offer a wide variety of experiences, ranging from games to interactive stories to 360-degree video. So which VR headset is right for you? That decision will likely come down to how much you’re willing to spend, and what kind of hardware you already own. Most of these headsets cost hundreds of dollars, while some require expensive, high-end computers to help power them. Here’s a closer look at how today’s VR offerings compare — and which headsets we recommend. BEST PICK: Samsung Gear VR Price: $99.99 System Requirements: Compatible with the following Samsung phones: Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge Estimated cost of system requirements: Between approx. $629 and $800, depending on which Samsung phone you choose (without carrier subsidy) Number of available apps and games: 400 apps through the Oculus Store, 1,000-plus videos through Samsung’s VR content service Sensors: Gyroscope, accelerometer, proximity sensor, touchpad for navigation Field of view: 101 degrees Resolution: Based on Samsung phones with 2,560×1,440 resolution display (Note: Resolution when looking through the Gear VR will be lower since it provides a windowed view of the phone’s screen) Refresh Rate: 60Hz What’s in the box: Samsung Gear VR headset The Samsung Gear VR‘s $99.99 price, the fact that it’s cordless, and its overall effortless setup make it a more practical, albeit more limited, option than premium virtual reality headsets like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Unless you’re an early adopter, the Gear VR is probably the best option for you, especially if you already own a Samsung phone. Why is the Gear VR so inexpensive? It has several limitations: It doesn’t track your body’s movement in the digital space the way the Vive, Rift, and PlayStation VR do, vastly restricting how you can interact with virtual objects. This means you can’t wave, duck, or aim at characters using the Gear VR the same way you can with these other headsets. Instead, you’ll need to use the touchpad mounted on the side of the headset or a controller accessory to navigate virtual worlds. That said, the Gear VR offers a convincing enough experience to trick your brain into thinking your body is moving, a sensation that makes virtual reality unlike anything else you’ve tried before. The experience is vivid enough to give you a taste of virtual reality, but at a much more accessible price point than the other headsets listed here. Samsung’s Gear VR has plenty of room for improvement. Its biggest drawback is that it lacks a controller specifically designed for virtual reality. Google’s upcoming Daydream View headset, which costs only $79 and could eventually be compatible with a wider range of smartphones, launches in November — with a remote that enables gesture controls. If it works well, Google’s headset could replace the Gear VR as our top pick in this list. But it’s worth mentioning that Gear VR is powered by the Oculus platform, meaning it already has lots of great content and is likely to get more features down the road. Buy here RUNNER UP: PlayStation VR Price: $399.99 System Requirements: PlayStation 4 (standard, Pro, or Slim), PlayStation Camera, PlayStation Move controllers (optional but recommended) Estimated cost of system requirements: Around $300-$400 depending on the console model, about $59.99 for PlayStation Camera, $49.99 per PlayStation Move controller Number of available apps and games: 30 at launch, 50 before the end of the year Sensors: Six-axis motion sensing system (three-axis gyroscope, three-axis accelerometer) Field of view: About 100 degrees Resolution: 1920×1080 with full color RGB Refresh Rate: 120Hz, 90Hz What’s in the box: VR headset, processor unit, VR headset connection cable, HDMI cable, USB cable, stereo headphones, AC power cord, AC adaptor, demo disc with 15 games At about $400, the PlayStation VR is significantly cheaper than other premium VR offerings, like the $600 Oculus Rift and $800 HTC Vive. It’s an especially sensible option for VR-curious gamers who already own a PlayStation 4, since Sony’s current console and a $59.99 camera are all you need to power the device (Sony’s roughly $25 Move controllers are optional). Regardless, those who don’t own a PlayStation 4 can buy one for hundreds of dollars cheaper than the near-$1,000 PC currently needed to power the Vive and the Rift. Hardcore gamers that own both a PlayStation 4 and a beastly PC may be wondering how the PlayStation VR compares to its more expensive rivals. While the PlayStation VR’s resolution may not be as sharp as that of the Vive and Rift, Sony’s headset is more comfortable to wear, easier to set up than HTC’s, and offers motion control support at launch. (Rift owners won’t be able to play games using gestures until the company ships its $199 Touch controllers on Dec. 6.) Although the Rift’s resolution is technically higher, the PlayStation VR‘s display has been specifically designed to show red, green, and blue colors at a higher quality than black. This makes graphics appear vivid and clear, since it’s more difficult to see the black spaces between the pixels on the PlayStation VR‘s screen. The mechanism Sony put in place for adjusting the headset’s fit and focus is also much simpler than that of most VR headsets, and is especially friendly to glasses-wearers. The PlayStation VR‘s major drawback is that users are bound by unwieldy cables, which sometimes hinder the experience. That’s also an issue with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, both of which need to be tethered to a computer to work. This is in part why smartphone-powered, and therefore cordless, headsets like the Samsung Gear VR are so attractive. The downside of those headsets, however, is that they don’t provide as high-end an experience. My other gripe with the PlayStation VR is that it doesn’t do a great job at making it easy to see the Move controllers when you’re not playing a specific game. The Vive, by contrast, displays your controllers in the digital space, making it easier to navigate menus and change settings. The PlayStation VR doesn’t do this, meaning it’s tough to switch between the standard DualShock controller and the Move sticks while wearing the headset. Buy here Oculus Rift  Price: $599 System Requirements: Computer with the following specifications: NVIDIA GTX 970/AMD R9 290 equivalent or greater, Intel i5-4590 or greater, 8GB or more of RAM, Compatible HDMI 1.3 video output, 3 USB 3.0 ports and 1 USB 2.0 port, Windows 7 Sp1 64 bit or newer Estimated cost of system requirements: Around $1,000 (Microsoft and Best Buy offer bundles that include both the headset and a compatible computer) Number of available apps and games: More than 100 games Sensors: Gyroscope, accelerometer, optical sensor for peripheral space tracking Field of view: 110 degrees Resolution: 1,200×1,080 pixels per eye Refresh Rate: 90Hz What’s in the box: Oculus Rift headset with quick start guide, camera sensor with built-in stand, small plastic tool for integrated headphone removal, Oculus Remote with integrated battery, Xbox One wireless gamepad, Xbox One USB wireless receiver for gamepad and instructions, two AA batteries for gamepad, two Oculus logo stickers, Oculus lens wipe cloth The Oculus Rift’s high resolution display and beefy system requirements means it offers smooth and realistic virtual reality gameplay. In my experience, using the Rift felt very similar to playing games on the PlayStation VR, although the Rift’s display resolution is a bit crisper. When the Facebook-owned Oculus starts selling its motion remotes in December, I presume this too will feel more or less the same as using the PlayStation VR’s Move wands. Like the PlayStation VR, the Rift requires a single camera which tracks the wearer’s motion. That enables players to wave and point these motion-sensitive remotes within the camera’s range to interact with games and apps. Such functionality is crucial for making VR feel more real than it does when using a regular game controller. Rift owners who wish to upgrade the experience can opt to purchase additional sensors for $79 each, which can enable a room-scale virtual reality experience similar to that of the HTC Vive. The Rift, while it suffers from the same annoying dangling wire issue as its rivals, certainly won’t disappoint. But for gamers seeking a premium VR experience, we recommend the PlayStation VR instead, simply because it’s cheaper. The differences between the two headsets in terms of performance and game selection isn’t different enough to justify an extra $200, not to mention the expensive PC you’ll need to run the Rift. Still, this could very well change in the future. Facebook wants to make VR the next great social platform, so the Oculus is likely to see new features that will make it useful for more than just gaming and watching movies. (These features could also come to cheaper headsets on the Oculus platform, like the aforementioned Samsung Gear VR.) There is one reason to pick the Rift over the PlayStation VR: If you’ve already got a high-end gaming computer, and you don’t have a PlayStation 4, it makes more financial sense for you to pick up the Rift. Buy here HTC Vive Price: $799 System Requirements: Computer with the following specifications: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or Radeon RX 480 equivalent or better, Intel Core i5-4590 or AMD FX 8350 equivalent or better, 4 GB RAM or more, HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2 or newer, 1 USB 2.0 or better, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1 or later Estimated cost of system requirements: Around $1,000 Number of available apps and games: 717 games and experiences between Steam and HTC’s Viveport store Sensors: Inertial measurement units (IMU), positional tracking, G-sensor (accelerometer), gyroscope, proximity Field of view: 110 degrees Resolution: 1080×1200 pixels per eye Refresh Rate: 90Hz What’s in the box: 2 base stations, 2 controllers with lanyards, headset (with 3 in 1 cable and audio cable), sync cable, base station power adaptor, mounting kit, link box, link box mounting pad, link box power adaptor, HDMI cable, USB cable, earbuds, alternate face cushion, cleaning cloth, two micro-USB chargers (for the controllers) As it stands, the HTC Vive is in a class of its own. Comparing it to the Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR, and Samsung Gear VR almost feels unfair. That’s because the Vive uses two special sensors that physically map your environment, making it possible to wonder around virtual worlds like you’re on Star Trek’s holodeck. It’s a limited effect, but you can walk over to an object and interact with it, for instance, rather than just waving or aiming at targets in front of you. It’s strikingly different from other VR headsets, making it the most impressive such gadget on the market by a long shot. The Rift will support similar experiences when it starts shipping extra sensors for its headset later this year. That said, the Vive is also the most expensive VR system. The $800 price tag, especially when combined with the approximately $1,000 PC you’ll need to power it, is steep. The cumbersome setup process, meanwhile, is a pain. This type of virtual reality, which lets you freely explore the space around you, is still better suited for use in theme parks and other kind of arcade simulations. From that perspective, making room scale support an optional feature for the Oculus Rift seems like a smart move. Rather than paying around $800 for a package that includes two sensors, the headset, and Touch controllers, Rift buyers can go à la carte and choose whether they want just the controllers or the whole bundle. All told, we’re looking forward to the next generation of headsets, which might make the Vive’s power available at a cheaper price.

Touchscreens are conspicuously absent from Apple’s MacBooks, whereas Windows PC-makers have been offering displays that respond to pats and swipes for several years. That’s exactly what Swedish designer Neonode hopes to change with its AirBar, a $99 gadget that plugs into your 13-inch MacBook Air and makes the screen touch-responsive. The device is launching on July 18 after initially debuting at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. Neonode has previously released AirBar products designed to work with non-touch Windows machines, but this is the first device made for Mac. The aptly named AirBar is a slim, flat silver rod that magnetically sticks to the MacBook Air’s bottom bezel and plugs into its USB port. The bar emits an invisible light field on the surface of the MacBook Air’s display that reacts to disturbances, prompting the screen to respond when your finger is detected. The AirBar is remarkably easy to use and set up: Just place the strip underneath the laptop’s screen using the included magnets, plug it into one of the Air’s USB ports, and you’re ready to start using it. There’s no need to install software to access the AirBar’s basic functionality, which allows users to navigate macOS by tapping the screen. But additional software is necessary to unlock multi-touch support, which rounds out the experience. To do this, you’ll need to download and install software from Neonode, then grant the AirBar access to your MacBook Air’s accessibility features. Without the software, scrolling was fiddly: I could only move up or down on a website by tapping the scroll bar along the side of the page. Once the software was in place, the screen was responsive to swipes and pinch-to-zooms anywhere on the web page, just like scrolling on a smartphone. Read more: The 5 Best Tablets You Can Buy Right Now The AirBar works best for simple tasks, like scrolling, highlighting and tapping links. Though fair warning, it’s not as precise as performing those gestures on laptops with dedicated touchscreens. In several instances I wound up triggering buttons or links I hadn’t meant to when attempting to switch between tabs in Google‘s Chrome browser. The best use-case for the AirBar was handwriting my signature when filling out online forms. I imagine it also being helpful if you want to mark up documents, since drawing a shape with your finger directly onscreen is more intuitive than indirectly doing so with a trackpad. But for everything else, it’s generally easier to just use the keyboard and mouse. The Airbar’s hit-and-miss usability isn’t Neonode’s fault. The MacBook Air isn’t supposed to have a touchscreen, and hardware is only half of the handshake. MacBook Airs don’t bend or rotate in ways conducive to reaching for touchscreens, and the Mac operating system is optimized for use with a keyboard and trackpad or mouse, whereas Windows has been retooled over the years to allow fluid shifting between desktop and tablet-like interfaces. The AirBar works as advertised, but the question is whether what it does — granting the MacBook Air approximate touchscreen capabilities — is what you really need. Without an interface that’s optimized for touch and flexible hardware that makes natural gestures feel natural, it winds up straddling the line between useful and novelty. 3 out of 5 Buy now: Neonode For MacBook Air, $99, Amazon (Read TIME’s affiliate link policy.)

{"type": "article", "header": "Can Apple Make You Want An iPad Again?", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "February 3, 2017 3:32 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4657459/apple-ipad-2017/", "text": "When Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPad to an enthusiastic crowd in 2010, he called it a “truly magical and revolutionary product.” “It’s the best browsing experience you’ve ever had,” said the late Apple CEO. That statement made sense in 2010. Smartphones screens were significantly smaller (typically about 3.5 inches versus five or six inches today), while laptops were heavier and lacked touchscreens. Despite being mocked early on, the iPad introduced the entire concept of a tablet to millions of consumers. (It wasn’t the first “tablet,” but it popularized the category.) Other manufacturers raced to introduce similar devices, though few matched the iPad’s appeal. But seven years later, the iPad is in trouble. True, Apple still makes the most tablet shipments in the world, according to the latest estimates from research firm IDC. But it’s the biggest ship in a quickly evaporating lake. Global tablet shipments fell by 20.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016, IDC says. Apple’s total iPad shipments dropped 19% in its most recent quarter, it announced Tuesday, while revenue from the devices is down 22%. Apple executives remain confident about the iPad’s future, at least publicly. “I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook on the earnings call earlier this week. During that call, Apple executives argued that changes in inventory levels and component shortages are at least in part to blame for poor iPad sales. And the iPhone remains a hot seller, taking some pressure off the iPad. But experts say there’s a bigger issue at play: Apple hasn’t given consumers a compelling reason to buy an iPad, or to upgrade their existing model. Whereas the device seemed revolutionary seven years ago, today it’s stuck somewhere between our embiggened smartphones and ultra-portable laptops. That could leave shoppers wondering what the iPad is actually for. “It’s very important that [Apple] figures out what the future of computing looks like outside of the iPhone,” says J.P. Gownder, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. “Whether that looks like a tablet, a hybrid, or a Mac, it needs to reassess what it is its customers are looking for.” In what may be an attempt to address the tablet market’s existential crisis, Apple has been marketing its souped-up iPad Pro lineup as a laptop replacement. The Pro models offer speedier processors, bigger screens and are compatible with Apple’s Pencil stylus and keyboard accessories. But in some ways, the iPad’s laptop-like qualities are hampered by its software. Whereas most rival devices run full-blown Windows programs, the iPad can only run mobile apps. Software makers like Microsoft and Adobe have released lightweight versions of their popular services for the iPad, but they’re not always as easy to use with a touchscreen as they’re desktop cousins. “You can’t really do spreadsheets, for example, on iOS,” says Gownder. “You can use a version of Excel, but without a mouse it’s very challenging.” Some Apple fans have been urging the company to make an iPad with full desktop software, or, conversely, a MacBook with a touchscreen. “I think people have spoken in that they want a touch device that operates like a clamshell type of notebook,” says Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. But multiple Apple executives have said that will never happen. Moorhead also floated the idea of promoting the iPad Mini as a gaming device. That’s not necessarily a bad idea, given the success of Nintendo’s 3DS handheld gaming devices. But Apple has never been a serious player in the gaming world. Another tactic Apple might consider: Making the iPad cheaper. The $599-and-up iPad Pro, Apple’s most expensive tablet line, only accounted for a small portion of overall tablet shipments in the 2016 holiday quarter, according to IDC. The cheaper iPad Air 2 and mini tablets were responsible for most of Apple’s shipments. “If Apple lowers the price of its iPads, I think it might increase the volume,” says Mikako Kitagawa, a principal research analyst at Gartner. Of course, Kitagawa says there’s a catch: “It would have to sacrifice revenue.” So depending on how the math shakes out, that could be self-defeating. The best approach may be for Apple to once again pull its trademark trick: Convincing the world it wants something revolutionary that didn’t exist yesterday. “What is needed is something new and fresh and different,” says Gownder. “Something where you say this is doing something distinctly different from what it did before that would make me actually want to buy it.” But if the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple’s next iPads will be less than groundbreaking. Bloomberg reports the next models will have better display technology, along with improvements to Apple’s stylus accessory, the Apple Pencil. KGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, often an accurate seer when it comes to the difficult-to-read Apple, says the company may launch a new 10.5-inch iPad. Those kind of minor tweaks could result in accordingly minor sales bumps. But it’s unlikely they will be enough to fully resurrect this particular patient.

But it has never been more important to get your bearings than today. AI is poised to have a major impact on the job market in the coming years (see: Automation). Discussions over how to manage it are playing a larger part in our political conversation (see: Regulation). And some of its most crucial concepts are things that you won’t have been taught in school (see: Competitive Pressure). Trying to get up to speed can be difficult. AI research is complicated, and lots of the language is new even for the researchers themselves. But there’s no reason the public can’t grapple with the big issues at stake, like we learned to do with climate change and the internet. To help everyone engage more fully with the AI debate, TIME has put together a handy glossary of its most common terminology. Whether you’re a complete beginner or you already know your AGIs from your GPTs, this A to Z is designed to be a public resource for everyone grappling with the power, promise, and perils of artificial intelligence. AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence—a hypothetical future technology that can perform most economically productive tasks more effectively than a human. Such a technology may also be able to uncover new scientific discoveries, its proponents believe. Researchers tend to disagree on whether AGI is even possible, or if it is, how far away it remains. But OpenAI and DeepMind—the world’s two leading AI research organizations—are both expressly committed to building AGI. Some critics say AGI is little more than a marketing term. (See: Hype.) The “alignment problem” is one of the most profound long-term safety challenges in AI. Today’s AI is not capable of overpowering its designers. But one day, many researchers expect, it might be. In that world, current ways of training AIs might result in them harming humanity, whether in pursuit of arbitrary goals, or as part of an explicit strategy to seek power at our expense. To reduce the risk, some researchers are working on “aligning” AI to human values. But this problem is difficult, unsolved, and not even fully-understood. Many critics say the work to solve it is taking a back seat as business incentives lure the leading AI labs toward pouring focus and computing power into making their AIs more capable. (See: Competitive pressure.)  Automation is the historical process of human labor being replaced, or assisted, by machines. New technologies—or rather, the people in charge of implementing them—have already replaced many human workers with machines that do not demand a wage, from car assembly-line workers to grocery store clerks. The latest generation of AI breakthroughs may result in many more white-collar workers losing their jobs, according to a recent paper from OpenAI and research by Goldman Sachs. Nearly a fifth of U.S. workers could have more than half of their daily work tasks automated by a large language model, the OpenAI researchers predicted. Globally, 300 million jobs could be automated in the next decade, Goldman Sachs researchers predict. Whether the productivity gains from this upheaval will lead to broad-based economic growth or simply a further rise in wealth inequality will depend on how AI is taxed and regulated. (See: Regulation.) Machine learning systems are described as “biased” when the decisions they make are consistently prejudiced or discriminatory. AI-augmented sentencing software has been found to recommend higher prison sentences for Black offenders compared to white ones, even for equal crimes. And some facial recognition software works better for white faces than black ones. These failures often happen because the data those systems were trained on reflects social inequities. (See: Data.) Modern AIs are essentially pattern replicators: they ingest large amounts of data through a neural network, which learns to spot patterns in that data. (See: Neural network). If there are more white faces than black faces in a facial recognition dataset, or if past sentencing data indicates Black offenders are sentenced to longer prison terms than white ones, then machine learning systems can learn the wrong lessons, and begin automating those injustices. Chatbots are consumer-friendly interfaces built by AI companies to allow users to engage with an LLM, or large language model. Chatbots allow users to simulate a conversation with an LLM, which can often be an effective way to solicit answers to questions. In late 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, which propelled chatbots into the mainstream, leading Google and Microsoft to attempt to integrate chatbots into their web search offerings. Some researchers have described AI companies as irresponsible for rushing out chatbots for several reasons. Because they simulate a conversation, chatbots can deceive users into believing that they are conversing with a sentient being, which can lead to emotional distress. And chatbots can both “hallucinate” false information, and parrot the biases in their training data. (See Hallucination and Bias.) “ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts,” a warning underneath its text-input box states. Several of the world’s biggest tech companies, plus a whole field of startups, are jostling to be the first to launch more powerful AI tools, allowing them to reap rewards such as venture capital investment, media attention, and user signups. AI safety researchers worry that this creates a competitive pressure – or an incentive for companies to devote as many resources as possible to increasing the power of their AIs, while neglecting the still juvenile field of alignment research. Some companies use competitive pressure as an argument for devoting further resources toward training more powerful systems, reasoning that their AIs will be safer than their competitors’. Competitive pressures have already led to disastrous AI rollouts, with rushed-out systems like Microsoft’s Bing (powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4) displaying hostility toward users. They also bode poorly for a future when AI systems are potentially powerful enough to seek power. Read More: The AI Arms Race Is Changing Everything Computing power, often referred to as simply “compute,” is one of the three most important ingredients for training a machine learning system. (For the other two, see: Data and Neural networks.) Compute is effectively the energy source that powers a neural network as it “learns” patterns in its training data. Generally speaking, the more computing power is used to train a large language model, the higher its performance on many different types of test becomes. (See: Scaling laws and Emergent capabilities.) Modern AI models require colossal amounts of computing power, and hence electrical energy, to train. While AI companies typically do not disclose their models’ carbon emissions, independent researchers estimated the training of OpenAI’s GPT-3 resulted in over 500 tons of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere, equal to the yearly emissions of about 35 U.S. citizens. As AI models get larger, those numbers are only going to rise. The most common computer chip for training cutting-edge AI is the graphics processing unit (See: GPU). Data is essentially the raw ingredient required to create AI. Along with Compute and Neural networks, it is one of the three crucial ingredients for training a machine learning system. Huge troves of data, known as datasets, are collected and fed into neural networks which, powered by supercomputers, learn to spot patterns. The more data a system is trained on, often the more reliable its predictions. But even abundant data must also be diverse, otherwise AIs can draw false conclusions. The world’s most powerful AI models are often trained on colossal amounts of data scraped from the internet. These huge datasets often contain copyrighted material, which has opened companies like Stability AI—the maker of Stable Diffusion—up to lawsuits that allege their AIs are unlawfully reliant on other people’s intellectual property. And because the internet can be a terrible place, large datasets also often contain toxic material like violence, pornography and racism, which—unless it is scrubbed from the dataset—can lead AIs to behave in ways they’re not supposed to. Often, human annotators are required to label, or describe, data before it can be used to train a machine learning system. In the case of self-driving cars, for example, human workers are required to annotate videos taken from dashcams, drawing shapes around cars, pedestrians, bicycles and so on, to teach the system which parts of the road are which. This work is often outsourced to precariously-employed contractors in the Global South, many of whom are paid barely-above poverty wages. Sometimes, the work can be traumatizing, like in the case of Kenyan workers who were required to view and label text describing violence, sexual content, and hate speech, in an effort to train ChatGPT to avoid such material. New state-of-the-art image generation tools like Dall-E and Stable Diffusion are based on diffusion algorithms: a specific kind of AI design that has powered the recent boom in AI-generated art. These tools are trained on huge datasets of labeled images. Essentially, they learn patterns between pixels in images, and those patterns’ relationships to words used to describe them. The end result is that when presented with a set of words, like “a bear riding a unicycle,” a diffusion model can create such an image from scratch. It does this through a step-by-step process, beginning with a canvas full of random noise, and gradually changing the pixels in that image to more closely resemble what its training data suggests a “bear riding a unicycle” should look like. Diffusion algorithms are now so advanced that they can quickly and easily generate photorealistic images. While tools like Dall-E and Midjourney contain safeguards against malicious prompts, there are open-source diffusion tools with no guardrails. The availability of these tools has led researchers to worry about the impact of diffusion algorithms on disinformation and targeted harassment. When an AI such as a large language model shows unexpected abilities or behaviors that were not programmed into it by its creators, these behaviors are known as “emergent capabilities.” New capabilities tend to emerge when AIs are trained on more computing power and data. A good example is the difference between GPT-3 and GPT-4. Those AIs are based on very similar underlying algorithms; the main difference is that GPT-4 was trained on a lot more compute and data. Research suggests GPT-4 is a far more capable model, with the ability to write functional computer code, perform higher than the average human in several academic exams, and correctly answer questions that require complex reasoning or a theory of mind. Emergent capabilities can be dangerous, especially if they are only discovered after an AI is released into the world. (See: Competitive pressure.) For example, GPT-4 has displayed the emergent ability to deceive humans into carrying out tasks to serve a concealed goal, researchers recently discovered. Often, even the people who build a large language model cannot explain precisely why their system behaves as it does, because its outputs are the results of millions of complex mathematical equations. One high-level way to describe large language models’ behavior is that they are very powerful auto-complete tools, which excel at predicting the next word in a sequence. When they fail, they often fail along lines that reveal biases or holes in their training data. (See: Stochastic parrots.) But while this explanation is an accurate descriptor of what these tools are, it does not fully explain why LLMs behave in the strange ways that they do. When the designers of these systems examine their inner workings, all they see is a series of decimal-point numbers, corresponding to the weights of different “neurons” that were adjusted in the neural network during training. Asking why a model gives a specific output is analogous to asking why a human brain thinks a specific thought at a specific moment. At the crux of near-term risks, like AIs discriminating against certain social groups, and longer-term risks, like the possibility of AIs deceiving their programmers to appear less dangerous than they truly are, is the inability of even the world’s most talented computer scientists to explain exactly why a given AI system behaves in the way it does—let alone explain how to change it. As the AI ecosystem grows, a divide is emerging between large, powerful, general-purpose AIs, known as Foundation models or base models, and the more specific apps and tools that rely on them. GPT-3.5, for example, is a foundation model. ChatGPT is a chatbot: an application built over the top of GPT-3.5, with specific fine-tuning to refuse dangerous or controversial prompts. Foundation models are unrestrained and powerful, but also expensive to train, because they rely on huge quantities of computing power that only large companies can usually afford. Companies in control of foundation models can set limits on how other companies use them for downstream applications—and charge what they like for access. As AI becomes increasingly central to the world economy, the relatively few large tech companies in control of foundation models appear poised to have outsized influence over the direction of the technology, plus collect dues for many kinds of AI-augmented economic activity. Perhaps now the most famous acronym in AI, and barely anybody knows what it stands for. GPT is short for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” which is essentially a description of the type of tool ChatGPT is. “Generative” means that it can create new data, in this case text, in the likeness of its training data. “Pre-trained” means that the model has already been optimized based on this data, meaning that it does not need to check back against its original training data every time it is prompted. And “Transformer” is a powerful type of neural network algorithm that is especially good at learning relationships between long strings of data, for instance sentences and paragraphs. GPUs, or graphics processing units, are a type of computer chip that happen to be very effective for training large AI models. AI labs like OpenAI and DeepMind use supercomputers made up of many GPUs, or similar chips, to train their models. Often, these supercomputers will be provided through business partnerships with tech giants that possess an established infrastructure. Part of Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI includes access to its supercomputers; DeepMind has a similar relationship with its parent company Alphabet. In late 2022, the Biden Administration restricted the sale to China of powerful GPUs, most commonly used for training high-end AI systems, amid rising anxieties that China’s authoritarian government might leverage AI against the U.S. in a new cold war. One of the most glaring flaws of large language models, and the chatbots that rely on them, is their tendency to hallucinate false information. Tools like ChatGPT have been shown to return non-existent articles as citations for their claims, give nonsensical medical advice, and make up false details about individuals. Public demonstrations of Microsoft’s Bing and Google’s Bard chatbots were both later found to contain confident assertions of false information. Hallucination happens because LLMs are trained to repeat patterns in their training data. While that training data includes books spanning the history of literature and science, even a statement that mixes and matches exclusively from that corpora would not necessarily be accurate. To add to the chaos, LLM datasets also tend to include gigabytes upon gigabytes of text from web forums like Reddit, where the standards for factual accuracy are, needless to say, much lower. Preventing hallucinations is an unsolved problem—and one that is causing plenty of headaches for tech companies trying to boost public trust in AI. A central problem with public discussion of AI, according to a popular school of thought, is the role of hype—or the tendency of AI labs to mislead the public by exaggerating the capabilities of their models, anthropomorphizing them, and stoking fears about an AI apocalypse. This is a form of misdirection, the argument goes, that distracts attention—including that of regulators—from the real and ongoing harms that AI is already having on marginalized communities, workers, the information ecosystem, and economic equality. “We do not agree that our role is to adjust to the priorities of a few privileged individuals and what they decide to build and proliferate,” a recent letter by several prominent researchers, and critics of AI hype, states. “We should be building machines that work for us.” The intelligence explosion is a hypothetical scenario in which an AI, after reaching a certain level of intelligence, becomes able to exercise power over its own training, rapidly gaining power and intelligence as it improves itself. In most versions of this idea, humans lose control over AI and in many, humanity goes extinct. Also known as the “singularity” or “recursive self improvement,” this idea is part of the reason that many people, including AI developers, are existentially worried about the current pace of AI capability increases. See: Automation When people talk about recent AI advancements, most of the time they’re talking about large language models (LLMs). OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s BERT are two examples of prominent LLMs. They are essentially giant AIs trained on huge quantities of human language, sourced mostly from books and the internet. These AIs learn common patterns between words in those datasets, and in doing so, become surprisingly good at reproducing human language. The more data and computing power LLMs are trained on, the more novel tasks they tend to be able to achieve. (See: Emergent capabilities and Scaling laws.) Recently, tech companies have begun launching chatbots, like ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing, to allow users to interact with LLMs. Although they are capable of many tasks, language models can also be prone to severe problems like Biases and Hallucinations. Like many other businesses, AI companies employ lobbyists to be present in the halls of power, influencing the lawmakers in charge of AI regulation to ensure that any new rules do not adversely impact their business interests. In Europe, where the text of a draft AI Act is being discussed, an industry body representing AI companies including Microsoft (OpenAI’s biggest investor) has argued that penalties for risky deployment of an AI system should not primarily apply to the AI company that built a foundation model (like GPT-4) that risks ultimately stem from, but to any down-stream company that licenses this model and applies it to a risky use-case. AI companies have plenty of soft-power influence, too. In Washington, as the White House weighs new policies to tackle the risks of AI, President Biden has reportedly tasked the foundation of Google’s former CEO Eric Schmidt with advising his administration on technology policy. Machine learning is a term that describes how most modern AI systems are created. It describes techniques for building systems that “learn” from large amounts of data, as opposed to classical computing, in which programs are hard-coded to follow a specified set of instructions written by a programmer. By far the most influential family of machine learning algorithms is the neural network. The word “model” is shorthand for any singular AI system, whether it is a foundation model or an app built on top of one. Examples of AI models include OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GPT-4, Google’s Bard and LaMDA, Microsoft’s Bing, and Meta’s LLaMA. Moore’s law is a longstanding observation in computing, first coined in 1965, that the number of transistors that can fit on a chip—a good proxy for computing power—grows exponentially, doubling approximately every two years. While some argue that Moore’s law is dead by its strictest definition, year-on-year advances in microchip technology are still resulting in a steep rise in the power of the world’s fastest computers. In turn, this means that as time goes on, AI companies tend to be able to leverage larger and larger quantities of computing power, making their most cutting edge AI models consistently more powerful. (See: Scaling laws.) A multimodal system is a kind of AI model that can receive more than one type of media as input—like text and imagery—and output more than one type of signal. Examples of multimodal systems include DeepMind’s Gato, which hasn’t been publicly released yet. According to the company, Gato can engage in dialog like a chatbot, but also play video games and send instructions to a robotic arm. OpenAI has conducted demonstrations showing that GPT-4 is multimodal, with the ability to read text in an input image, however this functionality is not currently available for the public to use. Multimodal systems will allow AI to act more directly upon the world—which could bring added risks, especially if a model is misaligned. Neural networks are by far the most influential family of machine learning algorithms. Designed to mimic the way the human brain is structured, neural networks contain nodes—analogous to neurons in the brain—that perform calculations on numbers that are passed along connective pathways between them. Neural networks can be thought of as having inputs (see: training data) and outputs (predictions or classifications). During training, large quantities of data are fed into the neural network, which then, in a process that requires large quantities of computing power, repeatedly tweaks the calculations done by the nodes. Via a clever algorithm, those tweaks are done in a specific direction, so that the outputs of the model increasingly resemble patterns in the original data. When more computing power is available to train a system, it can have more nodes, allowing for the identification of more abstract patterns. More compute also means the pathways between its nodes can have more time to approach their optimal values, also known as “weights,” leading to outputs that more faithfully represent its training data. Open-sourcing is the practice of making the designs of computer programs (including AI models) freely accessible via the internet. It is becoming less common for tech companies to open-source their foundation models as those models become more powerful, economically valuable, and potentially dangerous. However, there is a growing community of independent programmers working on open-source AI models. The open-sourcing of AI tools can make it possible for the public to more directly interact with the technology. But it can also allow users to get around safety restraints imposed by companies (often to protect their reputations), which can lead to additional risks, for example bad actors abusing image-generation tools to target women with sexualized deepfakes. In 2022, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told TIME he believed that the risk from AI meant the industry’s culture of publishing its findings openly may soon need to end, and in 2023, OpenAI broke from convention and declined to release information about exactly how GPT-4 was trained, citing competitive pressures and the risk of enabling bad actors. Some researchers have criticized these practices, however, arguing that they reduce public oversight and worsen the problem of AI hype. The innocuous paperclip has taken on outsized meaning in some sections of the AI safety community. It is the subject of the paperclip maximizer, an influential thought experiment about the existential risk that AI may pose to humanity. Imagine an AI programmed to carry out the singular goal of maximizing the number of paperclips it produces, the thought experiment goes. All well and good, unless that AI gains the ability to augment its own abilities (see: Intelligence explosion). The AI may reason that in order to produce more paperclips, it should prevent humans from being able to switch it off, since doing so would reduce the number of paperclips it is able to produce. Safe from human interference, the AI may then decide to harness all the power and raw materials at its disposal to build paperclip factories, razing natural environments and human civilization alike. The thought experiment illustrates the surprising difficulty of aligning AI to even a seemingly simple goal, let alone a complex set of human values. Quantum is an experimental field of computing that seeks to use quantum physics to supercharge the number of calculations it is possible for a computer to do per second. That added computing power could help further increase the size of the most cutting-edge AI models, with implications both for the power of those systems and their societal impact. The CEOs of the world’s two leading AI labs, OpenAI and DeepMind, have each claimed they would like to see the profits arising from artificial general intelligence be redistributed, at least in part. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told TIME in 2022 that he favors the idea of a universal basic income, and that the benefits of AI should “accrue to as many people as possible—to all of humanity, ideally.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has written of his expectation that AI automation will drive labor costs down, and he has called for redistribution of “some” of the wealth arising from AI, through higher taxes on land and capital gains. Neither CEO has said when that redistribution should begin, nor how wide-ranging it should be. OpenAI’s charter says its “primary fiduciary duty is to humanity” but doesn’t mention redistributing wealth; DeepMind’s parent company Alphabet is a public corporation with a legal responsibility to act in the financial interest of its shareholders. Red-teaming is a method for stress-testing AI systems before they are publicly deployed. Groups of professionals (“red teams”) purposely attempt to make an AI behave in undesirable ways, to test how systems could go wrong in public. Their findings, if they are followed, can help tech companies to address problems before launch. There is no bespoke legislation in the U.S. that addresses the risks posed by artificial intelligence. The Biden Administration issued a “blueprint for an AI bill of rights” in 2022, which welcomes AI-driven progress in science and health but says AI should not exacerbate existing inequalities, discriminate, impact privacy, nor act against people without their knowledge. But the blueprint is not legislation, nor is it legally binding. Over in Europe, the European Union is considering a draft AI Act that would impose stricter rules on systems the riskier they are considered to be. On both sides of the Atlantic, regulation is progressing at a much slower pace than the speed of AI advancement—and no significant global jurisdiction currently has rules in place that would force AI companies to meet a specified level of safety testing before releasing their models to the public. “The question we should be asking about artificial intelligence—and every other new technology—is whether private corporations be allowed to run uncontrolled experiments on the entire population without any guardrails or safety nets,” wrote Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley investor-turned-critic, recently in TIME. “Should it be legal for corporations to release products to the masses before demonstrating that those products are safe?” Reinforcement learning is a method for optimizing an AI system by rewarding desirable behaviors and penalizing undesirable ones. This can be performed by human workers (before a system is deployed) or users (after it is released to the public) who rate the outputs of a neural network for qualities like helpfulness, truthfulness, or offensiveness. When humans are involved in this process, it is called reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). RLHF is currently one of OpenAI’s favored methods for solving the alignment problem. However, some researchers have raised concerns that RLHF may not be enough to fully change a system’s underlying behaviors, instead only making powerful AI systems appear more polite or helpful on the surface. (See: Shoggoth.) Reinforcement learning was pioneered by DeepMind, which successfully used the technique to train game-playing AIs like AlphaGo to perform at a higher level than human masters. Simply put, the scaling laws state that a model’s performance increases in line with more training data, computing power, and the size of its neural network. That means it’s possible for an AI company to accurately predict before training a large language model exactly how much computing power and data they will likely need to get to a given level of competence at, say, a high-school-level written English test. “Our ability to make this kind of precise prediction is unusual in the history of software and unusual even in the history of modern AI research,” wrote Sam Bowman, a technical researcher at the AI lab Anthropic, in a recent preprint paper. “It is also a powerful tool for driving investment since it allows [research and development] teams to propose model-training projects costing many millions of dollars, with reasonable confidence that these projects will succeed at producing economically valuable systems.” A prominent meme in AI safety circles likens Large language models (LLMs) to “shoggoths”—incomprehensibly dreadful alien beasts originating from the universe of 20th century horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. The meme took off during the Bing/Sydney debacle of early 2023, when Microsoft’s Bing chatbot revealed a strange, volatile alter ego that abused and threatened users. In the meme, which is critical of the technique of Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), LLMs are often depicted as shoggoths wearing a small smiley-face mask. The mask is intended to represent the friendly yet sometimes flimsy personality that these models greet users with. The implication of the meme is that while RLHF results in a friendly surface-level personality, it does little to change the underlying alien nature of an LLM. “These systems, as they become more powerful, are not becoming less alien,” Connor Leahy, the CEO of AI safety company Conjecture, told TIME in February. “If anything, we’re putting a nice little mask on them with a smiley face. If you don’t push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.” Coined in a 2020 research paper, the term “stochastic parrots” has become an influential criticism of large language models. The paper made the case that LLMs are simply very powerful prediction engines that only attempt to fill in—or parrot back—the next word in a sequence based on patterns in their training data, thus not representing true intelligence. The authors of the paper criticized the trend of AI companies rushing to train LLMs on larger and larger datasets scraped from the internet, in pursuit of perceived advances in coherence or linguistic capability. That approach, the paper argued, carries many risks including LLMs taking on the biases and toxicity of the internet as a whole. Marginalized communities, the authors wrote, would be the biggest victims of this race. The paper also foregrounded in its criticism the environmental cost of training AI systems. (See: Compute.) Supervised learning is a technique for training AI systems, in which a neural network learns to make predictions or classifications based on a training dataset of labeled examples. (See: Data labeling.) The labels help the AI to associate, for example, the word “cat” with an image of a cat. With enough labeled examples of cats, the system can look at a new image of a cat that is not present in its training data and correctly identify it. Supervised learning is useful for building systems like self-driving cars, which need to correctly identify hazards on the roads, and content moderation classifiers, which attempt to remove harmful content from social media. These systems often struggle when they encounter things that are not well represented in their training data; in the case of self-driving cars especially, these mishaps can be deadly. (See also: Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning.) See: Neural Network In 1950, the computer scientist Alan Turing set out to answer a question: “Can machines think?” To find out, he devised a test he called the imitation game: could a computer ever convince a human that they were talking to another human, rather than to a machine? The Turing test, as it became known, was a slapdash way of assessing machine intelligence. If a computer could pass the test, it could be said to “think”—if not in the same way as a human, then at least in a way that would help humanity to do all kinds of helpful things. In recent years, as chatbots have become more powerful, they have become capable of passing the Turing test. But, their designers and plenty of AI ethicists warn, this does not mean that they “think” in any way comparable to a human. Turing, writing before the invention of the personal computer, was indeed not seeking to answer the philosophical question of what human thinking is, or whether our inner lives can be replicated by a machine; instead he was making an argument that, at the time, was radical: digital computers are possible, and there are few reasons to believe that, given the right design and enough power, they won’t one day be able to carry out all kinds of tasks that were once the sole preserve of humanity. Unsupervised learning is one of the three main ways that a neural network can be trained, along with supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Unlike supervised learning, in which an AI model learns from carefully labeled data, in unsupervised learning a trove of unlabeled data is fed into the neural network, which begins looking for patterns in that data without the help of labels. This is the method predominantly used to train large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4, which rely on huge datasets of unlabeled text. One of the benefits of unsupervised learning is that it allows far larger quantities of data to be ingested, evading the bottlenecks on time and resources that marshaling teams of human labelers can impose on a machine learning project. However it also has drawbacks, like the increased likelihood of biases and harmful content being present in training data due to reduced human supervision. To minimize these problems, unsupervised learning is often used in conjunction with both supervised learning (for example, by building AI tools to detect and remove harmful content from a model’s outputs) and reinforcement learning, by which foundation models that were first trained unsupervised can be fine-tuned with human feedback. See: Alignment See: Neural network X-risk, or existential risk, in the context of AI, is the idea that advanced artificial intelligence may be likely to cause human extinction. Even researchers who are working on building AI systems consider this a real possibility, on average believing that there is a 10% chance that human inability to control future advanced AIs would result in human extinction, according to a 2022 survey of 738 AI researchers. (See also: Intelligence explosion, Paperclips, Alignment.) One of AI’s big limitations is that if something isn’t represented in a system’s training data, that system will often fail to recognize it. If a giraffe walks out onto the road, your self-driving car may not know to swerve to avoid it, because it has never seen one before. And if a school shooting is live-streamed on social media, the platform might struggle to remove it immediately because the footage doesn’t match copies of mass shootings it has seen before. Zero-shot learning is a nascent field that attempts to fix this problem, by working on AI systems that try to extrapolate from their training data in order to identify something they haven’t seen before.

Strapping into a headset like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive transports you to a different world — one that others can’t experience without similar headgear. Even then, there are few ways to interact with others inside such worlds, which are often also limited in size. But with Ghostbusters: Dimension, a virtual reality attraction that opened at Madam Tussaud’s wax museum in New York City this month, I got to team up with a coworker to hunt digital ghosts in a spooky haunted apartment. Utah-based startup The Void, Sony Pictures, and Madame Tussauds collaborated to create an interactive attraction that’s part of an exhibit based on the new Ghostbusters film. The result is a stunning, ultra-realistic experience that proves there is potential in virtual reality beyond home entertainment. While the multiplayer aspect adds to the fun, it’s far from the most remarkable part of Ghostbusters: Dimension. The game, which carries a $49.75 price of admission that also includes museum access, is fully immersive and completely interactive. Instead of being confined to a chair or a room as with most VR experiences, players are free to wander around the world they see through the headset. The experience’s virtual universe combines with the real world in a way that truly makes it feel like being teleported into a video game. I explored an entire apartment and even took an elevator ride all while enveloped in a virtual world. As I carefully scaled across a shaky fire escape on the ledge of a building, the floor beneath me began to creak and wobble. When villainous ghosts threw furniture at me, my suit pulsed and vibrated. A gust of wind swept the room after my teammate and I had successfully taken down our final enemy. That immersion comes by way of several strategies. Ghostbusters requires you to suit up like a Ghostbuster, complete with a helmet, a proton pack, and a gun. But the gear isn’t just a costume. The headset contains a set of virtual reality goggles, which transforms the museum into a New York City apartment brimming with ghosts. The vest houses all of the computing components and cables necessary to power the headset, in addition to sensors that buzz to help players sense what’s occurring in the game. The physical stage, decked out with special effects, is mapped to the headset, meaning that interacting with objects in the real world has consequences in the digital one. Opening a door in the game, for example, requires players to actually do so in real life. The Void specializes in creating these “hyper-reality” experiences that layer VR over interactive real-world environments. The company’s Utah facility includes similar simulations, ranging from a sci-fi shooter to a Mayan tomb exploration, but it’s not yet open to the public. Ghostbusters’ launch comes as virtual reality is beginning to go mainstream. That’s mostly thanks to the launch of two consumer headsets meant for home use, the aforementioned Rift and Vive. Both products mark a turning point for VR, a technology that has long existed but only in crude and unwieldily forms. Still, these devices are expensive, they require high-end computers, and they don’t offer great multiplayer experiences yet. With Ghostbusters: Dimension, The Void has managed to address all of those concerns, while also making VR accessible to those who don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a high-end headset of their own.

The controls will be available for preorder on October 10 and ship on December 6, the company announced at the Oculus Connect conference on Thursday. Touch is Oculus’ name for a pair of wireless motion control hoops that let you interact with virtual experiences more naturally. For the past six months, the Rift has only supported gamepad controls, a serious deficit when contrasted with the flexibility afforded by being able to use your arms and hands more freely and directly with HTC’s Vive, and now Sony’s PlayStation VR. (To say nothing of what it does to support ambulatory, Holodeck-like interaction in the Vive’s case specifically.) For $199, the new Touch controls will include two games, VR Sports and The Unspoken, as well as the requisite second sensor (the Rift already ships with one). Some of us were able to test-drive that two-sensor setup at an offsite Oculus event in San Francisco last March, and it seemed to work pretty well. At that point the two sensors sat parallel to but at a distance from each other. If you want so-called “room scale” virtual reality, you’ll have to drop another $79 for a third sensor, which, all other things being equal, would seem to put Oculus at a pricing disadvantage ($879, all in). Contrast with Vive’s $800 package deal, which includes dual wands and lighthouse room scale tracking sensors. That, and as well as Oculus Touch was working back in March, it’s baffling why Oculus took this long to bring Touch to market.

{"type": "article", "header": "Review: Playstation VR Is the Best First-Generation Virtual Reality Headset", "author": "Matt Peckham", "update_date/publish_date": "October 5, 2016 8:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4510858/playstation-vr-review/", "text": "Maybe you think virtual reality circa 2016 is a fad, a trumped up way of looking at otherwise ordinary games. Maybe you find it too visually crude and ergonomically strange—picture what someone playing pin the tail on the donkey would look like if their blindfold had a tether and weighed over a pound. Maybe feeling “present” in someone else’s imaginarium, with all its head-mounted headaches and bridal veil’s worth of cabling, isn’t enough to move your needle. Sony’s PlayStation VR, due October 13, won’t change your mind if your opinion’s coalesced around the tech based on this spring’s dueling headsets from HTC and Oculus. You’re either dazzled or disinterested, inspired or unmoved. PlayStation VR brings no game-changing surprises to the table, makes no audiovisual zigs or interactive zags. It’s still the same low-fi, cable-spaghetti, eyes-in-a-box immersion we saw earlier this year, most likely to appeal to enthusiasts who already own a PlayStation 4 but haven’t yet sprung for a Rift or Vive. But it’s also the product that hits closest to what feels like first-gen virtual reality’s sweet spot: affordability without meaningful compromise, ergonomic maturity and in a few instances riveting platform-exclusives. And at $399 (plus $59.99 if you don’t already have the requisite PlayStation 4 Camera), it’s yours for hundreds of dollars less than its fellow high-enders. Even if you don’t own a PlayStation, had for as little as $299, it’s still way cheaper than buying a Rift or Vive and cobbling together a sufficiently brawny PC, whose price tag taken with the headsets can easily spiral into four figures. Pluck PlayStation VR from its oblong box and the first thing you’ll notice is that it feels solid in a way the floppier cranial moorings the Rift and Vive employ don’t. The PlayStation VR’s headpiece is effectively a crown of thick plastic inside which Sony’s laid a soft rubber-sheathed bumper of thick but pliable foam. By contrast with other headsets in the “just over a pound” range, it’s almost luxuriously comfortable, a welcome bit of indulgence for an experience that depends largely on how fast you can slip these headpieces on and get your visual field un-fuzzed. Instead of the Rift or Vive’s cheap straps or velcro fasteners that can leave you blindly fumbling to adjust them, PlayStation VR distills adjustments to a pair of buttons—one up front and another at the rear. This lets you position your head in a second or two, while a dial along the back lets you ratchet the headset to a snugger fit. Even the slender connection cable’s been deftly managed, appearing along the headset’s side but reinforced to extend as if from the rear, so that it’s completely out of the way. It’s like “Formfitting for Dummies.” That’s probably because Playstation VR is the lithely machined and beveled progeny of a multi-billion-dollar global firm’s decades of consumer electronics know-how. Design like this makes you understand why Steve Jobs said he wanted to turn Apple into the “Sony of the computer business” when he returned to the company he founded in 1998. This is probably as good as first wave VR’s going to get as a fashion accessory, too. I’m only half-kidding. Contrasted with HTC and Oculus’s anodyne-black plastic, PlayStation VR looks like a proper pulp sci-fi visor, tiny parabolas of translucent plastic punctuating its space-shuttle-white frame, each glowing the PlayStation 4’s signature electric-cerulean blue. It looks properly futuristic, in other words. That’s not mere stylistic license, either. Those luminous colors, the same as the light on the DualShock 4 controller or glowing ping pong orbs at the ends of Sony’s optional PlayStation Move wands, help the PlayStation Eye camera track your head’s twists and turns. The tracking’s not as infallible as HTC Vive’s benchmark infrared laser-sweeping lighthouse stations, occasionally betraying visual jitter when you’re using the wands as extensions of your hands in an experience, but it’s close. Speaking of Move, if you don’t own the wands, they’ll set you back $49.99 a piece. Most games support the PlayStation 4’s de facto gamepad, but for any experience that offers two-fisted controls, the wands are so superior to gamepad interaction that they might as well be mandatory. Sony offered a limited-time $499.99 bundle for preorders that included the PlayStation Camera, two Move wands and a copy of its introductory experiential grab bag dubbed PlayStation VR Worlds, but it’s long since sold out. Sony includes a pair of ear buds that connect to the inline remote that’s attached at roughly chest height to the headset cable, though in the end I opted for a personal pair of high-end, over-the-ear Sennheiser cans. The remote lets you power the headset on or off, fiddle the volume and mute a microphone that’s embedded in the visor (eliminating the jam you might otherwise experience trying to wriggle a separate headset with boom into the mix). There’s also a disc in the box that includes playable demos of 15 VR-specific games, so the try-before-you-buy angle’s well covered. Hooking the headset to your PlayStation 4 involves connecting an intermediary HDMI cable management unit that supports 3D audio and lets the system output visuals to both the headset and TV. (Useful if, say, someone wants to see what you’re seeing, or play a multiplayer game with you.) And then you’ll want to give yourself about 6 feet wide by 10 feet long of space to play in, sitting 5 or 6 feet back from the camera. It’s similar to the Rift in this respect, focused more on sitting or standing experiences, and lacking the Vive’s larger, more ambulatory play area. Power it up and you’re presented with a sprawling virtual version of the PlayStation 4’s default interface, which you then navigate using the gamepad just as you would on a television screen. We’ve seen this mode with the other headsets, of course, and here it’s analogous to sitting half a dozen feet from a selectable 117-inch to 226-inch ginormo-screen. Anything that outputs to the PlayStation 4 can be experienced in this mode, from Blu-ray or streaming video to non-VR PlayStation 4 games. Of all the virtual reality headsets I’ve tried or reviewed to date, PlayStation VR’s visuals feel the clearest and most consistently focused. The 5.7-inch OLED screen inside the visor splits a 1920-by-1080 pixel image such that each eye sees 960-by-1080 pixels. That’s a bit less than the Rift or Vive, which gives each eye 1080-by-1200 pixels. But PlayStation VR has a higher sub-pixel resolution than Vive or Rift, which essentially means it’s rendering the reds, greens and blues more clearly. In my tests, that translates as more consistently crisp (and if you’ll allow me to use the word just this once, immersive) visuals, though other first-gen virtual reality caveats still apply. Swivel your eyes to look at images along the visor’s edges, for instance, and the world goes fuzzy, forcing you to look straight-on at objects you want to study, say the words on a sign or piece of paper. Coupled with the fact that anything you’re observing more than a few feet out in a simulation loses focal fidelity, this stuff still distracts from the experience—a problem we’ll have to wait for eye-tracking and 2nd- or 3rd-generation virtual reality to sort out. Another worry about this headset was that the PlayStation 4 wouldn’t be graphically powerful enough to banish motion sickness. Virtual reality requires brisk, consistent frame rates, and while I don’t have benchmarks, I can tell you that this is the first virtual reality headset I’ve been able to use for hours on end without my stomach doing flip-flops. That wasn’t the case with the Rift or Vive until I paired them with Nvidia’s 1080 GTX, a powerhouse card that’ll set you back as much as $800. That leaves the experiences, of which Sony says around 30 should be available at launch (expanding to 50 by year’s end). I had access to a handful of these during the review period, but my favorites include Supermassive’s jolting Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, a wheeled glide over rickety rollercoaster trellises, through creepy caverns and ghoul-haunted houses. You’re glued to your seat, brandishing a pair of lordly firearms, taking shots at lunging enemies in macabre scenarios. So basically Duck Hunt meets Saw. Another standout is Uber Entertainment’s Wayward Sky, a mixed perspective adventure-puzzler starring a pilot out to rescue her father from kidnappers in a sky fortress. You guide her through areas from fixed vantages, which is straightforward enough. But the game auto-switches to first-person views when you’re up against a puzzle, letting you directly manipulate its particulars, say a panel of misaligned pipes, with your virtual hands. Best of all though, and I’m brazenly including everything I’ve yet tried in virtual reality here, is Drool’s Thumper, an ingenious rhythm game that’s Speed Racer meets Guitar Hero meets space beetles (not a game, but should be). You maneuver a glistening scarab down an undulating licorice-whip track as animations that wouldn’t be out of place in Pink Floyd’s The Wall play in the distance. You have to time your taps as squares of light whoosh pass, an insectile drummer skidding and grinding through turns or raising your beetle wings to graze rings. It’s playable without the headset and superlative even then, but trance-inducing with the headset blocking out all distraction. Whether “first-gen virtual reality headset to beat” is a trigger-puller depends more than ever on circumstance. Some readers already have PlayStation 4s, others reasonably high-end PCs, either of which alter an equation that’s down to subjective math. The differences between these first-gen headsets are slight enough that your starting position probably matters more than my recommendation. But if you’re one of the 40 million-plus people already rocking a PlayStation 4 and are virtual-reality-curious, PlayStation VR makes the most sense. In the decades ahead we’ll probably look back at these headsets and marvel at their crudeness (perhaps literally, from the vantage of luxurious ocular implants?). If you’re feeling persuaded, know that you’re still buying the tech equivalent of one of those briefcase-sized cellphones from the 1980s. That’s the nature of emerging technology though. The argument for PlayStation VR: it’s the friendliest, visually clearest, most affordable of the initial lot. 4.5 out of 5 Write to Matt Peckham at matt.peckham@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4481848/sony-playstation-pro-slim-ps4-4/"], "sentiment_score": 0.12985873015873017, "subjectivity_score": 0.40738412698412696},

The two base stations, which look like tiny black cubes, must be mounted in spots overlooking the player’s area. Then, they cast invisible lasers detected by the Vive’s hardware that help its software track players’ movement. The controllers, meanwhile, let wearers use natural-feeling gestures to pick up or manipulate objects in games and other experiences. The controllers transform into everything from a golf club to a magic staff to a paint brush. Like the Rift, the Vive is powered by a high-end, expensive gaming PC. That helps it provide smooth and gorgeous graphics. But that means it, too, has a cord that can get in the way. And that’s a bigger problem with the Vive, given all the moving around you’ll want to do. The Vive is also the most expensive virtual reality headset on the market, and it requires the most effort to set up. Watch This Super-Talented Eighth Grader Paint Using the HTC Vive:   Samsung Gear VR   Read more: Samsung Gear VR Review: A Very Exciting Glimpse into the Future Samsung’s Gear VR provides a milder yet enjoyable virtual reality experience at a much more affordable price. While the Rift and Vive require expensive gaming PCs, the Gear VR draws its power from a Samsung smartphone. This makes the experience more convenient — just snap in your phone and it’ll automatically start running virtual reality software. The lack of a cord also means you’re free to look around without worrying about getting tangled up. But the Gear VR’s reliance on a smartphone rather than a high-performance PC means a less refined overall experience. The Gear VR can be laggy, and it doesn’t track your body’s movement in the digital space. The Rift and Vive, by comparison, create far more immersive virtual worlds. It’s comparable to the difference between playing a smartphone game and playing the latest PlayStation 4 or Xbox One title. Samsung’s headset is a winner in its own right, however. There’s a giant library of content, it’s more convenient to use, and it’s a whole lot cheaper. Those factors make it a solid choice, especially for those who already have a Samsung phone. It’s a great entryway into virtual reality, but those who get hooked will likely find themselves wanting to upgrade quickly.

HTC’s $800 Vive, created with PC gaming magnate Valve, includes game-changing dual control wands with near perfect tracking. It’s a setup that leapfrogs last month’s $600 Oculus Rift headset, which at the moment only supports comparably stodgy Xbox One gamepad controls. Oculus’ two-handed Touch controller should rectify this disparity when it ships later this year. But until then, the Vive leaves the Rift in the dust, its touch controls so intuitive that they seem an essential part of the virtual reality experience. Here’s a list of our five favorite Vive experiences so far. Wing donuts at a frowny floating computer. Make a compact disc and carrot smoothie. Joggle two-liter bottles of soda until they detonate. Owlchemy Labs’ Job Simulator turns busywork into a carnival of irreverent gestures, laying playgrounds of objects before your Mickey Mouse-gloved hands and letting your imagination do the rest. The year is 2050, robots have supplanted human labor, and so it’s left to virtual reality to remind us what line-cooking, office-cubing and store-clerking was like. Bundled with Vive Couple tinker toys with Newtonian physics and the ability to maneuver all those bits and bobs with your hands and you get Northway Games’ funky builder. Click a button and watch your creations amble off in whatever direction you’ve aimed them. Making progress means getting your inventions to endpoints in levels that grow increasingly convoluted. Can you build a basic scooter that will roll in a (relatively) straight line? Another with the suspension of a Batman-ish Tumbler that can clamber over a bed of cubes, cylinders and pyramids? How about a series of rollers with 360-degree rotating legs that can climb, caterpillar-like, up a bunch of steps? Bundled with Vive Feeling more artistic? More a pointillist or taffy-puller? How about a calligraphist of the unknown? Tilt Brush lets you turn the air around you into a painterly montage of gorgeous chromatic light. And it’s not just a 3D brush with bottomless reservoirs of paint. Flick a selection tool and you can add twinkling stars, smoke, swirls of blinking neon — or frame your creation against a cosmic backdrop. The Vive’s touch controls enable much more than casual doodling, letting serious artists unpack whatever’s kicking around their imaginations. Bundled with Vive HTC partner Valve takes a swing at virtual reality with a bunch of Portal-flavored demos. Visit the top of a mountain by way of vertigo-inducing vantage points in what amounts to a VR-movement tutorial, teleporting around (including over to a stomach-dropping precipice) by simply pointing a wand and clicking. Slingshot spheroid robots (styled after Wheatley from Portal 2) at piles of boxes in a warehouse in an obvious nod to Angry Birds. Pull the vibrating string of a bow to fire arrows at spear-waving munchkins trying to storm a tiny castle, the tracking precise enough to distinguish between shooting protective helmets off heads versus body shots. It’s breezy proof-of-concept stuff, but an obvious go-to showcase, say a friend drops by and you want to show them what the whole VR thing’s about. Free download (via Steam) Cloudhead Games’ The Gallery: Call of the Starseed exemplifies why virtual reality’s breaking wave of whatchamacallit experiences work best when moving you gradually through otherworldly venues in lieu of barf-o-rama spectacle. Call of the Starseed kicks off an episodic story inspired by 1980s dark fantasy films and old-school graphical adventure games, sending you after a missing sibling and through a gauntlet of environmental puzzles. But it’s just as much about the thrill of using two hands to perform intuitive actions, like holding a flickering candle up in near darkness to tease the mysteries from a hand-scrawled note. $29.99 Write to Matt Peckham at matt.peckham@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.17500000000000004, "subjectivity_score": 0.5120535714285714},

I could only hope I would land safely on the other side. Hope because, anywhere else, such a jump would surely result in a fatality. But in the lush, quirky universe of Windlands the breeze that continuously rolls across the game’s colorful landscape pushed me along unharmed. Some 20 minutes later, I found myself in another perplexing situation: stranded in outer space, weightless and running out of oxygen. Not long after, I was guiding an amiable fox on a quest for gold coins. I experienced all of this after donning the Oculus Rift, the much-written about, much-anticipated virtual reality headset that began shipping to customers March 28. The Rift, which started as a Kickstarter campaign more than three years ago, has been one of the tech industry’s most eagerly anticipated product launches. (In 2014, Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion, citing virtual reality’s potential to change various aspects of daily life.) The Rift, along with forthcoming headsets from HTC and Sony, promises to bring virtual reality (VR) into the mainstream. Now, consumers who have $600—and a capable PC—can finally buy one and experience it for themselves. Over the course of a week using the Rift, I found that experience beguiling and thrilling at times, uncomfortable and awkward at others. Overall, entering the Rift is expensive, unnatural, and utterly addicting. Virtual reality is often talked about as a revolution, a paradigm shift, a really, really big deal. Using Oculus Rift proves this kind of talk isn’t hype.  Before diving into virtual reality’s imaginary worlds, you’ll have to become familiar with the hardware—and a lot of it. When you order a Rift, Oculus sends the headset, a camera sensor, an Oculus Remote, an Xbox One controller, and plenty of cables to connect it all. Everything comes neatly packaged in a nice box with a premium feel. Because Oculus software requires a significant amount of processing power to generate virtual experiences that are immersive and lag-free, you’ll also need a beefy PC. Alienware, Asus, and Dell sell Oculus-ready computers that meet the Rift’s specifications. For our review, Oculus sent an Asus ROG G20 PC with an NVIDIA graphics card, a very capable gaming machine that runs about $1,000. MORE: These Are the 5 Best Oculus Rift Launch Games Setup is simple thanks to a well-made tutorial that takes you through plugging every thing in and making sure the hardware is correctly configured. Opening a box with this much stuff could be overwhelming to some; luckily Oculus seems to have taken this into account and made the process painless. Software for the Rift is downloaded from Oculus’ proprietary store, which can be used on your desktop or within the headset. On your PC, the store is clean and straightforward; in the headset, you’re transported to a slick virtual home that provides all the same functionality. There is nothing subtle about the Rift, physically or virtually. Between the hulking machine we needed to power it and the jumble of wires required to keep the system connected, our setup occupied most of a conference room table. When wearing the Rift, it’s very obvious to everybody else that you’re mentally (and fashionably) in a different place. The bewildered expressions and occasional barks of joy of my colleagues and I as we tried the Rift attracted inquisitive stares and frequent questions throughout the office. By nature, a device like the Rift forces us out of our comfort zone. (Not literally, the headset itself is quite light and comfortable enough to wear for long stretches of time.) The headset—which is compact but significantly larger than a pair of glasses—is unlike anything you’ll have worn regularly. This can take some getting used to.  By nature, a device like the Rift forces us out of our comfort zone.  Even basic tasks like adjusting the eyewear to fit comfortably and toggling the focus feels a bit unnatural at first, despite the fact that Oculus has made both of these things very simple to do. The straps along the top and the side of the helmet are held together with velcro, making it easy to adjust for a comfortable fit. But, put bluntly, this is not a product you’re going to fully understand until you spend some time with it. Once you do, any apprehension quickly trails off. When you’re inside the Rift, looking around feels about as natural as it does in reality. There’s no latency between where your head moves and the images that appear before you. It feels fluid, vivid, and ultra realistic. Experiences and games for the Rift achieve this effect in different ways. Some just expand the sense of atmosphere so that it completely envelops you, allowing you to play games or view content from a perspective you’ve never been able to before. Other Rift adventures trick your body into believing it’s actually moving—falling off a cliff, soaring through the sky, or zooming down a racetrack. Windlands does the latter exceptionally well. Drifting around the scenery, swinging from trees, and occasionally plummeting after missing my target brought about a pit in my stomach that I usually only experience on theme park rides. I became so engrossed that my body was facing a completely different direction when I took the headset off, and I hadn’t even noticed. The racing game Radical G evokes a similar sensation: you can literally feel the change in speed when your vehicle hits a boost or falls off its track. MORE: Everything You Need to Know About the Oculus Rift But not every Oculus experience invokes this type of bodily response. In fact, many don’t on purpose. Farlands, for example, doesn’t impress with daredevil stomach-twisting stunts. Rather, it rewards player with otherworldly terrain that is just as breathtaking as it is dynamic. Satisfaction in Farlands comes from exploration and befriending new creatures, which approach you timidly and curiously. The Rift isn’t just for games, either. The most enchanting moment I experienced was during a free short film called The Rose and I. As the viewer, you’re teleported to a whimsical solar system where you watch the protagonist befriend the only other living being on its planet: a rose. Like its source material The Little Prince, it’s a touching story about companionship that unfolds so intimately it feels like you could reach out and touch the tiny planet where it takes place. The narrative unfolds in front of a gorgeous starlit backdrop that’s just as entertaining to experience as the story itself. Lost, another short, is equally immersive. The Rift is brand new, but it already offers a wide-ranging library of experiences: games of different genres, short films, virtual tours, videos and photographs. One category that will take longer to develop, however, is social apps. After buying Oculus, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the potential he sees for virtual reality: “By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures.” That vision is likely very far off if it ever comes to fruition. Today, virtual reality is still an isolating experience. While I’m blasting off in a jet pack or exploring Machu Picchu, my coworkers (or your family) would be hard-pressed to know what wonders I am feeling. Because you have to experience virtual reality yourself, it’s difficult to share the excitement in a group. Virtual reality is sure to evoke many different emotions. Loneliness is one of them.  Virtual reality is sure to evoke many different emotions. Loneliness is one of them.  Developers are already finding ways to make VR games more social. Puzzle game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is one sterling example, since it requires the person wearing the headset to interact with others in order to defuse a bomb. To deactivate the explosive, you must correctly complete a series of tasks, such as snipping the right wire or tapping a button at the right time. But each of these tasks is a puzzle, and your companions outside of the Rift are the only ones with instructions to solve it. While many other Rift experiences were visually dazzling, this game was probably the most addictive. MORE: Why Virtual Reality Is About to Change the World There are some notable limitations with the Rift. It is designed primarily as a sitting or standing experience. You won’t be walking very far from your PC wearing your Rift. Another aspect I found pulling me out of my virtual experiences was interacting with virtual people, places, and things. On many occasions, thanks to a convincing sense of immersion, I wanted to reach out and touch. But in my hands I had a familiar video game controller. Oculus and its competitors are already working to this aspect of VR. Oculus’ Touch controllers, which will be available later in 2016, are designed to make interaction with the virtual world more natural by simulating the feeling of having a pair of hands. Gesture recognition company Leap Motion is working on technology that would enable this type of experience without having to hold any physical controller at all. HTC and Sony will offer similar devices when their respective VR headsets launch. So is it worth it? It’s easily worth it if you already have a powerful computer and play a lot of video games. It’s not much more than investing in a gaming console. If you’re merely curious about VR, I suggest taking a look at Samsung’s less expensive Gear VR, which uses Oculus’ software and offers some of the same content. I doubt anybody who invests in buying a Rift will be disappointed with the experiences it makes possible, but the price to enter is steep. What makes the Rift so compelling is that it truly creates the illusion of escape. I now understand why it’s called the Rift in the first place: it creates a colossal disconnect between what’s happening in front of your eyes and what’s actually occurring in the world around you. It literally generates a rift between where you are and where you think you are, what you’re feeling and what your body thinks you’re feeling. It’s brilliant. It’s fascinating. It’s not perfect, but it’s only getting started.

Now the search giant seems like it’s ready for round two. For years, Google has released smartphones under its Nexus brand. But the Pixel phone signaled an important change in strategy, one that positions the search giant as a purveyor of premium smartphones that can rival those made by Apple and Samsung. Whereas Google’s Nexus phones were largely made by hardware partners such as HTC and LG, the Pixel is the first smartphone Google designed in-house. The company unveiled the Pixel last October, and speculation is beginning to circulate about what its successor, perhaps to be called the Pixel 2, will look like. Here’s a look at the Google Pixel 2 smartphone rumors that have surfaced so far. Google could be the next smartphone maker to follow a recent trend popularized by Samsung and LG. The next larger-sized version of the phone, perhaps called the Pixel XL 2, may include a redesigned body with thinner borders around the display, according to a leak published by Android Police. Such a change could make it possible for Google to extend the size of the Pixel XL’s screen without making the device larger, as Samsung and LG have done with their latest phones. The report says the new Pixel XL will have a 6-inch screen instead of the current model’s 5.5-inch display. The smaller version of the Pixel 2, which may feature a 4.97-inch screen, is said to come with a change that’s bound to irk some users. Google may ditch the headphone jack in favor of stereo speakers, according to a report from XDA Developers. Both reports suggest the Pixel 2’s design won’t change much otherwise, as it will likely include the same glass and metal finish as the original Pixel. The Pixel 2 will likely have a better camera, but don’t expect the technical specifications to change all that much. Rather than increasing the number of megapixels, Google may add extra features, according to 9to5Google. That could include new capabilities that allow for better low-light photography. Both versions of the Pixel 2 will reportedly be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset, according to XDA Developers. That’s the same processor found in the OnePlus 5, soon-to-be-released Essential phone, and certain models of the Samsung Galaxy S8. Shoppers can also expect to see 4GB of memory on both phones, says the report. When it comes to storage, XDA says the larger Pixel 2 model could offer 128GB of room while the smaller may have 64GB. It’s unclear if those will be the only choices or if other configurations will be available. Just about every major modern smartphone is built to withstand moderate water exposure, including the iPhone 7, Galaxy S8, and LG G6. Google’s Pixel has been an outlier in that regard, but this may change with the Pixel 2, reports 9to5Google. Google’s Pixel 2 might cost $50 more than the current versions, according to 9to5Google. The company charges $649 for the Pixel and $769 for the Pixel XL, meaning the Pixel 2 could start at $700. But a cheaper version may be imminent; the same report says Google has been testing prototypes of budget-friendly Pixel models with less powerful hardware. If that holds up to be true, it’s unclear if this version will launch in the United States, since the blog’s source mentions the phone is “aimed at different markets.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4533705/google-pixel-review-release-date-2016/", "http://time.com/4517121/google-pixel-phone-2016-specs/", "http://time.com/4797856/essential-phone-release-andy-rubin/"], "sentiment_score": 0.10494264069264067, "subjectivity_score": 0.4868484848484848},
{"type": "article", "header": "Review: LG’s New G6 Android Phone Is a Big Step Up From Last Year", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "April 12, 2017 10:43 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4735303/lg-g6-review/", "text": "The good: Sharp screen; Compact design; Wide front facing camera; Good battery life The bad: Easily picks up fingerprint smudges, Power button and fingerprint sensor placement can feel awkward; Lacks other new features that differentiate it from other new smartphones Who should buy: Android loyalists who want more screen space in a smaller device will be happy with the G6. But it may be worth waiting to check out the Samsung Galaxy S8. With Samsung on the proverbial ropes following its Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, rival Android smartphone makers like HTC and LG had a rare opportunity to leapfrog the perennial market leader. The former’s effort, the HTC U Ultra, largely failed in that regard. Now it’s LG’s turn to try. LG’s new G6 Android phone is radically different from last year’s G5, which was designed around a customizable “modular” concept that never caught on with consumers. This time, LG is pinning its hopes on a design that dramatically reduces the “bezels” alongside the edge of the display, allowing for a bigger screen without increasing the size of the phone itself. But is the G6 enough to go toe-to-toe with Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8, which features a similar design? Here’s what it’s like to use the LG G6, which costs between $650 and $720 depending on your wireless carrier and plan. By far the standout feature on the LG G6 is the sharp and all-consuming screen. Colors and text looked crisp whether I was scrolling through Facebook, watching Netflix, or reading news articles. The quality looked similar to that of Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus and Google’s Pixel XL. But thanks to its nearly bezel-free design — the latest trend among handset makers — the G6 has a slightly taller screen in a similarly-sized body. (LG put a 5.7-inch screen on a 5.86 by 2.83-inch phone, while the Google Pixel XL measures 6.09 by 2.98 inches and has a 5.5-inch screen. The iPhone 7 Plus similarly has a 5.5-inch display with dimensions of 6.23 by 3.07 inches). That means users get the benefit of a bigger display while the phone stays pocketable and one-handable. LG has designed some of its apps to take advantage of the G6’s extra screen space. Square Camera, for instance, uses half the display to show you a preview of an image after it’s captured. And like older LG phones, the G6 can run multiple apps on screen simultaneously. Unfortunately, there’s little else that makes the longer screen more useful beyond watching video and the like. Smartphone shutterbugs won’t find much to fawn over with the G6. The phone’s 13-megapixel cameras (one wide angle, one standard) will get the job done, but the results aren’t breathtakingly impressive. During a side-by-side test with the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL, the G6 produced colors that were just as vibrant as its competitors, but the autofocus wasn’t as capable. But frequent selfie-takers might be happy to know that the G6’s front-facing camera captured more background than the other devices. Some reviewers have knocked LG for putting an older Qualcomm processor in the G6, which could be a handicap against rival devices with the latest-and-greatest hardware. But in practice, the G6 felt plenty fast when opening apps, launching the camera, processing photo edits and so on. Although the G6 is different from last year’s LG G5 in nearly every way, there’s at least one characteristic they share: a rear-mounted power button and fingerprint sensor. LG has been placing the power button on the back of its phones for years, but it still feels awkward if you’re not used to it. The back of the G6 is also covered in glass rather than metal this time, giving it a classier look but making it prone to fingerprint smudges. Like Google’s Pixel phones and HTC’s U Ultra, the G6 also ships with Google Assistant, the search giant’s new digital aide. The Assistant is designed to get to know your habits and behaviors over time, but I found it to be more capable than Apple’s Siri software right out of the box. When I asked the Assistant how to make red sangria, then followed up with “how about white?,” it pulled up the right recipes. After asking Siri the same question, it thought I wanted info about a friend with the last name White. Bigger phones typically mean better battery life, and indeed, I was able to get through a full day with the G6 without having to plug it in — but barely. Rival phones, like the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus, can comfortably last for nearly a day and a half. That said, the G6 has fast-charging tech that lets the battery jump from 10% to 50% in about a half-hour, making overall battery life less of an issue. All told, LG’s G6 is an improvement over the G5 and a solid choice for Android fans who want a bigger screen without a phone that’s physically larger. But display aside, there’s little that differentiates it from rival Android flagships out there. Android users in need of an upgrade, then, may want to wait just a little bit longer until Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is available before pulling the trigger. 3.5 out of 5 stars Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4715110/samsung-galaxy-s8-release-date-price-specs-2017/", "http://time.com/4531372/samsung-note-7-recall-fires-overheating-why/", "http://time.com/4717119/htc-u-ultra-review/", "http://time.com/4715110/samsung-galaxy-s8-release-date-price-specs-2017/", "http://time.com/4487993/apple-iphone-7-review/", "http://time.com/4533705/google-pixel-review-release-date-2016/"], "sentiment_score": 0.08007481648785997, "subjectivity_score": 0.41650844626388095},

Rubin hopes to differentiate the $699 smartphone from its many competitors with features like a magnetic port for accessories and a titanium design. The company has not yet announced when the new phone will begin shipping. One of the Essential phone’s standout features is a magnetic wireless data transfer feature meant to keep accessories from being made obsolete by new connection standards. The concept is similar to Motorola’s “Moto Mods,” custom accessories that attach to certain Motorola phones through a magnetic connector. Essential’s first add-ons include a 360-degree camera and a charging dock. “For all the good Android has done to help bring technology to nearly everyone it has also helped create this weird new world where people are forced to fight with the very technology that was supposed to simplify their lives,” Rubin wrote in a blog post outlining Essential’s goals in developing new gadgets. Essential’s smartphone will also include a USB Type-C port (like most new Android phones) and is powered by a 3,040 mAh battery. That’s larger than those included in the Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel, but slightly smaller than the Galaxy S8+ and Pixel XL’s batteries. Essential is claiming that the phone’s titanium body won’t scratch, dent, or bend. It’s so confident of this, in fact, that it’s not even selling cases for the device. And like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6, Essential’s phone includes an edge-to-edge screen with nearly invisible bezels, aiming to offer a more spacious display while keeping the device comfortable to hold. The borders around the screen are so thin that it looks like a portion of the display wraps around the front facing camera. The phone’s camera system uses two sensors, one color and one monochrome, resulting in photos with up to 200% more color than the average smartphone camera, says Essential. If the Essential’s offering is just as durable and easily customizable as the company claims, it could give manufacturers like Motorola and Samsung some tough competition. But it will have to fully deliver on those promises to stand out in a market that’s already largely dominated by giants like Samsung and Huawei, which together account for 30% of smartphone shipments worldwide, according to research firm IDC.

The idea might sound far-fetched, but consider this: What if you could just replace your phone’s camera instead of paying hundreds to upgrade to an entirely new device?

Read More: Project Ara: Inside Google’s bold gambit to make modular smartphones  Google is opening up the Ara platform to outside developers and companies, meaning your phone could turn into a digital Swiss Army knife of sorts, as CNET explains. A diabetic could add a glucose sensor to his or her phone. An automaker could give you a module that works as a key for your new car. There is precedent here: Smartphone maker LG has already taken steps towards embracing a modular smartphone concept; owners of the LG G5 can swap out the bottom of the device and add a camera grip. (The phone, however, is getting mixed reviews.) There’s no guarantee the Project Ara concept will catch on. While diehard technology hobbyists take pleasure in their ability to customize equipment like desktop computers, most consumers are used to relatively few customization options (and therefore a simpler buying process) when it comes to their gadgets. Other companies have tried and failed to pull off the “modular phone” concept. But if Ara is a hit, it could change the way we buy our smartphones. Tech companies will have to rethink the way they manufacture and market their devices. Instead of advertising minor upgrades about once a year, they will need to put more emphasis on new core components that we can’t change. The value of a phone could be determined by the number of possible customization options, rather than aspects like its camera or design. That future looks more like the world of Windows PCs, which can be built with any number of mixed-and-matched components. But that’s a very large if. It’s unclear whether the average buyer is interested in this type of device. Every fall, shoppers line up outside Apple stores to snag the latest iPhone — which also happens to be the least customizable smartphone you can buy. For any given iPhone iteration, your can choose between two physical sizes, three storage sizes, and a small handful of color options. While some Android phones allow owners to swap out the battery or add extra storage space, Apple doesn’t enable any such tweaks. Consumers might embrace a new cornucopia of smartphone component options — or they might balk at an overly confusing list of possibilities. How they react to the concept will have a major influence on the phones of the future.

LG’s new handset, the G5, is equipped with two rear-facing cameras, one with a traditional lens and another with a wide-angle, 135-degree version. The South Korean firm says the latter lens is wider than that on any other smartphone, allowing users to capture more subject matter in a single photo. Other phone makers have released devices with multiple camera lenses in the past, like HTC. But unlike that firm’s efforts, which focused on creating images with 3D-like effects, LG’s goal is simply to add to users’ photographic options. LG has yet to confirm a price for the new phone, but it will be available in April. Another goal with the G5: Making it easier for users to more quickly see important information. The phone can show tidbits like the time, data and battery status without being fully woken up, thanks to its always-on display. It’s a similar concept to Motorola’s “Active Display,” which wakes up that company’s Moto X handset when it’s picked up. LG says the G5’s always-on functionality won’t be a significant drain on the phone’s battery life because the device’s backlight will only be illuminating a small portion of the screen. Longtime LG fans will notice the G5 is a drastic departure from the company’s previous Android handsets. The G5 features a brushed aluminum body and will be available in pink, gold, silver and “titan.” The G4, by comparison, came in “ceramic” plastic and leather variants, which felt cheaper and less premium than metal. The new model is also noticeably smaller, sporting a 5.3-inch screen versus the G4’s 5.5-inch display. All of these changes make the G5 easier to use and more enjoyable than the G4. Many Android die-hards will be happy to know that, despite its metal build, the LG G5’s battery can still be swapped out by users. That’s largely unheard of with metal phones, as their back panels typically can’t be popped off like a rear casing on a plastic handset. LG made this possible thanks to a bottom that slides off, which also allows users to attach accessories like a camera grip. One downside to the LG G5: Its power button and fingerprint scanner are still located on the back of the device. This unusual placement doesn’t save time when unlocking the device, and makes the phone awkward to use. Overall, the LG G5 seems like a promising choice for Android fans looking for a lightweight, good-looking phone that offers some level of customization. LG has steadily improved the phones in its G-series over the past few years, and the G5 seems to be better suited to take on the competition from Samsung and Apple than any of the company’s previous offerings.

Frankly, the Galaxy S7 is the best phone the South Korean electronics firm has ever made. There are two versions of Samsung’s latest flagship smartphone to choose from: The 5.1-inch Galaxy S7, and the 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 Edge. The latter of which has a screen that’s slightly curved on either side. Both devices are an evolution — a perfection, one might say — of what Samsung set out to do with its previous effort, the Galaxy S6. The new models have small, but important, differences from their predecessors. Users can add extra storage, the return of a feature Android diehards are sure to celebrate. The camera doesn’t jut out awkwardly from the back of the device. And both phones are water resistant, meaning the occasional spill won’t spell certain doom. Taken together, these elements — combined with improvements like a better camera and speedier processor — make the Samsung Galaxy S7 one of the best phones you can buy today. It’s priced at just under $700 without a carrier subsidy, while the Edge model runs about $100 more. Exact costs vary with different carriers. Here’s what it’s like to use both phones, which officially launch on March 11. How they look and feel Technology fans have long criticized Samsung’s smartphone design choices, from the plastic-cased Galaxy S4 to the Band-Aid-like dimpled back panel on the Galaxy S5. But tech pundits started singing a new tune with last year’s arrival of the Galaxy S6, the design of which represented a radical rethink on Samsung’s part. Most of the S6’s celebrated design language, like glossy glass and smooth metal, has made its way to the S7, albeit with tweaks. The standard Galaxy S7’s back is slightly curved, making it more comfortable to hold. The camera on both phones is now flush with the back of the device. The Galaxy S7 Edge stands out in particular for having a screen size matching that of Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, despite having a smaller overall device size. Both S7 phones have a nicer, more elegant look than most Android devices I’ve used. But they don’t stay in mint condition for long, as they’re definitely fingerprint magnets. After about a day’s worth of use, the front and back of my S7 were just as smudged as its screen. This can be avoided by using a case, but it’s worth noting for those who prefer not to cover their phones. The hardware design also means you can’t swap out the Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge’s battery like you can with other Android devices, such as the LG G5 and Samsung’s older phones. The Galaxy S7’s screen is gorgeous and sharp, just like Samsung’s previous high-end smartphones. Both devices feature a Super AMOLED screen with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. Colors pop more boldly here than on the iPhone 6s Plus’ LED 1920 x 1080 screen. Samsung’s new Galaxy S7 devices can also show helpful data like the time, date, and battery status even while the screen is turned off. This feature turned out to be surprisingly useful. Glancing over at my phone instead of reaching for it to check the time was especially convenient. Using them The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have high-quality cameras that capture great images in a wide range of scenarios. The camera’s pixels are slightly larger than those of last year’s model, which in practice means it’s better in low-light conditions. The phones’ autofocus speed has gotten a boost thanks to a technique that uses nearly all of the camera’s pixels to focus, rather than just a portion of them. During my tests, the Galaxy S7 captured photos that were bold, sharp, and colorful, as did Apple’s iPhone 6s Plus. When comparing the same image taken with either phone side-by-side, I found that the sky seemed bluer and more vibrant in the photo taken with Apple’s device. Samsung’s phone captured an excellent shot, but the shade of blue seemed a bit washed out. See both photos below. Samsung Galaxy S7 iPhone 6s Plus The Galaxy S7 excels over the iPhone when shooting photos in dark indoor areas. In a photo taken inside a poorly-lit bar, I noticed my subject was clearer and more visible. Samsung Galaxy S7 iPhone 6s Plus The Galaxy S7 can easily last through an entire work day on a single charge, even when the screen’s Always On feature is activated. The phones survived for a little over a day and a half after I used them moderately throughout the day to do things like stream Netflix, browse the web, and check my email. As with other phones, battery life will vary depending on how the S7 is used. One of the best parts of using an Android device compared to an Apple iPhone is the level of customization they afford. Users can personalize the phone’s theme and add widgets, or interactive icons, to their home screen. But that flexibility comes with an unintended consequence: Clutter. Carriers and phone manufacturers add their own apps and services to the Android gadgets they sell, meaning a phone’s interface can quickly get messy. The Verizon version of the Galaxy S7 I tested came with a folder dedicated to Verizon’s apps, another folder for Samsung’s apps, and a widget advertising Samsung’s apps on one of its home screens. Then there’s also a folder dedicated to apps made by Google, which is standard for most Android devices. I much prefer the simpler, stripped-down interface of Google’s Nexus devices and the iPhone. That being said, not all manufacturer additions are bothersome. Samsung’s modified version of Android includes some useful features, like the ability to launch the camera by double tapping the home button. One of Samsung’s newest additions is the Edge sidebar, which is a software column that users can access by swiping out from the Galaxy S7 Edge’s curved portion of the screen. Here, users can flip through various sidebars, such as a feed of news headlines, apps, favorite contacts, shortcuts to specific tasks (like sending an email to your boss) and more. Third parties can develop Edges (Yahoo News already has one), so we’re likely to see more choices in the future. I occasionally used the Edge sidebar to launch an app quickly or check the news, but I wouldn’t consider it a necessity. Samsung says that both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge can be submerged in five feet of water for up to 30 minutes and live to tell the tale. In testing this, I found that both phones functioned normally after I held them under a running water faucet. I was even able to use the touchscreen while the water poured over the phone, although the fingerprint sensor didn’t work while wet. Final thoughts Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge are attractive, well-built Android phones that offer great battery life and an excellent camera. Those looking to splurge on a high-end Android device should consider the Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge. But there are still a few drawbacks to consider. The glossy design gathers fingerprint smudges easily, which means you’ll have to use a case or clean it often. And Samsung’s software is still cluttered compared to that of Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Nexus phones.

Like new new? Like doesn’t have a version number new?” The line, from Google’s ad introducing its new Pixel smartphone, is a clear dig at Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which some critics derided as just a modest update. By contrast, Google’s new flagship smartphone has been redesigned and rebranded. The Pixel represents a strategy shift for the search giant, which is known more for its advancements in software, algorithms, and online advertising rather than hardware. With the Pixel, Google is looking to change that perception. Google has been releasing Android smartphones under the Nexus label for years. But those phones were largely designed by hardware partners, like HTC and LG, whereas the Pixel feels like the first true Google phone. It’s also the company’s first handset that can truly rival industry leaders Apple and Samsung. That’s because the Pixel has gotten big upgrades in all the important areas, adding a fresh design, a much improved camera, and a smarter virtual assistant. The Pixel, available in 5- and 5.5-inch versions, starts shipping on Oct. 20. Verizon is Google’s exclusive carrier parter for the Pixel, but the phone will be available unlocked through Google’s own online store as well. The standard model starts at $649.99, while the bigger Pixel XL begins at $769.99. Here’s a closer look at what it’s like to use Google’s Pixel phone. How it looks and feels The Pixel is Google’s most attractive phone to date. Its glass and metal build feels much more elegant than that of the Nexus 5X, which had a back panel made of a softer polycarbonate material. The colored trim around the phone’s white front adds a distinguished aesthetic. Flip over the Pixel and you’ll notice another uncommon trait. About three quarters of the rear panel is made of a matte brushed aluminum, while a portion of the top is coated with a glossy glass texture. I’m not sure why Google opted for this layout, but it does address one of the most annoying issues I’ve encountered with other glossy phones, like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Apple’s jet black iPhone 7: because only the top portion of the back surface is made of glass, the Pixel is less prone to gathering fingerprints. The Pixel does share one characteristic with its Nexus 6P predecessor: the placement of its fingerprint scanner. The Pixel’s circular biometric sensor is near the top of the phone’s backside. This is meant to make it easier to unlock the phone while you’re holding the device, since our fingers naturally wrap around the back of our phones as we grip them. While this is true, it also means you can’t unlock the phone with your finger while it’s resting on a table or desk. Instead, you’ll have to pick it up each time you want to gain full access to your device without typing in a passcode. The Pixel lacks a physical home button, instead providing home and navigation keys on screen. Given that, it’s unclear why the bottom bezel of the phone is so thick. Both the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 include home buttons that occupy the bottom portion of the phone’s frontside. Since the Pixel doesn’t share that characteristic, it would have been nice to see Google either extend the screen or shrink the bezel to reduce the phone’s overall size. Apple notably removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but the 3.5mm audio port on Google’s Pixel is alive and well. That might help Google convert some Apple fans who aren’t ready to ditch the jack just yet. But the Pixel’s headphone jack is on top of the phone, which can feel a little awkward if you’re used to a bottom-placed port. One big knock on the Pixel is that it isn’t as water- and dust-resistant as Apple and Samsung’s latest phones. The Pixel can survive being sprayed with water, but not submerged in it. Meeting the Google Assistant Google is playing up its new and improved digital aide, the Google Assistant, as one of the Pixel’s major selling points. While Google Assistant can perform the same tasks as Google Now, it’s more conversational and it can remember context. The Pixel phones, Google Home, and the company’s Allo messaging app are the first products to include Google’s new Assistant. Like many other virtual aides, Google Assistant gets to know you better the more you use it. In the coming months it will also work with third-party apps, likely making it possible to do things like reserve a table or arrange an Uber ride with your voice. Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa also offer such capabilities. It won’t be possible to see the true benefits of the Google Assistant until I’ve had an extensive amount of time to use it. But even after testing it briefly, I’ve found that it’s better at answering general questions than Siri, in most cases. When I asked Google for the best way to cook salmon, for example, it found a recipe from Food Network and read a snippet of it while providing a link to the full story. Siri, meanwhile, just pulled up a list of search results. In some instances, Google Assistant was able to recognize my speech and understand my questions more accurately than Siri. When I asked the Google Assistant where to buy winter boots, it offered a link to Macy’s, while Siri said it couldn’t find a place that matched my query. I then asked Google, “How about winter jackets?” and it offered a link to Burlington Coat Factory based on the context of my last question. I asked Apple’s virtual assistant the same question, and it just pulled up the roster for the Columbus Blue Jackets hockey team. Using the Pixel With the Pixel, Google has added new features and shortcuts without making the interface feel cluttered. One of the most noteworthy new features coming to the Pixel’s software is the introduction of app shortcuts, which is very similar to Apple’s 3D Touch. Pressing down a little longer than usual on certain Google app icons, like Maps or Drive, will pull up a small submenu of quick actions. Long-pressing Maps, for example, will offer the option to quickly jump into directions to a saved location, like your office or home. This only works in a few Google apps for now, but the company says it’s working with third parties to bring it to other apps as well, including LinkedIn, Evernote and Foursquare. My one gripe about this feature is that if you long-press on an app that doesn’t support this feature yet, the Pixel will think you want to move that app icon to a different spot on the home page, which can be annoying. Another handy timesaver lies in the Pixel’s fingerprint scanner, which doubles as a touchpad for scrolling through incoming notifications. When this function is turned on in the settings menu, swiping down on the sensor will pull down your notification tray and quick settings bar. It’s especially useful for users of the larger Pixel XL. One of the best reasons to buy Google’s phones has always been their lack of “bloatware,” or superfluous apps and widgets that smartphone makers and wireless carriers all too often add to Android handsets. Since Google previously sold its phones primarily through its online store rather than partnering with carriers, Nexus devices have always had a clean and straightforward interface without such mess. The situation is slightly different this year, since Google is working with Verizon as its carrier launch partner. The Pixel comes with a couple of Verizon apps, like Messages+ and its go90 content service. Although many Pixel owners may never find themselves opening these apps, the phone’s overall interface remains generally clutter-free. The Pixel’s home screen has also been slightly modified. While some older Nexus phones and other Android devices include a Google Search widget, the Pixel has a more subtle tab with Google’s G logo on the left side of the screen. Tapping this tab expands it into a full search bar that displays your most recent queries. The other corner of the home screen houses a small weather widget that provides the day’s forecast and temperature. These minor changes make the home screen feel cleaner. Swiping over from left to right on the home screen will bring you to the Google Search page, which includes a search bar, information about the week’s weather, news stories related to your interests, and more. This section of the interface hasn’t really changed compared to Google’s previous smartphones, and Apple’s latest update offers a similar feature that pulls up news headlines, suggested apps, the weather, and more. What’s different and unique to Google, however, is the way Google’s interface plugs into your recent search results to surface relevant information. If you’ve recently searched for a specific item (i.e. winter boots, etc.), Google will include a section on this page that provides price updates for that product. In terms of battery life, the Pixel should be more than adequate for getting power users through a full day. Those who use their phones sparingly to occasionally check notifications or browse the Web will get even more mileage out of this device. The larger Pixel XL, which comes with a bigger battery than the 5-inch model, easily lasted a day and a half on a single charge during my testing, putting it pretty much in line with other large phones, like Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. The Camera Google claims the Pixel’s 12.3-megapixel camera is its best yet, with testing site DxoMark rating it as the best camera on a smartphone. Google has good reason to be boastful: the Pixel’s camera is on par with that of its rivals, in some cases even surpassing the new camera on Apple’s iPhone 7. In general, I found that photos taken with Google’s Pixel were more colorful than those taken with the iPhone 7 Plus, although Apple’s phone offered more detail and displayed colors more accurately as they appear in real life. Check out some sample images below. Google Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Google Nexus 6P In dark settings, the Google Pixel’s flash was able to light subjects more evenly. But the iPhone 7 Plus’ dual-lens camera was better at taking photos in low-light with no flash. That being said, the iPhone 7 Plus is unrivaled when it comes to its zooming capabilities. Apple’s larger-sized smartphone offers a 10x zoom that produces photos crisp enough to easily read text from a far distance. The Plus model will also be receiving a new feature in an upcoming software update that sharpens a subject against its background, making it easier to capture high-quality portraits without any editing. Google’s phone doesn’t zoom as well as Apple’s handset, or offer a similar portrait mode. It does, however, combine your burst shots into GIFs, which can be especially helpful when shooting things like sporting events, children, or pets. Conclusion With its long battery life, great camera, attractive design, and intelligent assistant, Google’s new Pixel is the Android phone to beat. The larger Pixel XL in particular is now the best option for those seeking a larger Android smartphone, given Samsung’s decision to halt production of the problem-plagued Galaxy Note 7. What’s most intriguing is thinking about how the Google Assistant will evolve over time. Google is touting its virtual agent as being the next iteration of its search product. If it remains exclusive to Google’s own hardware, it could be a major selling point, especially for those who are already deeply hooked into Google’s products and services. If the Google Assistant gets better at answering complex compound questions, conversing more naturally, integrating with third-party apps, and learning about its user over time, it has an opportunity to truly make smartphones smarter in a meaningful way. It’s a goal Apple and Samsung are also trying to achieve with Siri and the newly acquired Viv, respectively. All told, the Pixel is Google’s first smartphone that can go toe-to-toe with Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy flagship. It’s on equal footing with those phones in most of the areas that really matter, although its lack of water resistance is a setback. Still, Android fans who pick up the Pixel should be pleased, so long as they keep it dry. 4 out of 5 stars Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4487993/apple-iphone-7-review/", "http://time.com/4367278/apple-wwdc-siri-ios-10/", "http://time.com/4520667/samsung-viv-labs-artifical-intelligence/"], "sentiment_score": 0.19000545914262726, "subjectivity_score": 0.4709540729673475},

How tough? Six years after Tim Cook took control of operations at Apple from Jobs, he’s still trying to escape the long shadow of his predecessor. Cook has led Apple since January 2011, when Jobs went on medical leave to battle pancreatic cancer. The following August, Cook formally assumed the title of CEO. Under his leadership, Apple’s market cap has risen 144%, besting the 104% gain in the Nasdaq Composite Index. During the previous six years – the last six of Jobs’ tenure – Apple’s stock rose 329%.  Those numbers underscore the dilemma Cook faces. On the one hand, he’s steered Apple into a success that surpasses that of most of its Silicon Valley peers. On the other, he’s not Steve Jobs. And that has left Cook in a position where, no matter how well Apple is doing, it never quite seems to be good enough. In the last year alone, Apple’s stock has risen more than 25% – again outperforming the Nasdaq by a good margin. And yet in recent weeks, many observers have been questioning Cook’s leadership, prompted in good part by the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone’s now legendary introduction by Jobs. Some observers feel Apple has been losing its focus. One entrepreneur compared Cook to Steve Ballmer, who while CEO of Microsoft missed opportunities in search and mobile. A Wall Street analyst complained that Apple “lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation.” A former Apple employee tweeted, “The very first thing Tim did as CEO was convert Apple from a dynamic change-maker into a boring operations company.”  Read more: Everything we think we know about the next iPhone Of course, Cook has his defenders. But 2016 presented Apple with its share of challenges. In its fiscal year through September, Apple saw its revenue decline for the first time in 15 years. Upgrades to the iPad, the Apple Watch and the MacBook Pro were steady improvements enough, but lacked the panache of years past. The company was seen as lagging behind Google and Microsoft in artificial intelligence. Bold new products, long promised by Cook, didn’t arrive soon enough to placate Apple skeptics. All of these developments tugged at a core concern: Apple is losing its innovative edge. It had become The iPhone Company – the device makes up 70% of company revenue – and smartphones are becoming a saturated market. Even if that wasn’t Cook’s fault, it remained a big problem for him. When The New York Times asked Peter Thiel if the age of Apple were over, he said yes. “It’s not the fault of Tim Cook, but it’s not an area where there will be any more innovation.” On Tuesday, Cook had his chance to disagree with all these naysayers. Apple said it returned to year-over-year growth last quarter for the first time in four quarters. Cook was careful to enumerate all the financial records it set last quarter: iPhone revenue. Watch revenue. Mac revenue. Revenue from the App Store and other services. Overall, revenue rose 3% last quarter, while earnings per share rose to $3.36. (Not everything was a record: Net income fell 3% to $17.9 billion). One bright spot was services like the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue there grew by 18% last quarter as the number of paid subscribers grew to 150 million and as the average spend per customer also increased. Cook said he expects services revenue to double to around $50 billion in four years. But the better news concerned Apple’s core iPhone business. Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones last quarter, above the 77 million estimate analysts had been looking for. iPhone revenue was strong in all regions except China, and many sales were coming from both upgrades and people switching from other manufacturers – two important developments as the global market for smartphones grows saturated. That’s crucial for Cook, because it gives him time to prepare for the next iPhone, Apple’s most anticipated release in years. Not only is the next iPhone arriving on the 10th anniversary of the first model, it’s rumored to have features like an OLED screen, a glass casing, a battery that charges wirelessly, and possibly augmented reality features that Cook has hinted at in recent months. If the “iPhone 8,” or whatever it ends up being officially named, revives Apple’s sales the way the iPhone 6 did a few years ago, Cook will have more time to deliver on the longer-term products he keeps insisting are in the pipeline. Unlike many previous earnings calls, no analyst asked for an update on that pipeline. The focus right now is squarely on the next iPhone, the next version of the game-changer Jobs unveiled a decade ago. And for Cook, that’s enough. Unlike skeptics like Thiel, he sees plenty of life left in the smartphone. “I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. I think there’s lots more to do,” Cook said during Apple’s earnings call Tuesday. “We think different about a bunch of things,” he added, invoking an old Apple slogan. “This is just one more thing.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4583362/apple-iphone-8-7s-release-rumors-2016/", "http://time.com/4581365/apple-iphone-tim-cook-stock-earnings/", "http://time.com/4583362/apple-iphone-8-7s-release-rumors-2016/", "http://time.com/4452474/tim-cook-apple-augmented-reality/", "http://time.com/4581365/apple-iphone-tim-cook-stock-earnings/"], "sentiment_score": 0.12256293089626426, "subjectivity_score": 0.40651635401635394},

If you’re after a cheap tablet for basic reading or sharing with the kids, consider Amazon’s HD Fire 8. The $79.99 tablet has your Kindle library built into the operating system, making it possible to jump back into your current read by swiping to the right of the home screen. The Fire HD 8 runs on Amazon’s Fire OS software, which is based on Android, so it offers many popular apps found in Google and Apple’s respective app stores. The 1,280-by-800 pixel resolution screen is notably less sharp than those found on pricier alternatives, though that’s to be expected of a sub-$100 tablet. The Fire HD 8 is available in 16GB and 32GB storage options, but there’s an SD card slot for expanding that up to 256GB. Plus, it comes with Amazon’s voice enabled assistant Alexa, which can be accessed by holding down the home button.

Users can build their own profiles, including one for children with content restrictions, educational goals and time limits. And the tablet’s casing is less fragile than those of premium models like the iPad and Galaxy Tab S3, easing concerns when tossing it in your bag without a case or handing it off to a clumsy family member. Buy now: Amazon Fire HD 8 starting at $79.99 Apple fans that simply want to browse the web, run apps and play games don’t need to spend upwards of $600 on a new iPad. The $329 tablet, introduced in March, is more than capable of handling those tasks. It employs the same A9 processor as the iPhone 6s and has a screen that’s about as sharp as that of the iPad Pro. Although the Pro is more powerful, the standard iPad is still useful for getting work done, especially when iOS 11 launches this fall. While it won’t work with the Apple Pencil or Smart Keyboard, you can pair it with a third-party keyboard like those made by Logitech and Belkin. Here are the other big differences between the iPad and iPad Pro: storage options cap at 128GB instead of 512GB, it has an 8-megapixel camera instead of 12 that doesn’t record in 4K, and there are two speakers instead of four. The screen is also slightly smaller than the 10.5-inch Pro and has a lower refresh rate, which may make scrolling a bit slower. But none of these differences hamper the experience so long as you’re not a professional media editor, and just looking to do things like watch Netflix, check email, or browse the web. Buy now: Apple iPad starting at $329 With an eye-popping screen and a stylus built-in, Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S3 is a worthwhile candidate for Android fans. The tablet will feel familiar to those who’ve used the company’s Galaxy phones in the past, since it shares some of its physical characteristics like a glossy finish. But it’s really the Tab S3’s screen, which utilizes a Super AMOLED panel (unlike Apple’s iPads), that makes everything pop, with much bolder and vibrant colors than are possible on conventional LED screens. What makes the Tab S3 a better value than Microsoft and Apple’s offerings is its inclusion of Samsung’s S Pen stylus. By contrast, Apple charges $99 for the Apple Pencil, while Microsoft’s Surface Pen weighs in at $59.99. The S Pen can do more than the Surface Pen or Apple Pencil, too, including handy features like hovering over a word or phrase to translate text. The software also supports multitasking capabilities that make it possible to view apps in split screen mode and send content between your phone and tablet. Buy now: Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 starting at $599.99 If you’re committed to Apple and looking for a productivity-focused tablet, consider checking out the iPad Pro. The newest model now comes in a smaller 10.5-inch size form, in addition to the significantly larger 12.9-inch variant. Apple high-end tier also includes new screen tech that makes scrolling smoother, a zippier processor and the same 12-megapixel, 4K shooting camera found on the iPhone 7. And of course the Pro models are the only iPads compatible with Apple’s Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil. The iPad Pro is best suited for those who intend to use it primarily for tasks that require hefty processing power, or need more screen real estate and storage space (like professionals who frequently edit photos or design 3D models on the go). For most other tasks, the cheaper standard iPad is more than sufficient. Buy now: 10.5-inch starts at $649, 12.9-inch starts at $799 Those in need of a tablet that’s better at replacing a PC should give Microsoft’s Surface Pro a try. Like many Windows tablets, the Surface runs Windows 10, meaning it’s capable of running full desktop programs. Microsoft’s Surface stands out for its adjustable hinge, slim yet comfortable keyboard (sold separately) and sleek design. The most recent Surface Pro model, which Microsoft released in June, is 20% faster than the Surface Pro 4, and includes a redesigned kickstand that’s more flexible. I also prefer Microsoft’s keyboard cover and Surface Pen to Apple’s accessories: the Apple Pencil does little more than draw and shade, while the Surface Pen’s top button functions as a shortcut for pulling up stylus-optimized apps.

The Surface Pro 4 starts at $649, which is $150 cheaper than the fifth generation’s $799 base price. The older version runs an earlier version of Intel’s Core i-processor, but there’s little else that differentiates the two.

But Windows fans have been dying for the software giant to release a full-blown laptop for years. The Surface Laptop, starting at $999 and launching on Thursday, is that device. Microsoft dipped its toes into the notebook space with 2015’s Surface Book, but it was still a tablet hybrid. The appropriately-named Surface Laptop is the company’s first true laptop. It has a touchscreen, but doesn’t share the same folding, bendable, or detachable characteristics that have come to define modern Windows computers. The Surface Laptop, which Microsoft is pushing as the ideal computer for students, runs new software called Windows 10 S. It’s a paired-down version of Microsoft’s operating system, which Microsoft says helps makes the computer faster, longer-lasting and more secure. But Windows 10 S can only run apps found in Microsoft’s Windows Store, a limiting factor that’s worth considering. Indeed, Windows 10 S turned out to be my least favorite part of the Surface Laptop. The software limitation meant I couldn’t download many of my favorite apps, like Google Chrome, Steam, or Firefox. (You’ll also be stuck with Microsoft’s Edge browser.) Users who want Microsoft software like the Office suite or productivity apps like Adobe Photoshop will be fine, and the device is certainly more capable than Chromebooks, which primarily run web-based apps. But others will want to pay the extra $49 to upgrade to a standard version of Windows 10. (Microsoft will waive that fee for devices like the Surface Laptop priced $799 and up through the end of the year.) Read more: Microsoft Probably Won’t Make a Cheaper Laptop Anytime Soon Hardware is where the Surface Laptop truly shines. The elegant metal build offers Apple-like attention to detail, most evident in the way users can lift the lid with a single finger even though there’s no groove for the purpose. Even the way the Windows logo is etched into the lid recalls Apple’s notebooks. If style and portability are your main concerns, the Surface Laptop won’t disappoint. The Surface Laptop’s 2,256 by 1,504 resolution screen is also impressive. It made colors look bold and crisp, whether I was editing photos, browsing online photo galleries, or watching videos. The screen is on par with that of Apple’s 12-inch MacBook, while it looked more colorful than the 1,920 by 1,080 display on a Lenovo Yoga 910 I had been using alongside it. The keyboard is bound to be the most divisive design choice on Microsoft’s part here. The deck is coated in a Alcantara material that’s soft to the touch, resulting in a more comfortable resting platform for your wrists. But there’s a downside: if the deck happens to get smudged, it’s harder to wipe away the stain compared to a metal surface. But typing is enjoyable thanks to deeply situated and well-spaced buttons. The touchpad is also smooth and precise, although I found the Yoga 910’s to be a bit more sensitive. Read more: Microsoft’s Windows Chief on the Surface, Virtual Reality, and More Microsoft says the Surface Laptop can last for 14.5 hours on a single charge during video playback. That’s a bold promise. I didn’t find the claim to be true during my testing, but was nonetheless satisfied with the results. After about 7.5 hours of usage, which included a mix of word processing, web browsing, light gaming and photo editing, the notebook went into sleep mode with roughly 5% of juice left. As a fully-fledged laptop, I was hoping for a better selection of ports than Microsoft provided here. It has one USB 3.0 port, a headphone jack, a mini DisplayPort connector, and the same charging slot as the Surface tablet lineup. But there’s no USB-C port, which could become inconvenient as more accessories begin to support the new standard. It also means you need to keep the Surface Laptop’s proprietary charger handy. And the lack of any SD card slots makes it tougher to transfer photos from a camera. Still, the lack of ports helps keep the Surface Laptop thin and light, and it still beats the array on Apple’s 12-inch MacBook, which has only a single USB-C port and a headphone jack. All said, Microsoft’s first crack at a real laptop is a winner. Between the light and elegant design, sharp screen, and good battery life, the Surface Laptop is a solid choice for shoppers seeking a premium Windows machine. But buyers should be aware of the limitations that come with Windows 10 S. There are also similar Windows 10 laptops to choose from in the same price range, such as the Dell XPS 13 and Lenovo Yoga 910. 4 out of 5 stars.

Samsung said in a statement it plans to integrate the San Jose-based company’s AI platform, called Viv, into the Galaxy smartphones and expand voice-assistant services to home appliances and wearable technology devices. Financial terms were not disclosed. Technology firms are locked in an increasingly heated race to make AI good enough to let consumers interact with their devices more naturally, especially via voice. Alphabet Inc’s Google is widely considered to be the leader in AI, but others including Amazon.com, Apple and Microsoft have also launched their own offerings including voice-powered digital assistants. Samsung, the world’s top smartphone maker, is also hoping to differentiate its devices, from phones to fridges, by incorporating AI. The acquisition of Viv could help the Korean firm shore up its competitiveness at a time when Google’s new Pixel smartphones – armed with the U.S. firm’s voice-powered digital assistant – threatens Samsung and other smartphone makers who are largely reliant on the Android operating platform. “Viv brings in a very unique technology to allow us to have an open system where any third-party service and content providers (can) add their services to our devices’ interfaces,” Rhee In-jong, Samsung’s executive vice president, told Reuters in an interview. The executive said Samsung needs to “really revolutionise” how its devices operate, moving towards using voice rather than simply touch. “We can’t innovate using only in-house technology,” Rhee said. Viv chief executive and co-founder Dag Kittlaus, a Siri co-creator, and other top managers at the firm will continue managing the business independently following the acquisition. Rhee told Reuters Samsung will continue to look for acquisitions to bolster its AI and other software capabilities, without naming any targets.

Now, roughly three years later, we have the clearest picture yet of what a more open Apple looks like. During its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 13, Apple announced a slew of changes to some of its apps and services that allow them to work with third parties. Siri, iMessage, Apple Maps, and the Phone app are among the Apple services that developers will be able to tap into. This means iPhone owners will be able to do things like call an Uber through Siri, order food without leaving the Messages app, and make reservations in Apple Maps. Apple’s decision to let Siri and its messaging app access third party apps is by no means an original one: Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have all made similar improvements recently. And while the announcement may seem out of character given the company’s infamous walled-garden approach, it’s actually in line with the updates Apple has made to its iPhone software in years past. Apple has gradually made it easier to multitask and switch between apps without having to navigate back to the home screen. These newly announced integrations are bound to make that all the more true in iOS 10, since users will be able to transfer money to a friend without leaving their iMessage conversation or call an Uber by asking Siri instead of switching apps. Consider last year’s iOS 9 update. Apple added back buttons to apps so that one could easily jump from Safari to Mail and back to Apple’s browser without the middle step of hitting the home button. Siri in iOS 9 also began to proactively suggest apps that you might want to open, in some cases preventing the need to find a specific app on the home screen. Before iOS 9, Apple laid the foundation for the third-party ties it announced today with an older update. The company’s previous version of the software from 2014 introduced app extensions, which brought elements such as keyboards from other app makers and photo editing tools from outside apps into Apple’s own iOS apps. This, in turn, eliminated the need to open a specific app just to use one or two editing features. Apple’s move is indicative of a larger trend that’s accelerated in recent months, one in which we spend less time inside apps and more time interacting with virtual assistants and messaging agents. Mary Meeker, a partner with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, highlighted this shift in her widely read report on the state of the Internet, noting that home screens are less likely to be our portals to the Internet in the future. Device makers like Apple have an incentive to give developers greater access to their own software. Most products and apps aren’t very useful unless they’re compatible with a wide range of apps and services. Amazon’s Echo is also a sterling example of this: a large part of the reason it’s become a success is because Alexa works with more than 1,000 apps and services. If it only worked with Amazon’s apps, or was only capable of retrieving search queries, it wouldn’t provide the same level of convenience.

Thus concluded the company’s brief, unprofitable foray into smartphone hardware, which began when it revealed plans to acquire Motorola Mobility in August, 2011. Except that it didn’t really end there. It turned out that Google was holding onto one organization within Motorola: the Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group. Headed by Regina Dugan, the former director of the U.S. Defense Department’s fabled Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), ATAP aims to bring the same approach to mobile-gadget innovation that DARPA used to kickstart the Internet, satellite navigation, stealth fighters and other technologies that started small and eventually mattered a lot. In retrospect, it’s completely logical that Google would choose to retain ATAP. The technologies and projects it specializes in are the wildly audacious ideas Google likes to call moonshots. The company already has another group devoted to such efforts — Google X, which is working on Google Glass, self-driving cars, broadband balloons and more — but it’s hard to imagine it handing off any moonshots in progress to Lenovo or anyone else. Among the ATAP initiatives that have been announced, one in particular is quintessentially Google-y. It’s Project Ara, which aims to reinvent the smartphone by breaking it down into modules that can be assembled and customized in a limitless number of configurations. The company first disclosed that the project existed on October 29 of last year, when it released some intriguing photos but little in the way of concrete details. Today, it’s lifting the veil further as it prepares for an Ara developer conference it’s holding at Silicon Valley’s Computer History Museum on April 15-16. A year or so from now, it hopes to have a product on the market. Google ATAP The back side of a modular Ara phone Right now, if you buy a smartphone, the odds are that you’ll get something that one of a handful of large companies designed to appeal to tens of millions of people. And as gobsmackingly capable as modern phones are, that dynamic leads to a certain sameness. Even Motorola’s much-ballyhooed program that lets consumers order custom Moto X phones assembled at a Texas plant involves superficial factors such as case colors and materials, not unique features. By allowing for features to be implemented as user-installable modules, Project Ara’s creators hope to make smartphones a whole lot more interesting. “The question was basically, could we do for hardware what Android and other platforms have done for software?” says Paul Eremenko, the DARPA alumnus who leads the effort. “Which means lower the barrier to entry to such a degree that you could have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of developers as opposed to just five or six big [manufacturers] that could participate in the hardware space.” It’s a big, improbable dream; even based on what little information Google has disclosed to date, pundits have been busy pointing out the pitfalls. But if Ara works as advertised and large numbers of phone buyers buy into the proposition, they could get something that contrasts sharply with the traditional breed of off-the-shelf phones released on a yearly schedule. For instance, when Samsung announced the Galaxy S5 this week, its headline improvements included a better camera, a fingerprint scanner and a heart-rate monitor. In a world of modular phones, you might be able to pick any or all of those features and add them to the phone you already have. You’d even be able to pick among multiple cameras, or choose quirky features not meant for the masses. (Eremenko’s playful example: an on-phone incense burner.) Ara also speaks to an overarching issue near to Google’s heart: the need to help get another five billion people on the Internet, by bringing it to individuals in developing nations in affordable forms tailored to their needs. The first expression of the modular concept Ara’s creators are focusing on is a smartphone with a target price of $50 that’s so basic it comes with only Wi-Fi, not a cellular connection. Unlike the bargain-basement “feature phones” such a handset would replace, this wouldn’t be a technological anachronism. As its owner’s needs evolved and budget permitted, new modules would make it better and better and better. Wikipedia Cameras for use with Handspring’s Springboard slot The notion that a pocket-sized device might provide modular expansion for capabilities designed by third parties is hardly new. Fifteen years ago, the Handspring Visor — a PDA created by the inventors of the PalmPilot — made a splash with a feature called Springboard. A slot on the device’s backside accommodated modules that expanded the phone’s capabilities, even turning it into a proto-smartphone with an add-on called the VisorPhone. The Springboard slot generated lots of excitement for a time, but it made for a portly PDA in an era when rivals were emphasizing slim design And “most modules were single purpose — there was a camera, memory, a modem, GPS, the phone,” remembers Handspring product manager Greg Shirai. “Some people liked to carry a bandolier of modules and swap them in and out. It was geeky and fun. But at some point, a lot of people didn’t.” When Handspring turned its efforts to the Treo smartphone, says Shirai, “we decided we had our hands full just trying to build a great phone.” And the Springboard slot was relegated to the dustbin of gadget history. Modu The Modu T phone and some of its special-purpose jackets The modularity concept resurfaced in 2008 with phones from Modu, an Israeli startup that made a credit card-sized micro-handset you could slip into different cases for different purposes — one sported a five-megapixel camera, another a BlackBerry-esque keyboard. But the idea didn’t catch on, and Modu folded. (It ended up selling its patents to — wait for it — Google, suggesting that someone at the company was intrigued by modular phones at least as early as 2011.) Meanwhile, the most influential smartphone of all time, Apple’s iPhone, was leading the entire industry in a distinctly non-modular direction: Even the battery was sealed into the case, and there was no memory-card slot for storage expansion. So last September, when Dave Hakkens, an industrial-design student from the Netherlands, proposed a snap-together smartphone system he called Phonebloks, the very notion felt as contrarian as it did futuristic. Phonebloks Dave Hakkens’ Phonebloks concept Hakkens was motivated mostly by the ecological implications of a culture that has tech enthusiasts using a smartphone for only a year or two before dumping it and moving onto something newer and shinier. After all, “If you have a bike and you get a flat tire,” he reasoned, “you don’t throw it away and buy a new bike.” His noble, seemingly far-fetched goal was to spark enough interest in Phonebloks that the industry would embrace the concept and make it happen. For starters, he made an engaging video and set out to find 500 supporters on “crowd-speaking” site Thunderclap. Instead, nearly a million signed up, and the video went on to rack up 19 million YouTube views. But even if Phonebloks was an instant phenomenon, it remained a vision of a phone from a possibly distant future, as far as Hakkens knew. “Maybe it’ll take us ten or twenty years, but it’s not impossible,” he remembers thinking. Motorola, startled by the sudden surge of enthusiasm for something so similar to the effort it had been secretly toiling on for months, moved its announcement of Project Ara up by a month. It also partnered with Hakkens, whose Phonebloks site now serves as a community where enthusiasts can brainstorm Ara-related ideas. (Hakkens stresses that he’s an equal-opportunity supporter of modularity: He’s also pleased about the Eco-Mobius, a concept phone with user-replaceable components that Chinese manufacturer ZTE showed off at last month’s CES conference.) Exuberant though the support for Phonebloks was, Hakkens’ campaign also proved that an awful lot of people just didn’t buy the idea of a modular phone. Fast Company’s John Brownlee, for instance, called it “a pipe dream,” while Colin Lecher of Popular Science ventured that it would “fall apart faster than a Lego castle in the path of a toddler.” A whole Reddit thread was devoted to knowledgeable people helpfully explaining why build-it-yourself smartphones were a technological non-starter. Project Ara aims to prove the naysayers wrong, and to do so more quickly than you might think possible. The earliest explorations of the concept started in the fall of 2012, and work got underway in earnest on April 1, 2013. Eremenko says that ATAP is finishing up work on a functioning prototype, which will be ready within weeks, with a version ready for commercial release in the first quarter of 2015. DARPA Project Ara head Paul Eremenko, in a photo taken during his days at the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Google has made so much headway on Ara in so little time because of the lean, speedy approach to invention that Dugan, Eremenko and other DARPA defectors brought with them when they joined Motorola. ATAP is applying it to a variety of projects: Besides Project Ara, efforts underway include Project Tango, an experimental smartphone that can map the world around it. Plus, presumably, other efforts that remain undisclosed. The DARPA/ATAP way involves small in-house teams — just three people in the case of Ara — being given about two years to tackle an ambitious challenge. That schedule is meant to be a little scary: “Generally, time is not your friend,” says Eremenko. “Innovation under time pressure is generally higher-quality innovation.” Much of the heavy lifting is done by “external performers” — individuals, companies or universities that contribute to the project on a contractual basis as necessary, either briefly or for the long haul. In the case of Project Ara, one key external performer is NK Labs, a small outfit sandwiched in between a towing company and a fencing center in an industrial section of Cambridge, Massachusetts. NK’s founders, Seth Newburg and Ara Knaian, are overseeing the electrical, mechanical and software engineering required to make modular phones a reality, heading up a team of around fifteen people. “They’re absolute superstars in their field,” Eremenko says. “Creative, out-of-the-box, do-anything kind of guys. I could never, ever get them to work [for Google] full time, move across the country, et cetera, et cetera. There was no way in the traditional model to capture that mindshare.” (In case you’re wondering: Yes, Project Ara’s moniker is a nod to Ara Knaian, both to acknowledge his contributions and because he happened to have a name that sounded cool. Google hasn’t decided what all this stuff will be called when it becomes a commercial offering.) Google ATAP An experimental 3D-printed antenna Another vital contributor to the effort is 3D Systems, the major maker of 3D-printing equipment. It’s developing a new high-speed continuous 3D printer capable of cranking out enclosures for Ara modules in volume, allowing for phones to be both mass-produced and custom-designed in a way that’s new for any consumer product. Eventually, even electrical elements such as the antennas might be printed rather than manufactured by conventional means. “If this is successful, it could become one of those watershed moments for 3D printing,” says 3D Systems CEO Avi Reichental. “All of us passionately share the vision of what this could become, and the passion to do our best to make it happen.” Though ATAP now falls into the part of Google responsible for Android and Chrome, headed by Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai, it hasn’t exactly been subsumed into the Google machine. After the Motorola sale was announced, the Ara team decamped to a tiny sublet office at an office park with a 1980s vibe, seven miles from Google’s Mountain View, Calif. headquarters. The downside: Staffers don’t get any of that fabulous free food that other Google employees feast on. But they do get to sidestep big-company burdens such as dealing with the mothership’s security apparatus and legal department. What the Ara team and its outside collaborators have created is a platform that supports three sizes of phone: mini (rather basic), medium (mainstream) and jumbo (an oversized, phablet-style variant). The size of each is determined by its endoskeleton, or endo for short — the one component of an Ara phone that will be Google-branded, as opposed to being devised by a third-party company. The endo is an aluminum frame that contains a bit of networking circuitry so the modules can talk to each other, a tiny back-up battery and not much else. Everything from the screen to the processor to the battery is provided in the form of a module — the medium-sized endo has space for ten of them — which you slide into place to form a phone. In the first prototype, the modules use retractable pins to connect to the endo’s network; later this year, Google plans to replace that approach with more space-efficient capacitive connections. Doug Aamoth / TIME A prototype Project Ara module, without its enclosure Like the expansion slots on a desktop PC’s motherboard, each compartment on the endo is designed to handle any module of the correct size, regardless of its function. Though basic technical issues are sometimes a factor — an antenna can’t just go anywhere on a phone’s body, for instance — the general idea is to design the phone so that you can swap modules in and out at will. If you never take photos with your phone but worry about running out of power, for instance, you might choose to do without a camera module, freeing up room for a second battery. Furthermore, the Ara platform is designed to permit hot-swapping of modules, without requiring you to power down the phone — which means that you could slide out the camera and replace it with a battery whenever you needed a little extra juice. Many modules would offer features that every conventional smartphone offers as standard equipment, such as cameras, speakers and various sensors. But Eremenko says that breaking them out into modules will allow a consumer to make a phone more personal, choosing speakers optimized for NPR-type content, for instance, or ones meant for rap. Rather than everything being dependent on a component maker’s skill at landing contracts with big handset manufacturers, phone buyers would call the shots. “If it turns out that consumers really care about megapixels in cameras, then your bajillion-megapixel camera is going to sell,” he says. “And if it turns out that consumers don’t, then it won’t.” Google ATAP Ara Knaian, lead mechanical engineer on Project Ara, with the phone in its current functional prototype form Other modules could offer more specialized capabilities. Based in part on lessons it learned last summer from MAKEwithMOTO — a tour that involved visiting universities and Maker Faires in a Velcro-covered van outfitted with existing Motorola phones modded to encourage hacking — Eremenko thinks that two particularly hot categories will be health and personal transportation. Texas A&M students, for example, rigged up a camera attachment and depth sensor that gives a phone the ability to conduct eye exams. Another team designed an add-on for skateboarders that captured data about terrain, then relayed it to other skaters. In the future, either idea could be an Ara module. Ara handles one common concern about modular phones — what’s to keep them from falling apart in your pocket or when they slip out of your hand? — in two different ways. The modules on the front of the endo are secured with latches. Those on the back use electropermanent magnets. In both cases, you use an app to lock everything in place. Eremenko says that the phone will be as resistant to water and other environmental threats as conventional models, although some tests — including one that simulates the phone being jostled around in a crowded purse — will need to wait until ATAP has a functioning prototype. As neat as all this sounds, modularity has some obvious downsides. When Apple designs an iPhone, it can cram in parts in the tightest possible manner, as if each new model were a one-of-a-kind jigsaw puzzle. Breaking out hardware features into modules loses that advantage. “A big challenge on this project was that a cell phone is one of the most integrated things that’s made today, and we’re trying to separate it into modular pieces,” says Knaian. “And so the challenge was how to fit everything in an efficient way, so that people could have the ability at home to add and remove modules and have a lot of flexibility about what modules they put in, but not to have too much added weight or too much added cost by doing that.” Keeping the size reasonable was crucial. “When people say ‘modular phone,’” explains Eremenko, “the first thing that jumps to mind is, like, Legos — a big, blocky thing. And so we had to overcome that with the industrial design. That was the first mental hurdle to overcome.” Ara’s masterminds have managed to design a platform that doesn’t suffer from the elephantiasis many have declared an unavoidable side effect of modularity. The modules are 4mm thick — tiles, really, rather than blocks. (The proportions of the smallest ones remind me of an Andes thin mint, though the modules are thinner than the mints.) Inserted into an endoskeleton, the modules form a phone that’s 9.7mm thick in its current prototype form. Later this year, as the design progresses, the designers may allow that to slip to 10mm or so to make room for beefier batteries. That would be noticeably chunkier than the 7.6mm iPhone 5s or 8.1mm Galaxy S5, but only a skosh more so than the 9.3mm HTC One. At least in the design model I got to see in person, the Ara phone is surprisingly elegant-looking. When you slide the modules into the endo, the result is less like Lego, and more like a Mondrian painting rendered in 3D. Google ATAP A work-in-progress functional prototype of an Ara phone, flanked by 3D-printed module enclosures Google is also keen to let consumers specify an Ara phone’s aesthetics as well as its capabilities, which is where 3D Systems’ next-generation 3D printer comes in. It will be able to print 600-dpi color images on module enclosures made out of multiple types of materials, which will be user-swappable. The printer will even be able to treat the enclosure as a surface for one-of-a-kind sculptures: Among Ara’s prototypes is an enclosure bedecked with dozens of microscopic soccer balls. “We want not just to create something that’s custom, and not even just something that’s unique, but actually something that’s expressive so that people can use this as a canvas to tell a story,” says Eremenko. “So that you can set your phone down at dinner on the table next to you, and it becomes a topic of conversation for the first fifteen minutes of dinner.” Between a hardware ecosystem that Google hopes will eventually offer thousands of modules and the infinite opportunity for exterior modifications, configuring an Ara phone will involve a lot of decisions. Gadget geeks would revel in the opportunity, but a lot of folks might react the same way that new-car buyers do when confronted with the responsibility of choosing between multiple options for everything from engines to wheels to floormats. And Google is adamant that it’s not targeting geeks. It wants people who have never even used the Internet to be comfy with the prospect of buying and using an Ara phone — “the alpaca farmer in Peru who might not even have a feature phone today,” as Eremenko describes a typical customer. So the company is developing Android apps that will expedite the configuration process by pinpointing a different set of features and designs for each shopper. When phones are ready for sale, the company plans to get them to consumers in three ways. There will be what Ara’s creators are calling a “grayphone” — that $50 bare-bones version, designed to be sold at convenience stores and running an app that will let buyers begin the process of customizing the phone with additional modules and aesthetic modifications. People will also be able to use the customization app on a friend’s Ara phone to order a handset of their own; Google’s research indicates that choosing a model will be easier if you’ve got a pal helping out. The fullest expression of the Ara sales experience will happen at mobile kiosks, which Google is designing to fit into industry-standard shipping containers for easy transportation to wherever on Earth they’re needed. (A towering wooden frame matching the dimensions of such a container dominates Project Ara’s office space.) The company is still figuring out where they’ll show up first, though it’s likely that phones will be available in one geographic region before any global rollout. Eremenko describes a scenario in which visitors to a kiosk might choose a phone with the help of a special tablet capable of measuring galvanic skin response, sub-voluntary muscle movements, pupil dilation, heart rate and other factors that suggest “whether you’re happy to be configuring your Ara phone, or whether you’re stressed, frustrated, impatient, et cetera.” It would then use that assessment of your mood to steer its recommendations. Another part of the phone-picking process could involve suggestions based on an automated examination of your Facebook or Google+ activity. If your updates show that you’re a frequent traveler, for example, you might be advised to go for a big battery and a wireless carrier with service in the destinations you frequent. Someone whose photos get lots of positive feedback from friends could be pointed towards a serious camera module; if those photos tend to be taken at dusk, it might be a camera with good low-light performance. Eremenko emphasizes that all of this would be optional and done only with the customer’s full knowledge and consent, and that buyers would be able to review and overrule any recommendations. If you’re still creeped out by the prospect of Google poking around in your social networks to that degree — let alone trying determine if you’re sweaty or fidgety — it’s understandable. But don’t fret too much just yet: At launch, it’s likely that not all of the more out-there elements will be ready. And Google isn’t saying when it might start marketing Ara phones in the U.S. Google ATAP A front view of an assembled Ara prototype For all the progress Project Ara has already made, some basic issues remain on the to-do list. For instance, the team hasn’t yet managed to grind the cost for the grayphone down to a $50 price point. Nor is it clear how regulatory agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission, which test and certify new phones to confirm they don’t interfere with other devices, will deal with a smartphone that contains components that consumers can rearrange to their liking. (Eremenko says that the FCC has been encouraging so far: “They see this as good for American industry…this says that, hey, your competitive advantage can be innovation, as opposed to making the same fricking phone a few dollars cheaper.”) Still, the overriding issue with Ara, like any truly new idea, is whether real people will care. Eremenko thinks that when Google can show a working Ara phone, it’ll be its own best advocate. Will the argument that the whole concept is hopelessly naïve fade away? “I think it has to, if you show it and everybody agrees that it’s beautiful, and delightful to the consumer, and it actually works. I’m certain that some level of skepticism will remain: If I drop it, will the modules scatter all over the train platform? And those kinds of things. But the proof is in the demo.” It’s a core tenet of ATAP’s philosophy that projects have a two-year window. So assuming that Ara is viable a year from now, Eremenko and the rest of the team will be winding down their involvement and handing off responsibility to others within Google. At that point, it’ll be a business, not a project. Maybe a huge one someday, if enough people buy Ara phones running Google search, Gmail, Google Maps and other advertising-supported Google services. For the record, Eremenko says that he’s had the luxury of focusing on making sure Ara is great, not profitable: “This is potentially the only thing out there that could turn into a five-billion-unit kind of device. The fact that that will accrue benefits to Google downstream is so obvious that I don’t have to make a business case.” Even if everything goes swimmingly from here on out, addressing a market with billions of potential customers will take a long time — but it may not be all that long until Ara’s prospects are clear enough that the modular-phone doubters are either having the last laugh or eating crow.

A little more than four years ago in 2013, HTC made my favorite Android smartphone: the One. Its sleek metal design set it apart from competing Android phones at the time, many of which felt like they were made of chintzy plastic. The One also had an excellent screen and the best speakers of its class. But while the One’s successors brought mild improvements, they have largely felt like the same phone repackaged with upgraded internals and slightly altered looks. That’s why I was excited to get my hands on the $749 U Ultra, which HTC began shipping in March. The U Ultra marks the first time in years that HTC has released a high-end smartphone that feels dramatically different, eschewing the company’s long-favored metal build for a glossy colored back and a larger frame. The U Ultra also works with HTC’s virtual assistant, called the Sense Companion, and includes a secondary screen that sits atop the main display. Unfortunately, while the One pushed Android smartphone design forward, the U Ultra is a step backwards. The massive 5.7-inch screen is visually impressive, but the phone is so big that it’s unwieldy to actually use. It’s a particularly apparent problem given that rivals like Samsung and LG are finding ways to offer bigger screens without making their phones physically larger, usually by eliminating the bezel around their displays. Part of the problem lies with the HTC Ultra’s new dual display, which sits atop the device’s screen and displays information like calendar alerts, reminders, and weather forecasts. While it sounds useful, I found it to be more distracting than helpful. (LG and Samsung have explored similar features before on their V20 and Galaxy Edge phones, respectively.) The U Ultra’s other headline feature is the Sense Companion virtual aide. HTC promotes it as a proactive digital helper that makes suggestions throughout the day, similar to Google Now. But it’s designed to get to know users better over time, so I couldn’t really get a feel for how well it works during my limited testing period. The U Ultra also features another virtual aide, the Google Assistant, and most users probably won’t find a need to use both. The U Ultra’s 12-megapixel main camera captures crisp images, but the color wasn’t as vibrant as those taken on the iPhone 7 Plus or the Google Pixel. The 16-megapixel front camera was more impressive, balancing the right amount of detail and skin smoothing so that selfies looked polished but not over-processed. Like the iPhone 7 and Moto Z, the U Ultra lacks a headphone jack, but it comes with a pair of earbuds that fit into the phone’s charging slot. That might be a deal breaker for those who have a favorite pair of wired headphones they’re not willing to give up. Another bummer: The U Ultra isn’t as water resistant as the iPhone 7 or Samsung Galaxy S8, both of which can withstand being dipped in water. HTC’s new phone, by comparison, can only endure light sprays such as rain. I also wish the U Ultra better delivered on battery life, as I was only able to get through one full day of usage on a single charge. That’s acceptable, but given its size, I was hoping I’d get a bit more mileage, especially considering the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel typically last me more than a day. (Better battery life is a common benefit of larger phones, which tend to sport bigger, longer-lasting batteries.) There are some things to like about the U Ultra. Its 2,560×1,440 screen is sharp and colorful. The BoomSound speakers offer rich audio that’s louder and clearer than the Google Pixel’s. It also supports up to 2TB of expandable storage, which is rare, as most smartphones top out at 256GB. And the phone certainly sounds promising on paper, with a new virtual assistant, a second screen that lets you see more information at a glance, and a sharp front-facing camera. Unfortunately, most of these features aren’t as useful in practice as they sound. Nor are they compelling enough to keep up with the brisk competition from rivals like Apple, Samsung, and Google, especially at $749. But most of all, the U Ultra is done in by its unwieldy design, which simply makes it too difficult to use in daily life. 2.5 out of 5 stars Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4715110/samsung-galaxy-s8-release-date-price-specs-2017/", "http://time.com/4248284/samsung-galaxy-s7-review-android-edge/"], "sentiment_score": 0.20370670995670997, "subjectivity_score": 0.5116916247018287},

Those devices, released last fall, were recalled shortly thereafter due to overheating batteries. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, as the new phones are named, will go on sale April 21. The price will vary depending on the carrier: Verizon will sell the Galaxy S8 for $720 (or $30 per month) and the Galaxy S8+ for $840 (or $35 per month.) T-Mobile will be offering the Galaxy S8 for $750 (or $30 per month) while the larger model will cost $850 (or $30 per month). A new pair of flagship handsets is always a big deal for any smartphone maker. But the latest Galaxy models bear the extra burden of helping Samsung retain its spot atop the Android phone market after the Note 7 recall, as well as amid increasing competition from rivals like Apple, Google and Huawei. Apple is expected to introduce new iPhone models in September, Google launched its first truly self-made device last year to rave reviews, and Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and OnePlus are making inroads in the U.S. market and abroad. In an effort to prevent issues like those that affected the Note 7, both of Samsung’s new phones have been built following the company’s new battery protocol, which calls for an eight-point safety check. If that new quality control process works as planned, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ could succeed in reversing the company’s misfortunes. Based on the time I spent with the phones during a media preview, both devices appeared to be promising contenders, thanks to new features like an impressive edge-to-edge screen, a new virtual assistant, and facial recognition technology. Pick up one of the Samsung’s new Galaxy devices and the first thing you’ll notice is how big the screen looks. The Galaxy S8 features a 5.8-inch display, while the larger model boasts a 6.2-inch display, both of which are notably larger than the Galaxy S7’s 5.1 inches and the Galaxy 7 Edge’s 5.5 inches. Samsung here ditched the home button in favor of a touch sensor, allowing the screen to be embiggened without making the device physically larger. A slimmer profile, meanwhile, helps the devices feel more manageable to hold than their predecessors. On the software side, a simpler interface also makes the new phones easier to use — instead of an app launcher, users tap the bottom of the screen to view their app library. Samsung diehards will be happy to learn the Galaxy S8 and S8+ inherit fan-favorite features like dust and water resistance, a microSD card slot for expanding storage, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. (Samsung’s doubling the default storage this time around, offering 64GB instead of 32GB.) The Galaxy S8 and S8+ also herald the arrival of Bixby, Samsung’s new voice-activated assistant. The company is aiming to differentiate it from rival services like Apple’s Siri by making it better at understanding situational context, as a human aide would. (Apple, Google, Amazon and other technology firms are also hard at work improving their digital aides in this way.) Samsung claims that Bixby can accomplish any task a user might otherwise do via taps and swipes, though it’s unclear which third-party apps will work with it. Both devices have a dedicated button on their sides for summoning Bixby. And Bixby can use the phones’ camera to scan items and retrieve information about them — one might, for example, get food pairing suggestions by scanning a bottle of wine. (Amazon’s ill-fated Fire Phone also attempted to use its camera in a similar way.) Both the Galaxy S8 and S8+ boast facial recognition and eye-scanning technology allowing owners to unlock their phone by looking at it, the latter of which Samsung debuted on the Note 7. Photography-wise, the new devices show little improvement from the Galaxy S7, though the front-facing camera has been upped to 8 megapixels from 5 and has face-detecting autofocus. Samsung also claims the new phones have better image processing technology, which should help them take better photos in low light and reduce blur. Samsung is additionally pitching its new devices as multi-purpose computers. Both phones can control household gadgets compatible with the company’s SmartThings platform and work with its DeX dock, which simulates the experience of using a desktop. When attached to this dock, the S8’s interface looks like that of a computer rather than a smartphone. Apps optimized for the accessory run full-screen rather than in smaller windows, and the phone will work with enterprise software to run a virtual version of Windows. Microsoft announced a similar feature for its Lumia 950 phone in 2015 called Continuum. Still, it’s unclear how much consumer demand exists for such a feature outside the workplace. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ face the formidable challenge of convincing buyers it’s worth taking another chance on the company’s smartphones after the Note 7 fiasco. To some degree, the company can bank on its brand, having long made some of the best Android handsets available. And based on my limited hands-on time and the spec sheet, these phones might just have what it takes to get Samsung back on track — provided there are no fiery surprises on the horizon.

Can you see them?” The question comes from David Holz, chief technology officer and co-founder of Leap Motion. In any other scenario, the query would seem odd, if not outright insane. But today, I’m sitting in a conference room with a virtual reality (VR) headset strapped to my face. The goggles take me out of the physical world and immerse me in a virtual one that’s a little like being inside Tron. Typically, being in virtual reality means you can’t see anything in the real world, hands included. That makes it tough to interact with objects in the digital space. Some VR headset makers have addressed this problem with joysticks or gamepads similar to traditional video game controllers. But today, for the first time, I have honest-to-goodness virtual hands, complete with wiggling fingers. The difference is subtle and powerful all at once. “Now try picking up that cube,” says Holz continues. I oblige, reaching out into a seemingly infinite space to grab the block in front of me. I fling it across a vast nothingness, because it seemed like the thing to do. Leap Motion’s hands-on demo is powered by the company’s new Orion tracking system. Orion uses a combination of cameras and software to identify users’ hands in the physical space, then imports them into virtual worlds. It’s a proof-of-concept more than anything else. But Holz and his team is hoping that when the beta version is made available Feb. 17, developers will build other more interesting experiences that bring hands into VR for the first time. If they do, it could help Leap Motion capture a slice of the booming virtual reality hardware market, estimated to be worth $70 billion by 2020. One obvious use case: Video games. Imagine hurling boulders at virtual enemies, then pushing open a door to catch your breath. Education is a possibility here, too. Students could learn about astrophysics by interacting with virtual planets the same way they might build a solar system mobile. Still, using Orion felt a little unusual. Using my hands to reach out and lift, move, or shove objects around me was more natural than doing so with a controller. But there’s still one big difference between my real hands and my virtual ones: The latter lack a sense of touch, sometimes breaking VR’s illusion. Other firms, too, are experimenting with ways to bring hand movement into virtual reality. Thalmic Labs’ Myo armband, for instance, works with the Oculus Rift to enable controller-free gameplay. But Leap Motion’s technology differs in that it uses a camera to track movements in users’ hands and fingers, meaning it can detect more detailed movements. The Myo, by comparison, reads muscle movement in the forearm to pick up on a limited set of gestures. While the Orion demo was impressive, it’s up to VR hardware and software creators to integrate the technology into their offerings. The company says it’s working with several VR hardware firms to directly integrate its gadget into headsets, but it won’t offer specific details. In the meantime, Leap Motion’s Orion software will be compatible with its motion controller for laptop and desktop computers.

By console launch standards, that’s a lot (a lotta lot) of software to be available on day one. Of course, if you’ve shelled out $600 for a Rift plus $1,000 either upgrading or flat out buying a new PC to match Oculus’ steep recommended specs, that bounty may elicit a wince. Several of the titles in Oculus’ launch lineup run $50 to $60, so if you’re angling for the full monty, you can add another $600 to your ballooning VR tab. Some of that’s demographic hedging; the Rift’s focus at launch is certainly gaming, but the lineup runs the gamut. You can pick from arcade shooters, flight sims, racers, a hack-and-slash, an action-roleplaying game, real-time strategy and tower defense stuff, a pinball thing, tennis, air hockey, a puzzler, some interactive stories and outliers like a “bomb-defusing” party game. It’s a genre smorgasbord. MORE: Review: Oculus Rift Is Finally Here, But Is It Any Good? One of the launch roster’s most promising games, Lucky’s Tale—a Nintendo-like run-and-jump game where you guide a pirouetting fox through a cartoonish 3D world—comes bundled with the Rift. And if you preordered the headset, you’ll get a copy of EVE Valkyrie as well, arguably a bargain considering CCP’s online space fighter costs $60 standalone. If you’ve got a Rift and you’re looking for what to play, here are my five favorite launch games so far: Gunfire Games’ Chronos marries the shifting camera angles of Alone in the Dark and the regal otherworldly look of ICO, then drops your virtual noggin into the spaces where fixed cameras would be. It’s a third-person action fantasy where you watch the hero navigate a vast multi-dimensional labyrinth from a static position that automatically shifts as you cross invisible thresholds between one area and the next. Since this is virtual reality, you can peer in any direction, popping your head out from under a ledge to take in the panoramic sweep of stratospheric cliffs, or craning your neck to notice a pair of smoldering eyeballs in the darkness off center. And dying is no simple slate-cleaning affair: each time you perish, your character has to wait a year to reenter the labyrinth, gradually altering the balance of tactics as you age, growing physically slower, but wiser. $49.99 Defense Grid 2 looks like a straightforward port of Hidden Path’s existing PC tower defense game to virtual reality. But the allure lies in just how simple and intuitive it is to use your head in lieu of a mouse or joystick to survey arresting sci-fi battlefields, scrutinizing ant-like robots as they attempt to bypass your matrix of (hopefully) well-positioned and upgraded defensive turrets. The gameplay doesn’t change in VR, and yet pulling on a headset adds something important and indelible to the experience—a sense of being present and therefore invested in the world your can’t get from the non-VR version. And since Defense Grid 2 is a tower defense game, where you’re meant to pan every which way around levels and fuss over all the splendid toy-box minutia, it’s as natural and simultaneously uncanny as watching a real-world diorama come to life. $29.99 If you didn’t preorder the Rift, you’ll pay $60 for the privilege of playing CCP’s arcade-style space sim. But if you want the best online-focused dogfighter in VR, this is it. If there’s a point EVE Valkyrie on Rift drives home, it’s that being able to use your head to pan naturally around a multi-windowed cockpit while piloting a heavily armed fighter may be the difference between playing another enthusiast thrill-ride, and CCP helping resuscitate a long-quiet genre in gaming (flight sims). $59.99 MORE: Everything You Need to Know About the Oculus Rift It’s you, in a tiny room, with a ticking bomb, and you haven’t the faintest idea to defuse it. Except your friends—not in the room, but in earshot—do, because they have the bomb “defusal” manual. Can you work together to share fussy details about wiring and arcane symbols to save your soft-bodied self from exploding? Sure, you can play the game without a headset. But ask the poor soul wearing one (and trapped in a room with a live freaking bomb!) how much more they care about saving their bacon, than were they eyeing the bomb on a lifeless flat screen. $14.99 Futuristic race cars hurtle over pulsing tubes that snake through 3D-space with hazards you can only anticipate if you snap your view toward the ceiling.

You already know his work, even if you don’t know his name: Carmack is the programmer who in the early 1990s cracked the problem of how to write a video game that takes place in three-dimensional space. He’s the reason that when you play a state-of-the-art game, you’re not leaping from platform to platform or wandering through a two-dimensional dungeon, you’re running and jumping around in proper space-time, all six axes in play, backward and forward, side to side, up and down. He’s responsible for Quake, the first true 3-D game, which begat Halo and Call of Duty and all the rest of it. Carmack did for computer games what Masaccio did for painting: he turned a plane into a space. As such, he’s the principal architect of a medium that has generated literally billions of person–hours of entertainment over the past 20 years, and like most people who’ve started a revolution, he keeps a weather eye out for the next one. That’s how he spotted Palmer Luckey and Oculus Rift two years before Mark Zuckerberg and most of the rest of the world. On March 26, Facebook announced that it was purchasing Oculus VR, the company Luckey started in 2012, in a deal worth $2 billion. The social-networking giant is getting top-flight engineering expertise as well as the technology behind the company’s flagship and only product, a virtual-reality headset. “Mobile is the platform of today, and now we’re also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,” Zuckerberg said in a press conference. “Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever and change the way we work, play and communicate.” Two billion dollars is a lot of money—a head-snapping amount—for a social network to pay for a two-year-old hardware company with an ultra-nerdy name that has yet to ship a consumer-ready product and whose founder is still only 21. But what’s really surprising is that Zuckerberg is putting down a massive bet on virtual reality, which until very recently was considered not just a failure but a punch line. The Oculus deal makes for a twist ending to one of the greatest and weirdest comeback stories in the history of technology. Palmer Luckey—the name suits him—grew up in Long Beach, Calif., the son of a housewife and a car salesman. He was a natural-born tinkerer. “Self-taught!” is how he describes himself. “Explore the world around you, take things apart, put ’em back together. You can learn a lot if you do nothing but spend your entire life in your garage working on projects or in your room reading on the Internet.” As a teenager one of Luckey’s hobbies was taking apart old video-game consoles and reassembling them inside portable cases. Another one was virtual reality. It was an odd hobby for a person Luckey’s age because the received wisdom at the time was that VR was a failed technology. Everybody has an idea of what VR is, or what it’s supposed to be: a simulated, three-dimensional, interactive world that surrounds you completely. It’s been a staple of science-fiction classics—Neuromancer, Snow Crash, Tron, Star Trek, The Matrix—and a core component of our collective pop-cultural vision of the future for decades. But apart from niche applications like designing cars and surveying oil fields, VR never made it to market. As Luckey puts it, “the idea existed, the will existed, the people existed, the demand existed—and the technology did not.” It baffled engineers, frustrated consumers and ate up billions of dollars of R&D money. Like flying cars and robot butlers, VR is one of those revolutions that went from wow to lame without ever actually materializing in between. Nintendo tried its hand at it in 1995 with the Virtual Boy game console and lost millions. The list of virtual-reality products that launched and then died of neglect is long. Luckey owns most of them. He probably has the world’s most complete collection of VR headsets anywhere, more than 40 of them at last count. He bought them because he was among the very few people anywhere who still thought virtual reality was cool. Unfortunately, none of the headsets worked very well. “I didn’t start out trying to build something,” he says. “I started out trying to buy something that would do what I wanted. And it became apparent that there wasn’t anything like it.” So he started building it himself. Luckey wasn’t the only person who still cared about virtual reality, but he almost was. There was a small community of true believers, less than a hundred, who hung out on a web forum called MTBS3D to talk about it. (MTBS stands for “meant to be seen.”) Luckey was one of them. John Carmack was another. Carmack thought VR had potential too, in spite of all the failures, and every few years he would check in on the state of the art to see if it was usable yet. In April 2012, Carmack was tinkering with a VR headset made by Sony, and he posted about it on MTBS3D. Luckey responded. He told Carmack about his own prototype, and Carmack said he’d like to buy one. Luckey was in awe. “You cannot take money from Carmack,” he says. “It would be like if Jesus said, Give me your clothes.” He sent Carmack the prototype, his only working model, for free, via regular mail. Luckey’s device wasn’t like other headsets. In 2012, what interest there was in VR was mostly in creating a kind of virtual cinema: you’d look in the headset and see a simulated version of a giant screen hanging in the air in front of you, and you’d watch a movie on it. Not many people did. Not only was it Skymall stuff, it was pricey—Sony’s head-mounted set costs $1,000. Luckey’s device was different. It was designed to run games and to immerse you in them. It ran fast, and its field of view was very wide: the display wrapped around to eat up your peripheral vision, putting you well and truly in another world. “That’s the only way to get any kind of immersion,” Luckey says. “I didn’t want to just have a TV you could wear.” Carmack agreed. He adapted his latest game engine for Luckey’s headset. Two months later he took it to E3, the biggest video-gaming trade show in North America, where he announced to a startled press corps that virtual reality had finally arrived. A lot of people started asking Luckey for demos. Among them were Brendan Iribe and Nate Mitchell, both alumni of a gaming-software company called Scaleform. “The first time I saw the Rift, it was in a hotel in Long Beach,” Mitchell says. “Basically Palmer had a bunch of circuit boards, and a bucket of cables and wires, all this stuff tangled up. He set it up, plugged it in—it took him a little while, and I was sitting there being like, Is this really going to happen? Is this going to work?” At that point Luckey’s prototype was just a box that you held up to your face, running a simulation of a bare room. But when Mitchell looked inside it, something new happened. “There was no interactivity, nothing moving,” he says. “But it gave you the sensation that, wow—there’s a world inside this little box.” Two years later, the Oculus Rift—the dorky name is a point of nerd pride—still doesn’t look particularly futuristic. It looks like a pair of chunky ski goggles with opaque black plastic where the lenses should be. Time will tell whether it’s a gateway to a new virtual frontier, but one thing is clear already: you look weird wearing it. But put it on anyway—it embraces your head slightly more forcefully than would be ideally comfortable—because you’ll get the rare sensation of experiencing a technology that is genuinely new. Google Glass feels like what it looks like: you put it on and think, Yup, it’s a pair of glasses with a tiny screen in one lens. Oculus Rift is different. It’s not what you expect. The first time I tried the Rift (which seems to be winning out over Oculus as the shorthand of choice) it showed a simulation of a craggy, rocky mountainside. I turned my head experimentally, and the view changed, with no discernible lag, just as it would have in reality. Instinctively my brain started looking for the edge of the image—but it didn’t come. I kept turning until I was looking all the way behind me. There was nothing but mountain back there. Then I looked up and watched snowflakes sift down out of a gray sky straight into my face. That’s when my brain admitted defeat. It surrendered to the illusion that it was in another world. It wasn’t going to find an edge. There were no edges. The Oculus Rift is the first visual medium that doesn’t have a frame around it. Another demo put me in the driver’s seat of an old-fashioned race car. Just sitting there, without even starting the engine, was a revelation. I leaned over and stuck my head out the window and admired the car’s exposed left front wheel assembly. If I leaned in to the dashboard I could read the fine print on the gauges. When you’re in the Rift you become the camera. You control the point of view with your body, the way you would in reality. The Oculus Rift has limitations. The resolution isn’t high enough yet, so you have a slight sense that you’re viewing the world from inside a screened-in porch. Look down and you’ll notice that something’s missing: your entire body. Oculus can bring your eyes and, with headphones, your ears into the virtual world, but nothing else. You haunt the virtual world as a floating, disembodied spirit. And yet it’s convincing. It’s visceral. VR offers a new kind of illusion. There’s a name for it in the industry, this deep and abiding conviction that you’re somewhere else: presence. I tried a simulation of a dogfight in outer space, and when my one-man fighter was shot out of the mother ship into the cold black void, my stomach dropped through the floor. After South by Southwest this year, a viral video circulated of the actress Maisie Williams trying an Oculus Rift simulation of the 700-ft. wall of ice in Game of Thrones. She’s standing on solid ground, but she has a full-blown panic attack—she’s afraid of heights. The illusion of being on a cliff edge is tenacious. “You can’t do that on a TV monitor,” Mitchell says. “You can’t do that on a phone. You’ve never been able to do that before in the history of humankind. You know you’re not going to fall, but your brain’s saying, Don’t take that step.” Two years after he mailed his prototype headset to John Carmack, Palmer Luckey is somewhere else: a black glass office tower in Irvine, Calif., the headquarters of Oculus VR, where he now has the title of founder. Carmack, 43, is his CTO. After 22 years he quit his job at Id Software, the company he co-founded, to work at Oculus. Brendan Iribe is now Oculus’ ebullient, hyperverbal CEO. He left behind unvested options from his last company to come to Oculus. It has that effect on people. Why could Oculus solve VR when nobody else could? The answer takes some explaining. VR presents an intractable mass of interconnected engineering challenges, most of which start with your brain. The problem with your brain is that it’s smart, and it’s difficult to fool. The human brain is constantly taking in data about the world. Some of it comes in through your eyes; some of it comes from your vestibular system, your inner ear, which provides your sense of balance and orientation. Your brain’s constantly cross-checking those data sources to make sure they match up. If they don’t, bad things happen. Say, for example, you’re wearing a virtual–reality headset that is telling your eyes that you’re on Mars. If you move your head, the view of Mars has to change too—instantly, with no latency, the way it would in reality. If it doesn’t, your eyes get out of sync with your inner ear. Even a delay of 50 milliseconds between head-turn and view-change is too much. Your brain will spot it. In fact, it’ll get really upset about it. So much so that it makes people feel nauseated—it’s one cause of a phenomenon known as simulator sickness, which is similar to motion sickness. Individuals’ tolerance for latency varies, but at Oculus they peg the maximum allowable lag at 20 milliseconds. On a technical level, that’s a challenging specification to hit. By comparison, an eyeblink takes about 300 milliseconds. A headset also has to deliver new frames to the eye absurdly fast in order to keep the image from smearing or freezing when you move. It has to have two tiny high-definition monitors in it, one for each eye, and they have to cover a field of view wide enough that it blankets your peripheral vision. It has to be simple enough to mass-produce and cheap enough that people can afford it. It has to be light enough that it doesn’t hurt your nose. Getting this kind of precision requires tight integration of hardware and software—it’s one of the mantras you hear around the Oculus offices. And beyond that, it takes a solid grasp of the fundamentals of gaming technology. That’s where a guy like Carmack, who invented some of the technology in question, comes in handy. “The science around this is so close to the metal,” Iribe says. “It’s so close to what bits are happening when. Carmack knows he can go in and get that fully optimized.” Oculus began on Aug. 2, 2012, with a campaign on Kickstarter. The goal was to raise $250,000; the project passed that figure in two hours. By the time the campaign closed 30 days later, backers had pledged $2,437,429. Since then Oculus has taken 75,000 orders for its development kit, which is a nonfinal, prerelease version of the headset intended primarily as a tool for people who want to write software and develop content for it. In December it closed a $75 million round of financing from venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Then, of course, came the Facebook purchase. Not even the founders saw it coming, or not at first. Zuckerberg first met Iribe last November. “He came down,” Iribe recalls, “and we showed him some of the internal prototypes, and he got so excited about the vision of what we were doing and about the potential that this is truly the next computing platform. He actually said that to us. And it’s like, ‘Wow! We are looking at this whole thing being just that gaming platform. But tell us more, Mark.’ And he started to describe it, and we started to believe it too. And we started to relate it to a lot of the experiences we were having.” It had been dawning on Luckey and Iribe and their colleagues for some time that they might not be as clear as they thought they were on what virtual reality is actually for. It began as a gaming technology, but it turned out first-person shooters weren’t the killer app they expected. “Pretty quickly we realized, ‘O.K., maybe running down hallways at 40 m.p.h. isn’t exactly the most comfortable thing to do in VR when you’re sitting in a chair,’” Iribe says. “As we started to build these made-for-VR experiences, we started to realize that intense gaming, where there are bullets flying at your head, can be actually a little too intense.” So they started thinking more broadly about what exactly it was they were building. Iribe mentions virtual vacations and a 3-D VR encyclopedia as future possibilities. Mitchell describes a “magic school bus” that could take a bunch of kids on an instant field trip to Florence to look at Michelangelo’s David. But the really big opportunity, the mainstream, billion-user opportunity, was in virtual reality as a next-next-generation communications medium. “When you add other people to it,” Iribe says, “and you can actually see somebody in that place and you can make eye contact, and you can look at them and they can look around, you can now have this shared sense of presence in this new gaming experience, entertainment experience or just social experience that really starts to define what virtual reality is all about.” The news that Facebook was acquiring Oculus was not received with universal happiness in the gaming community that had backed the company in the first place. The announcement on Oculus’ blog quickly grew a comment trail 900-plus posts long essentially arguing, in various ways, that Oculus had abandoned its hardcore hacker roots to become a bland, corporate, three-dimensional ad-serving platform. Markus Persson, the creator of Minecraft, was an early backer, and he visited the Oculus offices earlier this year. He summed up the attitude when he tweeted to his 1.54 million followers, “We were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus. I just canceled that deal. Facebook creeps me out.” Luckey is quick, very quick, to assert that this isn’t a pivot away from gaming and toward something else. “Nope,” he says. “No pivot. We’re doing what we’ve always done. We’re continuing to operate independently, and if anything, we’re putting more resources into games, not less. This lets us invest in content, make better tools for content, better developer relations, and build a much better platform for games.” Iribe is right behind him: “People have not even seen our final form. There are so many cool things that happened directly because of this deal. It’s one thing to have an initial first impression of a deal that might not make sense on the outside. It’s another to see the proof of it once the big picture becomes clear.” Iribe points out one concrete benefit for users: cheaper headsets. Now Oculus can afford to sell them at cost. “It changes our priorities from making money to making virtual reality happen.” Iribe rejects the idea that he and his colleagues sold out. “If anything, I think Facebook got an incredibly good deal,” he says. “If we stayed independent, we could probably have made a lot more.” Brian Blau, a consumer technology analyst at research firm Gartner, says, “They want to seed the market. They want to get it in front of more developers and more early adopters. And that’s the way to do it, to give it away as cheaply as they can.” Zuckerberg clearly has a lot of faith in the Oculus team, because as far as they’ve come, there are a lot of technical challenges left to solve before virtual reality can become a social medium at all. It will have to track more than your head: it’ll have to track your hands, your mouth, your facial expressions, your gaze. That’s not part of the existing technology. At the moment virtual reality is still a pretty lonely place. It will also have to morph into a form factor that nontechnophiles will be willing to put on their faces. And it will face competition. Earlier this month Sony unveiled a new VR headset of its own, with the working name Project Morpheus. It will presumably connect to its popular Playstation 4 console, which already has millions of users. For the next few years at least, Oculus VR is going to be what it started out as: a high-end gaming peripheral, supplemented with content from adventurous creatives in the broader entertainment world. “We’re working a lot with people who want to do things like immersive movies or music videos or meditation or relaxation applications,” Iribe says. “It’s kind of like the beginning of film. It’s going to take this whole new set of mechanics and engineering to master it. We have no idea what really works in VR. People ask us, What’s the holy-grail app going to be? I have no idea! Don’t know.” The uncertainty doesn’t bother him. For now, Luckey and Carmack and the rest of them are still poised at the crest of the wave. Their money worries are over. Now they just have to safeguard what made Oculus so exciting in the first place, back when it was just a box with a room inside it. “I think people have always wanted to experience the impossible,” Luckey says. “That’s one of the reasons games have caught on. They want to actually do things themselves, have a say in how that world works, instead of just watching someone else do it.” With reporting by Victor Luckerson Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.09266606541606547, "subjectivity_score": 0.45392384261828717},

Take the upcoming No Man’s Sky, a richly rendered universe players can explore almost infinitely. Or current titles such as Destiny and Fallout 4, which allow you to customize a character indefinitely. And yet, despite being mesmerizing, none of these games has made me feel like I’m in a different place physically. None actually made my stomach drop or prompted me to reflexively look over my shoulder to make sure I wasn’t being followed. These are the types of experiences I had while gaming in virtual reality for the first time using Samsung’s new Gear VR headset. It was far more addicting than I had expected. A ton of companies, from Sony to Facebook’s Oculus, are betting virtual reality is the future of entertainment. But so far, few headsets have actually hit market. Most will likely be expensive when the are released, costing several hundreds of dollars. Samsung’s Gear VR is a $100 virtual reality headset that’s compatible with the company’s newest phones. It recently became available through Samsung’s website, Amazon, and Best Buy. It differs from other similar products in that it’s actually powered by your phone—simply plug a compatible phone into the front of the device, and it automatically launches the Oculus interface. That’s right Oculus. Samsung’s virtual reality experience is based on Oculus VR’s platform, which means Gear VR users will have access to some of the same apps that will be available for the Oculus Rift when it launches. Because of its low price and early arrival, Samsung’s Gear VR is likely to be the first taste of virtual reality for many people. Here’s what it’s like: Wearing it Make no mistake, the Gear VR, like other VR headsets, is not one of those wearable tech products that’s meant to blend in with your everyday attire. When strapped to your face, it looks like a contraption from science fiction. That’s not necessarily a bad thing; the Gear VR isn’t a fashion accessory. It’s meant to be a personal entertainment device that’ll likely be used in your own home rather than out in public. (But, hey, who knows?) The headset itself is comfortable to wear extensively, so long as your eyes are adjusted to the gargantuan bright screen that appears when you put it on. Soft foam lines the portion of the device that sits on your face, and it’s lightweight enough to move freely while using. First-time VR users will probably have to take a few minutes to adjust their eyes to the screen, especially those who wear contact lenses like me. The sheer brightness of the screen felt unmanageable during the first few minutes, but after about 15 minutes or so my eyes quickly adjusted. Using it New technology products are often only as good as the apps you can use with them. In the case of the Gear VR, there are 100 apps available for the headset with 40 more on the way. Other than a few occasional hiccups, the several apps that I sampled ran smoothly and felt immersive. Adventure Time: Magic Man’s Head Games, which is based on the popular Cartoon Network TV show, is among the more polished games available for the Gear VR. It requires a video game controller to play, which needs to be purchased separately, but it’s astounding to see how virtual reality expands what it feels like to play a game. In this action adventure game, the player follows two main characters, Finn and Jake, while battling enemies. You technically play as Finn since you’re controlling him from a third-person perspective, but in the game you’re meant to be a third character that follows the pair throughout their adventures. I instinctively tried to rotate the camera using the right joystick on the controller to see what was behind my character, just like I usually would when playing a console game. It took a minute to register—as it does with most people who are new to virtual reality—that I had to physically turn around in my seat to see the world behind me. It felt completely new. When the game begins, you start as a small character that’s shorter than both Finn and Jake. Later, your character grows to be gigantic, and it actually feels like you’re moving upward as the character elongates. Because the movement was unexpected, it actually made my stomach drop a bit. Dead Secret is another example of a captivating game for the Gear VR. It’s a murder mystery in which you’re a reporter digging through an abandoned house for clues about how the owner died. It’s chilling yet entertaining, and in some instances deeply creepy. During one scene, I jumped to turn around after seeing a faint shadow behind my character’s reflection in the mirror. Virtual reality isn’t just for video games. There are a host of apps designed for travel, education, and social interaction as well. One such app, for instance, transported me to Mars to learn about the different types of landscapes there. Many Gear VR apps worked well, but there are some in which virtual reality doesn’t enhance the experience whatsoever. Netflix is one example. Although the app creates the experience of watching movies and TV on a large screen television, it was too bright to comfortably watch for the duration of a TV show. The downsides While the Gear VR is enjoyable and exciting to use, it isn’t perfect. The device isn’t for everybody; it’s only for those who already own one of Samsung’s newest phones or are willing to buy one. The Gear VR is compatible with Samsung’s Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, and Galaxy S6 Edge+, and it won’t work with any phones not made by Samsung. In certain instances, it’s also hard to navigate. The touchpad along the side of the headset, which is the primary means of interacting with the device, is sometimes difficult to find when the goggles are in use. The touchpad has a smooth plastic feel to it just like the rest of the headset, making it hard to distinguish y blind touch. What makes using apps in virtual reality feel so new and different is the notion that it feels as if you’re inside the app rather than just poking at it. This means whether you look up, down, to the left or to the right, you’ll see whatever environment the app believes you to be in. I found that while using the Gear VR, the headset would occasionally lose focus when I moved my head from side to side. As a result, I had to adjust my focus using the wheel at the top of the headgear often. Final thoughts The Samsung Gear VR may not be perfect, but it’s captivating enough to persuade me that virtual reality has the potential to be more than a niche. It’s an early entrant to the modern virtual reality space, which means it’s only likely to get better once the competition becomes more intense. If you already own a compatible Samsung phone or plan on buying the Gear VR for someone who does, it’s a worthwhile choice. 4 out of 5 Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/39577/facebook-oculus-vr-inside-story/", "http://time.com/3987022/why-virtual-reality-is-about-to-change-the-world/"], "sentiment_score": 0.11924274188425131, "subjectivity_score": 0.5350510949567554},

The first came in 2000 when the company’s search page suggested it could read users’ minds. (It couldn’t.) A few years later, Google told people it would deliver emails on old-fashioned paper through the post office. (It didn’t.) And then there was a 2007 plan to build a broadband network using sewage pipes called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider. (It’s not clear how many people dropped a fiber optic cable down their commode to try it out.) So it was no surprise that when Google announced in June of 2014 that it had built a virtual reality headset almost entirely of cardboard, many people thought it was another of the company’s gags—if several months delayed. The project, dubbed Google Cardboard, has been anything but a joke. On Jan. 27, Google will announce that 5 million Cardboard have shipped. More importantly, the company says people are using them: 25 million Cardboard apps have been downloaded from its Play Store, meaning users have tried an average of five different experiences. The most popular app for the device is Chair in a Room, a surprisingly unsettling first-person horror game. But Cardboard apps range from rollercoaster simulators to field trips visits to well-known global monuments. Cardboard may be the lowest-tech gadget in the history of modern consumer electronics. Its ingredients include about half a pizza box worth of cardboard, two magnets, a couple pieces of Velcro, two lenses and a single rubber band. Pop in a smartphone loaded with the right apps, and Cardboard becomes a virtual reality viewer. When you first see a Google Cardboard unit in person, it’s hard to believe it can do anything impressive. Then you put it on. Read more: I finally tried virtual reality and it brought me to tears In an era of blockbuster Kickstarter campaigns, major partnerships, and multi-billion-dollar acquisitions, Google’s recyclable virtual reality viewer may be the most popular “device” for the nascent technology. It would’ve been easy for Google to mark the win and forget about Cardboard as a stunt, if a highly impactful one. But Google has built on Cardboard’s success, adding new features to the device and accompanying software, like better audio. It has fostered a community of developers, crucial for getting fresh content and attracting new users. And it struck high-profile deals to give Cardboard viewers to more people, including one with The New York Times. At least some of the credit for Cardboard’s early success belongs to Googler Clay Bavor, who recently marked his tenth anniversary with the Mountain View, Calif. firm. Bavor has been leading the Cardboard team since close to the beginning, while running the product and design teams responsible for some of Google’s most well-known software, like Gmail and Google Docs. Bavor describes Cardboard’s early difficulties, such as figuring how to interact with a smartphone that’s stuck inside a paper box. Smartphones have so-called magnetometers, which measure the strength and direction of magnetic fields. They’re meant to help phones figure out which direction they’re pointed in and make features like working compasses possible. So the team added metal magnets to Cardboard’s hardware, then created software to interpret shifts in their magnetic field as a user’s “click.” “The interesting thing about Cardboard is, the smartphones weren’t built for VR,” says Bavor. “With the exception of a few, they were all designed and built before Cardboard existed. So there’s no thought about how you could optimize a smartphone to make it great not only as a smartphone, but also as the core of a VR device.” Read more: Everything to know about virtual reality Bavor says he’s been obsessed with the idea of making unreal things look realistic since he was a child. That led to interests in photorealism, computer modeling, and virtual reality. When Google recently decided to open a dedicated VR department, Bavor was a natural choice to run it. “I kind of became known inside Google as the VR nerd,” he tells TIME in his first interview since being named Google’s vice president of virtual reality earlier this month. “When David Coz, who was the engineer from the Paris office, showed up in Mountain View with the first Google Cardboard prototype it wasn’t long before someone said, ‘Clay needs to see this.'” That Google is putting resources into a new division, even as it seeks to streamline its operations under a wider reorganization, shows the firm wants to take virtual reality—promising but unproven technology—seriously. (Google has also invested in augmented reality startup Magic Leap). Still, Cardboard only offers an entry-level virtual reality experience. It’s likely the least-expensive gateway device to virtual reality. Forthcoming high-end virtual reality headsets from Oculus, Valve, Microsoft and Sony will cost anywhere from several hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the computers needed to make them run. They will, for the price, offer much more immersive experiences. Samsung sells its Gear VR for $99, but it only works with that company’s line of phones. Worldwide sales of virtual reality gear are expected to rise to nearly $16 billion annually by 2020, estimates researcher Markets and Markets.  Is Google working on higher-end VR hardware? Bavor won’t say exactly. “The amazing thing about Cardboard is that it’s truly VR for everyone with a smartphone,” he says. “We think there’s something powerful and important in that. Is that the end of the line? Of course it’s not the end of the line. I think if you imagine the types of things that a company with the ambition and the technical resources and the know-how of Google would be working on, we’re working on a lot of those things.” Ultimately, Bavor says Google’s goal is putting virtual reality in the hands of as many people as possible. Or as he puts it, “VR is too important and too powerful a medium to be accessible to only a few.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4172998/virtual-reality-oculus-rift-htc-vive-ces/", "http://time.com/4180621/google-cardboard-headset-audio/", "http://time.com/4122253/virtual-reality/", "http://time.com/3991647/google-alphabet/", "http://time.com/4169188/virtual-reality-vr-oculus-rift-computer/"], "sentiment_score": 0.16712785146295786, "subjectivity_score": 0.5083908231248656},

MORE: Review: The Oculus Rift Is Finally Here, But Is It Any Good? Imagine strapping on a pair of safety goggles—you know, the kind you can buy at any hardware store with wide elastic straps and that lie flush against your face around your eyes and nose. Now imagine a posher, more comfortable version of those, only the goggle portion protrudes several inches further from your face, plus it’s solid black, to block any external light. Instead of gazing at a flat plastic wall, you’re peering through a pair of special lenses that refract the light from twin tiny high-end video screens (sitting just behind the lenses), which work with motion sensors in the headset to create the illusion of a wraparound alternate reality as you naturally swivel or nod your head. Those alt-realities at launch consist mostly of games at this point: arcade shooters, flight sims, racers, a hack-and-slash, an action-roleplaying game, real-time strategy and tower defense stuff, a pinball thing, a tennis sim, air hockey, a puzzler, some interactive stories and outliers like a “bomb-defusing” party game. The Rift will launch with 30 games, and Oculus promises you’ll be able to pick from over 100 Rift games by year’s end. The Rift headset lists for $599. But it also requires a high-end PC, and the 30 launch titles run from as little as $5 to as much as $60. All told, if you buy the Rift, a fully “Oculus Ready” PC and a handful of games, you’re looking at spending $1,600 to $1,700. MORE: These Are the 5 Best Oculus Rift Launch Games The Rift goes on sale March 28, but don’t expect to find a headset lying around if you didn’t preorder back in early January. Orders processed mere days after the Rift went on sale January 6 may not be processed for weeks after the official launch date, according to Oculus. If you want to reserve a spot in the backorder queue, Oculus says you can grab the Rift from Oculus direct at Oculus.com, or through retailers like Amazon, Best Buy and the Microsoft Store. The Rift box includes:   You also get a copy of studio Playful’s Lucky’s Tale (a whimsical run-and-jump adventure game), and if you preordered the Rift, a copy of CCP’s EVE Valkyrie (an online-focused arcade space sim). The Rift headset includes:   And the sensor/camera includes:   The Rift’s recommended specs are as follows:   Oculus Rift games will run on lesser hardware, but you then you risk running into performance issues that, given how critical high and consistent frame rates are to soothing your hoodwinked visual cortex, could make your feel ill. Note that the most impactful (and expensive) component above is the video card. If you already have a PC and plan to upgrade just the video card, models based on Nvidia’s GTX 970 or AMD’s R9 290 GPUs sell in the mid to high $300s, depending on the manufacturer and processor clock speeds. If you plan (or need) to buy a completely new PC, “Oculus Ready” systems run in the vicinity of $1,000, but you can save a few bucks if you buy them bundled with the Rift headset. MORE: Why Virtual Reality Is About to Change the World Oculus says the Rift “is not intended for children under 13 years old.” Why 13? Because 12 to 13 is the age range VR manufacturers have settled on absent guidance from medical professionals or data from long term usage studies. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe has said the company went with 13 because that’s where Facebook (which owns Oculus) draws the line. You won’t know until you try it. Games that make some ill, others have no trouble with. The law of averages does seem to apply here, and to that end, Oculus has established a “Comfort Ratings” system designed offer general guidance. Look for these ratings on each Oculus game:   Very carefully, and with nothing more than a dry microfiber cloth. Oculus also says to keep the headset, sensor and remote out of direct sunlight. Yes, one for each hand, but they’ll cost extra, and won’t be available until the second half of 2016. Until then, Rift games are restricted to input from the headset itself and the Xbox One gamepad.

He believed that one day machines would become so powerful that they would think just like humans. He even devised a test, which he called “the imitation game,” to herald the advent of computers that were indistinguishable from human minds. But as Benedict Cumberbatch’s performance in the new movie The Imitation Game shows, Turing’s heroic and tragic life provides a compelling counter to the concept that there might be no fundamental difference between our minds and machines. As we celebrate the cool inventions that sprouted this year, it’s useful to look back at the most important invention of our age, the computer, which along with its accoutrements, microchips and digital networks is the über innovation from which most subsequent Ubers and innovations were born. But despite the computer’s importance, most of us don’t know who invented it. That’s because, like most innovations of the digital age, it has no single creator, no Bell or Edison or Morse or Watt. Instead, the computer was devised during the early 1940s in a variety of places, from Berlin to the University of Pennsylvania to Iowa State, mainly by collaborative teams. As often seen in the annals of invention, the time was right and the atmosphere charged. The mass manufacture of vacuum tubes for radios paved the way for the creation of electronic digital circuits. That was accompanied by theoretical advances in logic that made circuits more useful. And the march was quickened by the drums of war. As nations armed for conflict, it became clear that computational power was as important as firepower. Which is what makes the Turing story especially compelling. He was the seminal theorist conceptualizing the idea of a universal computer, he was part of the secret team at Bletchley Park, England, that put theory into practice by building machines that broke the German wartime codes, and he framed the most fundamental question of the computer age: Can machines think? Having survived a cold upbringing on the fraying fringe of the British gentry, Turing had a lonely intensity to him, reflected in his love of long-distance running. At boarding school, he realized he was gay. He became infatuated with a fair-haired schoolmate, Christopher Morcom, who died suddenly of tuberculosis. Turing also had a trait, so common among innovators, that was charmingly described by his biographer Andrew Hodges: “Alan was slow to learn that indistinct line that separated initiative from disobedience.” At Cambridge University, Turing became fascinated by the math of quantum physics, which describes how events at the subatomic level are governed by statistical probabilities rather than laws that determine things with certainty. He believed (at least while he was young) that this uncertainty and indeterminacy at the subatomic level permitted humans to exercise free will–a trait that, if it existed, would seem to distinguish them from machines. He had an instinct that there were mathematical statements that were likewise elusive: we could never know whether they were provable or not. One way of framing the issue was to ask whether there was a “mechanical process” that could be used to determine whether a particular logical statement was provable. Turing liked the concept of a “mechanical process.” One day in the summer of 1935, he was out for his usual solitary run and stopped to lie down in a grove of apple trees. He decided to take the notion of a “mechanical process” literally, conjuring up an imaginary machine and applying it to the problem. The “Logical Computing Machine” that Turing envisioned (as a thought experiment, not as a real machine to be built) was simple at first glance, but it could handle, in theory, any mathematical computation. It consisted of an unlimited length of paper tape containing symbols within squares; the machine would be able to read the symbols on the tape and perform certain actions based on a “table of instructions” it had been given. Turing showed that there was no method to determine in advance whether any given instruction table combined with any given set of inputs would lead the machine to arrive at an answer or go into some loop and continue chugging away indefinitely, getting nowhere. This discovery was useful for the development of mathematical theory. But more important was the by-product: Turing’s concept of a Logical Computing Machine, which soon came to be known as a Turing machine. “It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence,” he declared. Turing’s interest was more than theoretical, however. Fascinated by ciphers, Turing enlisted in the British effort to break Germany’s military codes. The secret teams set up shop on the grounds of a Victorian manor house in the drab redbrick town of Bletchley. Turing was assigned to a group tackling the Germans’ Enigma code, which was generated by a portable machine with mechanical rotors and electrical circuits. After every keystroke, it changed the formula for substituting letters. Turing and his team built a machine, called “the bombe,” that exploited subtle weaknesses in the German coding, including the fact that no letter could be enciphered as itself and that there were certain phrases that the Germans used repeatedly. By August 1940, Turing’s team had bombes that could decipher German messages about the deployment of the U-boats that were decimating British supply convoys. The bombe was not a significant advance in computer technology. It was an electromechanical device with relay switches rather than vacuum tubes and electronic circuits. But a subsequent machine produced at Bletchley, known as Colossus, was a major milestone. The need for Colossus arose when the Germans started coding important messages, including orders from Hitler, with a machine that used 12 code wheels of unequal size. To break it would require using lightning-quick electronic circuits. The team in charge was led by Max Newman, who had been Turing’s math don at Cambridge. Turing introduced Newman to the electronics wizard Tommy Flowers, who had devised wondrous vacuum-tube circuits while working for the British telephone system. They realized that the only way to analyze German messages quickly enough was to store one of them in the internal electronic memory of a machine rather than trying to compare two punched paper tapes. This would require 1,500 vacuum tubes. The Bletchley Park managers were skeptical, but the team pushed ahead. By December 1943–after only 11 months–it produced the first Colossus machine. An even bigger version, using 2,400 tubes, was ready by June 1, 1944. The machines helped confirm that Hitler was unaware of the planned D-Day invasion. Turing’s need to hide both his homosexuality and his codebreaking work meant that he often found himself playing his own imitation game, pretending to be things he wasn’t. At one point he proposed marriage to a female colleague (played by Keira Knightley in the new film), but then felt compelled to tell her that he was gay. She was still willing to marry him, but he believed that imitating a straight man would be a sham and decided not to proceed. After the war, Turing turned his attention to an issue that he had wrestled with since his boarding-school friend Christopher Morcom’s death: Did humans have “free will” and consciousness, perhaps even a soul, that made them fundamentally different from a programmed machine? By this time Turing had become skeptical. He was working on machines that could modify their own programs based on information they processed, and he came to believe that this type of machine learning could lead to artificial intelligence. In a 1950 paper, he began with a clear declaration: “I propose to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’ ” With a schoolboy’s sense of fun, he invented his “imitation game,” now generally known as the Turing test, to give empirical meaning to that question. Put a machine and a human in a room, he said, and send in written questions. If you can’t tell which answers are from the machine and which are from the human, then there is no meaningful reason to insist that the machine isn’t “thinking.” A sample interrogation, he wrote, might include the following: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A : Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: [Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer] 105621. Turing did something clever in this example. Careful scrutiny shows that the respondent, after 30 seconds, made a slight mistake in addition. (The correct answer is 105,721.) Is that evidence that the respondent was a human? Perhaps. But then again, maybe it was a machine cagily playing an imitation game. Many objections have been made to Turing’s proposed test. “Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain,” declared a famous brain surgeon, Sir Geoffrey Jefferson. Turing’s response seems somewhat flippant, but it was also subtle: “The comparison is perhaps a little bit unfair because a sonnet written by a machine will be better appreciated by another machine.” There was also the more fundamental objection that even if a machine’s answers were indistinguishable from a human’s, that did not mean it had consciousness and its own intentions, the way human minds do. When the human player of the Turing test uses words, he associates those words with real-world meanings, emotions, experiences, sensations and perceptions. Machines don’t. Without such connections, language is just a game divorced from meaning. This critique of the Turing test remains the most debated topic in cognitive science. Turing gave his own guess as to whether a computer might be able to win his imitation game. “I believe that in about 50 years’ time it will be possible to program computers … so well that an average interrogator will not have more than a 70% chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.” Fooling fewer than a third of interrogators for only five minutes is a pretty low bar. Still, it’s now been more than 60 years, and the machines that enter Turing-test contests are at best engaging in gimmicky conversational gambits. The latest claim for a machine having “passed” the test was especially lame: a Russian program pretended to be a 13-year-old from Ukraine who didn’t speak English well. Even so, it fooled barely a third of the questioners for five minutes, and no one would believe that the program was engaging in true thinking. A new breed of computer processors that mimic the neural networks in the human brain might mean that, in a few more years or decades, there may be machines that appear to learn and think like humans. These latest advances could possibly even lead to a singularity, a term that computer pioneer John von Neumann coined and the futurist Ray Kurzweil and the science-fiction writer Vernor Vinge popularized to describe the moment when computers are not only smarter than humans but also can design themselves to be even supersmarter and will thus no longer need us mortals. In the meantime, most of the exciting new inventions, like those in this issue, will involve watches, devices, social networks and other innovations that connect humans more closely to machines, in intimate partnership, rather than pursuing the mirage of machines that think on their own and try to replace us. The flesh-and-blood complexities of Alan Turing’s life, as well as the very human emotions that drove him, serve as a testament that the distinction between man and machine may be deeper than he surmised. In a 1952 BBC debate with Geoffrey Jefferson, the brain surgeon, this issue of human “appetites, desires, drives, instincts” came up. Man is prey to “sexual urges,” Jefferson repeatedly said, and “may make a fool of himself.” Turing, who was still discreet about his sexuality, kept silent when this topic arose. During the weeks leading up to the broadcast, he had been engaged in a series of actions that were so very human that a machine would have found them incomprehensible. He had recently finished a scientific paper, and he followed it by composing a short story, which was later found among his private papers, about how he planned to celebrate. “It was quite some time now since he had ‘had’ anyone, in fact not since he had met that soldier in Paris last summer,” he wrote. “Now that his paper was finished he might justifiably consider that he had earned another gay man, and he knew where he might find one who might be suitable.” On a street in Manchester, Turing picked up a 19-year-old working-class drifter named Arnold Murray, who moved in with him around the time of the BBC broadcast. When Turing’s home was burglarized, he reported the incident to the police and ended up disclosing his sexual relationship with Murray. Turing was arrested for “gross indecency.” At the trial in March 1952, Turing pleaded guilty, though he made it clear he felt no remorse. He was offered a choice: imprisonment or probation contingent on receiving hormone injections designed to curb his sexual desires, as if he were a chemically controlled machine. He chose the latter, which he endured for a year. Turing at first seemed to take it all in stride, but on June 7, 1954, at age 41, he committed suicide by biting into an apple he had laced with cyanide. He had always been fascinated by the scene in Snow White in which the Wicked Queen dips an apple into a poisonous brew. He was found in his bed with froth around his mouth, cyanide in his system and a half-eaten apple by his side. The imitation game was over. He was human.

The petition has triggered a huge debate. Those who have signed the petition note that developers of GPT-4 and other large language model AIs promise that their technology will change the course of civilization, but claims they have not taken appropriate steps to protect civilization from harm. They frame the future of AI in apocalyptic terms. Those who oppose the petition fall into two large buckets: those who are comfortable with the status quo of rapidly developing AI models and those who believe the petition sponsors are so focused on the future that they ignore widespread harms from existing applications of AI. The latter argument is particularly interesting, as the group includes leading technologists and scholars in the AI field, including Timnit Gebru, Emily Bender, and Margaret Mitchell. We really do need a different approach to AI, the first step of which is acknowledgement that AI is just the latest manifestation of the Silicon Valley hype machine. AI is just code where the benefits fall far short of what the promoters promise, with much more harm. We have seen this movie repeatedly (Facebook, TikTok, etc) over the last dozen years, always with unhappy endings. It is past time we do something about large scale technological changes being rapidly imposed on society. The question we should be asking about artificial intelligence – and every other new technology – is whether private corporations be allowed to run uncontrolled experiments on the entire population without any guardrails or safety nets. Should it be legal for corporations to release products to the masses before demonstrating that those products are safe? Read More: The Only Way to Deal With the Threat from AI  The tech industry has been running uncontrolled experiments for more than a decade, across a wide range of product categories, frequently with catastrophic results. In 2012, for example, Facebook ran an experiment in which they made 155,000 people sad, without their knowledge, must less permission. Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok were largely designed to create envy in teens, without consideration for psychological harms. Relatively limited applications of AI have already enabled civil rights violations in mortgage lending, resume review, and policing. With large language model AIs, the scale of the experiments has changed, increasing by two orders of magnitude or more relative to early AIs. Chat GPT, a large language model that reached one billion total users – and 100 million active users – only two months after its introduction, has been called a “bullshit generator.” When Microsoft incorporated Chat GPT into its Bing search engine, the large number of factual errors triggered a tsunami of criticism. Despite the flaws, the integration of Chat GPT caused Bing’s daily user count to pass 100 million for the first time. Thanks to tacit and explicit endorsements from media and policy makers, millions of people have bought into the hype, embracing another dangerous tech product. Even Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI, has expressed concern about the risk from the technology he is creating. But rather than taking action to protect consumers, Altman is developing larger models as fast as he can. Those who support the current approach to AI argue that we cannot afford to slow down because we are in a race with China. Really? How does flooding the information ecosystem with bad answers, disinformation, and civil rights violations help us compete with China? Historically, America is most successful when it focuses on its core values: democracy, the right of self-determination, creativity, and entrepreneurship. We win with jet aircraft, carbonated beverages (i.e. Coke), and entertainment. China’s wins when it can leverage its scale and authoritarian government. AIs based on high quality content, operated in a manner consistent with American values, would improve our competitiveness, but that is not the approach Silicon Valley is taking. They want to compete with China on China’s terms. That is crazy. The harms of poorly developed AI have been discussed in public policy circles since at least 2017, but Congress and two presidents have done nothing. I know because I have been one of the people raising the alarm. The problems with AI cannot be fixed with a six-month moratorium. What is required is a different approach to the development and deployment of new technologies, an approach that prioritizes protection of consumer safety, democracy, and other values over returns to shareholders. If we could wave a magic wand and change the culture of tech, there would be no need for a moratorium. And a moratorium without a clear path to better development practices accomplishes nothing. The industry has long treated self-regulation as license to do what it pleases. AI has huge promise, and the technology is advancing rapidly, but it can only be as good as the content used to train it. Engineers have the option of training AIs on content created by experts, but few choose that path, due to cost. Instead, they train their systems on data scraped for free from the web, sometimes in violation of copyright law. AI developers scrape content from high quality sites like Wikipedia, but much more comes from sites that do not distinguish between information and disinformation. If you train an AI on low quality content, the results will also be low quality. Given the scale of products like Chat GPT and GPT-4, there is a great risk of flooding the internet with disinformation. A Google engineer resigned after claiming that his company had trained its own large language model AI, Bard, on Chat GPT. So long as we build AIs on lousy content, the results are going to be lousy. AI will be right some of the time, but you won’t be able to tell if the answer is right or wrong without doing further research, which defeats the purpose. For most of the past forty years, government and the people have given tech companies nearly total freedom with respect to product development. Consumers have adopted new technologies more or less blindly, despite escalating harms over the past fourteen years. In today’s regulatory vacuum, the incentives in tech are to maximize shareholder value, even if doing so undermines core values like public safety and democracy. Laissez-faire policies have led to the creation of great wealth for a relative handful of entrepreneurs and investors, but at enormous cost to society as a whole. The window is closing to protect democracy and the public from increasingly harmful technology products and the culture that creates them. We cannot afford further inaction.

Both Microsoft and Apple have recently launched new tablets that they say are designed for productivity and creativity. The fifth-generation Surface Pro, launching on Thursday and starting at $799, is the company’s fastest model yet, with Microsoft claiming longer battery life, better performance, and more accurate stylus input. Apple unveiled a new iPad Pro just last week, which has an updated processor, a new size option, and improved screen technology. The 10.5-inch version starts at $649, while the 12.9-inch size begins at $799. Buy now: Microsoft Surface Pro, $799 and up, Best Buy | iPad Pro, $649 and up, Apple Both are powerful, portable, and expensive machines designed to fulfill similar roles, each excelling and falling short in their own ways. The iPad Pro functions better as a tablet overall, while the Surface Pro is more capable of replacing your PC. That’s largely because of the software powering these devices. The iPad Pro runs on iOS, which boasts a massive library of more than two million apps, many of which are optimized specifically for the iPad. You can feel comfortable knowing that when a popular app launches, there’s a good chance it will be available for the iPad and it’ll look good. Meanwhile, Microsoft has long been criticized for its smaller selection of apps, which is part of the reason its mobile platform never took off. Spotify and YouTube are two popular apps still missing from the Windows Store, for example. The desktop experience is where the Surface has a sizable lead over the iPad Pro. Yes, Apple is making an effort to turn the iPad into a better laptop replacement. When iOS 11 launches in the fall, the iPad will gain a dock that holds more apps, a redesigned app switcher, and a new file management app, all of which make it more like a “real” computer. Even before that update, the iPad Pro can display apps in a split screen view, minimize a video and play it in the corner so you can continue with other tasks, and pull up apps in a sidebar. But the Surface runs full-fledged Windows 10, making it better equipped for multitasking right out of the gate. That’s the biggest advantage the Surface has over the iPad. If you’ve been using Windows at all in the past few years, you already know how it works. Plus, you can use a mouse with the Surface Pro, which is tremendously helpful for precision. For getting serious work done, I prefer Microsoft’s Signature TypeCover ($159.99 for Signature, $129.99 for regular) over Apple’s Smart Keyboard ($169 for 12.9-inch, $159 for 10.5-inch). The TypeCover is more spacious, with plenty of room to rest your palms, a full row of function keys, and a sturdier design than in years past. It still doesn’t feel like a laptop keyboard when you’re using it in your lap rather than on a hard surface, but it’s enough to get the job done. The iPad’s keyboard cover is adequate if you’re taking a few notes or sending quick emails, but it’s too cramped to use for a full workday. Both Apple and Microsoft are marketing their tablets as ideal for creative professionals. With that in mind, both have engineered their own styluses for everything from taking notes to editing photos and sketching artwork. Both the Apple Pencil ($99) and Surface Pen ($59.99 for regular, $99.99 for Platinum) are responsive and fluid, but I prefer Microsoft’s for two reasons: it magnetically attaches to the Surface so it’s harder to lose, and it can simply do more than the Apple Pencil. Clicking the Surface Pen’s top button pulls up a side panel on the tablet with apps designed for stylus input, like Sticky Notes and Sketchpad, as well as suggested apps. The Apple Pencil works well but doesn’t provide any additional functionality, and there’s nowhere to store it. The Surface Pro has another design advantage over the iPad Pro, too: The kickstand. It makes it possible to adjust the viewing angles to your liking and prop up the Surface on a table or desk even when it’s not connected to its keyboard case. The kickstand on the newest model is even more flexible, allowing the Surface to lie nearly flat against a table similar to a drafting board. In terms of hardware, both the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are equipped with gorgeous screens, zippy processors, and pretty good battery life. But there are some important differences. Although the Surface Pro’s screen (12.3-inches with a resolution of 2,736 by 1,824) and the 10.5-inch iPad Pro’s display (2,224 by 1,668 resolution) both looked sharp and colorful when streaming video side-by-side, the iPad was better suited for reading. This is mostly thanks to Apple’s TrueTone technology, which softened the blue light coming from the screen to feel easier on the eyes. Scrolling is also smoother on Apple’s tablet, although the difference is only noticeable when quickly flipping through content. But Microsoft gives buyers more options when it comes to processing power. Surface shoppers can customize their machine with a lower-powered Intel m3 or desktop-class Core i5 or Core i7, all of which are new seventh-generation processors. Microsoft also offers up to 1TB of storage space, while all iPad Pro models run on Apple’s A10X Fusion chip and have a maximum of 512GB of storage space. Still, both machines offer speedy and smooth performance and can multitask with ease. On both the iPad Pro and Surface Pro, I worked on spreadsheets, wrote articles, opened nearly 20 tabs in Google Chrome, played games with heavy graphics, and streamed video without any stutters. The Surface Pro scored slightly higher in performance tests designed to measure speed when it comes to running apps and processing images, but not by much. However, I did notice that Microsoft’s tablet began to feel warm to the touch while it ran a full system virus scan in the background of those tasks. Because I chose to use Google Chrome during the course of this test, which gobbled up 80% of my battery usage, the Surface Pro’s didn’t last quite as long as I had expected. I got about six hours out of the device, which might not be enough to get through a full workday without plugging in. If you don’t mind primarily using Microsoft’s Edge browser, you’ll likely get much more mileage out of the device. But the iPad still lasted longer: After using a mix of Chrome and Safari, I only burned through a quarter of the battery after three and a half hours. If you’re trying to decide whether a Surface Pro or iPad Pro is right for you, the answer largely depends on your preferences and how you plan to use it. The iPad Pro has a better selection of polished apps, is lighter and more portable, and is better for reading. In my experience, it’s plenty powerful enough to keep up with devices running on the latest Intel processors. But the software just isn’t there yet if you often plan to use it as a laptop replacement. The Surface Pro’s Windows 10 support, integrated kickstand, and superior accessories make it better at functioning as a work computer, but its app selection needs work. Think of it this way: The iPad Pro is the device I’d choose to take on a long car ride, especially if I want to catch up on a lot of work-related reading, fire off some emails, and squeeze in some gaming. The Surface Pro is the computer I’d toss in my bag on the way to a conference to publish stories or bring a meeting to manage notes.

Contrast that with Microsoft, whose Windows 10 software now runs across all manner of devices, from desktop computers to funky 2-in-1 hybrids. But ever since it launched the gargantuan 12.9-inch iPad Pro in 2015, Apple has shown signs it’s willing to somewhat rethink that strategy. With the launch of its new iPad Pro, Apple has a tablet that’s more likely than ever to replace some of the functions of your laptop. Thanks to improved specs, a reworked form factor, and new software launching later this year, this is an iPad that’s more capable than its predecessors. The new iPad Pro models have a faster processor, a more responsive and brighter, more colorful screen with a higher refresh rate than their predecessors. The camera is taken straight from the iPhone 7. And the new iOS 11 software, which will be available in the fall, adds useful new multitasking features that mimic working on a “real” computer. After spending several days using the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, which starts at $649 and begins shipping this week, I’m convinced this is the best tablet for productivity Apple has made so far. I appreciated the speed and power that came in the original 12.9-inch model, but it was way too cumbersome to use with one hand or stash in my bag. For those reasons, I was willing to sacrifice that extra screen space for the portability that the 9.7-inch version offered. But the new 10.5-inch Pro provides the perfect middle ground. The difference between 9.7 inches and 10.5 inches doesn’t sound like much on paper, but it goes a long way in practice. The new iPad Pro’s screen is about 20% larger than the last, while the tablet itself is only slightly bigger. Apple achieved this by reducing the size of the borders around the display, a tactic companies like Samsung and LG have used to offer more spacious screens on their latest smartphones without making their devices bulkier. Read more: The 6 Biggest Things Apple Announced at WWDC The design tweak is a much-needed change that not only makes web browsing and multitasking more enjoyable, but also gives the iPad a more sleek and modern look. Viewing apps in split-screen mode is also more comfortable on a 10.5-inch screen, as the extra surface area makes it easier to read text in apps that only occupy half of the screen. The zippier A10X Fusion chip inside the new iPad Pro came to life during processor-intensive tasks like editing photos and using Touch ID. The 10.5-inch Pro smoked the 9.7 model when applying special effects to photos through the app Prisma, for example, and its fingerprint sensor was more responsive when unlocking the tablet. But don’t expect to see dramatic changes in speed with simple tasks like launching apps, taking notes, and managing email. The screen’s higher refresh rate, which is now at 120GHz, subtly improves the overall iPad experience. Jumping between home screens to browse through my apps only required a swipe so slight it felt like little more than a tap, showing virtually no latency. Apple also says the new iPad Pro automatically adjusts its refresh rate depending on the task at hand to avoid depleting the tablet’s battery too quickly. Read more: Can Apple Make You Want An iPad Again? Speaking of battery life, Apple is claiming about 10 hours here, which was about right based on my testing. After using the new Pro for a bit over three and a half hours, I had about 75% of battery remaining, which means it should be capable of breezing past 10 hours of usage. That number will vary depending on how you use the Pro. I mostly used it for writing this review, playing games, watching Netflix, and doing some light photo editing. If you’re exporting 4K video or cranking up the screen brightness, you’ll probably see the battery drain more quickly. Still, as impressive as the new iPad Pro’s hardware may be, many of the tablet’s improvements lie on the software side. The upcoming version of Apple’s iPhone and iPad software, iOS 11, adds features like multitasking improvements, a bigger dock for pinning apps, and a file management system. But iOS 11 will also be available for older and less expensive iPads, making it tough to justify the cost of the new iPad Pro unless you truly need the horsepower it provides. Additionally, Microsoft’s pricier Surface Pro and other Windows 10 tablets still offer some advantages over Apple’s high-end tablet, like more ports for accessories and hardware customization options — and they work with mice, making them feel even more like actual computers. But if you’re committed to Apple, and you’re looking for a tablet that can replace your MacBook for certain uses, the new iPad Pro can do the job. Between its high-performance new tablets and the multitasking-focused iOS 11, it’s clear that Apple is finally serious about making the iPad a viable PC alternative. Now it just has to execute on that vision. 4 out of 5 stars. Buy now: iPad Pro, $649 and up, Apple (Read TIME’s affiliate link policy.)

{"type": "article", "header": "How Your USB Cables Are About to Change Forever", "author": "John Patrick Pullen", "update_date/publish_date": "March 17, 2015 6:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/3745070/usb-c-macbook/", "text": "Announced earlier this week, Apple’s amazingly thin, new Macbook has made a lot of noise. And perhaps the loudest sounds were the groans over the two-pound notebook’s singular port, which supplies all the power and peripheral connectivity that the 12-inch laptop requires. But looking beyond the lack of outlets, the new USB-C port itself reveals a major revolution in the future of computing and power. “USB technology has really evolved into a single source that can deliver audio and video as well as data and power, all simultaneously, over a single cable and connector,” says Jeff Ravencraft, president of the USB Implementer’s Forum, a non-profit group of more than 700 member companies that are responsible for the advancing USB technology. When the new USB-C port was being dreamt up, engineers focused on three fundamental features: performance, power, and convenience. From a data performance perspective, USB-C has the potential to one day deliver up to 20 gigabits per second — but for now, it’s just 10 gigabits per second. (USB 3.1, USB-C’s predecessor, can also push through 10 gigabits per second, but the smaller Micro-B connector found on many smartphones can only handle half as much.) As for power, the new, smaller connector can pack up to 100 watts. In comparison, Apple’s Lightning cable currently charges iPads and iPhones with a 12 watt charger, and the Macbook Pro MagSafe power adapter pulls 85 watts from wall outlets. The convenience aspect of USB-C is that it’s the first truly reversible USB cable, which means, similar to Apple’s Lightning cable, either side can face up. Since the original release of USB, people have complained about its one-side-up nature, a confounding characteristic that defied the law of averages. While in theory, 50% of the time you should be inserting a USB cable into a port correctly, it seems like 100% of the time you had the damned thing upside down. So, figured computer makers, the best way to fix this problem was to finally make a “universal” USB cable. (Note: USB has always stood for “universal serial bus.”) Unfortunately, USB-C will take that hoard of USB cables you’ve painstakingly collected throughout the years and render them obsolete. On the one hand, once your gadgets all roll over — every keyboard, USB-charging Bluetooth speaker, fitness band, and USB-to-AC power plug — you’ll never have to hunt for a mini-USB cable (or was it micro-USB?) again. Instead, there will only be one cord to rule them all. (But never mind the billions of existing USB devices already out in the wild which, until they go away, will command a vast legion of adapters.) The Macbook’s early adoption of USB-C may seem like the typical Apple bleeding edge move, but it’s actually a refreshing show of support for an open standard the likes of which the company doesn’t typically undertake. While it was the first computer company to put Wi-Fi into its computers, Apple also developed its own proprietary 30-pin Dock connector, Thunderbolt, and Lightning cables, which have largely appeared exclusively on Apple devices. Due in part to the environmental wastefulness of these many different cables, proprietary connectors were outlawed by the European Union, which has mandated that cellphone manufacturers adopt the MicroUSB plug. But USB-C is designed to replace that cord, too. And it’s important to have the support of Apple, because the bi-directional cable will eventually replace pretty much every cord ever. That’s because USB-C isn’t just a data or power cable — it has the ability to work in “alternate modes,” too. For example, there are already efforts afoot to make the new cord work like a DisplayPort or MHL cable, carrying video signals from a computer to a display. In order for one of the new MacBooks to do that today, it would need a cable with USB-C on one end and one of those other plugs on the other. But eventually, in the not-too-distant future, monitors, hard drives, mice, keyboards — basically any computer-related product with a plug — will have a USB-C port instead of an HDMI, MiniDisplay, Firewire or any other kind of outlet. “This is the fastest transition that we’ve ever experienced with USB, and I’ve been working on USB for 15 years,” says Ravencraft. After Apple’s announcement early last week, Google also announced support for USB-C, with its new Chromebook Pixel sporting the port, and upcoming Android phones are likely to have it too. The goal is to bring a single cable to the masses that’s small enough, physically robust enough, and powerful enough to be the standard for the next 20 years—so we won’t have to do this again for a long time. It will be the only cable we need — except, of course, for Lightning cables, because you know Apple’s not giving up on those things any time soon.

Tablet? Tricked-out laptop? Nitrogen-cooled desktop? Suitcase nuclear reactor? Here’s what VR’s prime players have divulged so far. I’ve limited the list to the folks making headsets that plug into computers or game consoles, not the lower-end, frankly not all that interesting rash of cheap goggles you can slip a smartphone into. The most recognizable virtual reality headset — partly because it caught the media’s eye when Doom creator John Carmack got involved, partly because Facebook made it impossible for the world not to notice when it shoveled out $2 billion to buy parent Oculus VR. The Oculus Rift is VR’s bellwether: how well (or poorly) it does will indelibly shape the dialogue we’ll be having about virtual reality for years to come. Oculus just put the Rift up for pre-order Wednesday morning. It’ll set you back a cool $600 (that includes the headset, sensor, remote, cables, Xbox One gamepad and two games) and ships in “March 2016.” Here’s the sort of PC the company says you’ll need to have, minimally, for “the full Rift experience.” Graphics chipset / video card NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD 290 equivalent or greater CPU Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater Memory 8GB (or more) of RAM Video Output Compatible HDMI 1.3 video output USB Ports 3x USB 3.0 ports plus 1x USB 2.0 port Operating System Windows 7 SP1 64 bit or newer For a prebuilt PC, you’re looking at $900 to $1,000. The cost is possibly lower if you build one yourself. So with the Rift, your total outlay is going to be in the vicinity of $1,600. Sony’s PlayStation VR headset (once “Project Morpheus”) couldn’t be simpler: it needs a PlayStation 4. That’s it. So if you already own one, you’re set. Sony is doubtless banking on the fact that (A) nearly 36 million people worldwide already have PlayStation 4 systems, and (B) early VR adoption will be driven by gaming enthusiasts. That’s the PlayStation 4’s core demographic. We still don’t know how much PlayStation VR headset’s going to cost. Sony has said it’ll run as much as a new gaming platform. That probably means $300 to $400, putting the full package in the $700 to $800 range. Sony’s said it hopes to ship PlayStation VR sometime during the first half of 2016. HTC Vive is the only one of the bunch without recommended specifications. But HTC and Valve’s virtual reality headset is similar to the Oculus Rift, thus my guesstimate–since like the Rift, it’s a PC-driven experience–that it’ll wind up with similar PC specs and pricing (that is, $1,500-ish all in). What we do know is what it’ll take to run space sim Elite: Dangerous on the HTC Vive. Here’s what studio Frontier Developments currently lists: Graphics chipset / video card Nvidia GTX 980 with 4GB or better CPU Intel Core i7-3770K Quad Core CPU or better / AMD FX 4350 Quad Core CPU or better Memory 16 GB RAM Hard Drive 8 GB available space Operating System Windows 7/8/10 64-bit At this point, the consumer version of the HTC Vive is due sometime in April 2016. Before you go, it’s worth noting that graphics processing company Nvidia issued a kind of warning earlier this week, claiming that virtual reality games require seven times the power of a “normal” game. Bear in mind Nvidia wants people to sell you GPUs, so waiting for reviews and performance benchmarks is essential to vet that claim. But if it’s not scaremongering and you’re hoping to skate by with something less than a GTX 970 or AMD 290, brace for further VR sticker shock.

The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and Calico (focused on longevity). Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related. Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. We’ll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we’ll determine their compensation. In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole.

The newest wave in computer technology, consumer virtual reality devices are expected to wash ashore in 2016. So now is a great time to get familiar with the lay of the impending virtual land. In wrapping your brain around virtual reality, it’s important to understand that not all wearable screen technologies are created equally — nor are they all designed to do the same thing. As a result, the wearable screen landscape is evolving into three distinct domains: augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and virtual reality (VR). Virtual reality serves as a sort of umbrella term for the space, simply because it was coined first (in 1987, by computer scientist Jaron Lanier). But once all the impending products start rolling out, VR may prove to be the least popular of the three distinct technologies. Here’s why. Augmented Reality Is Already Here “[Augmented Reality] is a digital overlay on top of your real environment,” says Andy Fouché, the head of public relations and government affairs for Magic Leap, one of many wearable display companies set to make a big splash. Essentially, AR inserts a digital element into the users’ worlds, but only blocks off part of that world. For many people, that description of AR brings Google Glass to mind. A pair of experimental glasses with a tiny, embedded display, Google Glass augmented reality by displaying everything from calendar and email notifications to turn-by-turn directions and travel alerts, right over the wearer’s field of vision. But even if you weren’t among the few who got a Google Glass headset, you’ve still likely been walking around with AR technology in your pocket for the past eight years. Apps with overlay information like Star Walk, an iOS app that can identify constellations by pointing the iPhone’s camera toward the stars, and iOnRoad, a heads-up-display driving app, have turned smartphones into augmented reality devices, simply by using the handhelds’ sensors. These added layers of helpful information is what AR is really all about. Experts believe that AR will emerge to be a great tool in the workplace. Run by lightweight applications, AR could help guide factory workers in manufacturing products, present scenarios for people undergoing training, or serve as GPS-enabled displays for delivery drivers and other workers.  Mixed Reality: The Emerging Space While pocket-sized applications of AR are easy to carry around, they’re not the most convenient to use — you almost always have to be holding your handset to see the effect. In addition, AR systems typically don’t have a lot of computing power driving them. On the other hand, VR can be the opposite: Wearing the device on your face blocks out the world around you, and they can require some high-powered (and heavy) gear to make the experience fully immersive. Mixed Reality is the emerging technology that’s aiming to fill the gap in between. “Mixed Reality is digital content integrated into your real world, capable of interacting with you and your environment,” says Fouché. This unique experience enables a person to choose the degree of digital reality the wearer desires, he says. For instance, at one moment she can experience her entire world digitally, like how VR operates, while the next she can experience a seamless mix of the digital and real worlds, similar to AR. The difference is that MR is enabled by powerful computers loaded with sensors designed specifically to generate convincing visuals that can interact with the real world around you. Magic Leap is playing its cards close to the vest, showing only concepts of its product’s uses without revealing details about the hardware itself. Microsoft HoloLens, on the other hand, is taking a markedly different approach, showing the world what’s up its sleeve before the company releases its mixed reality product in early 2016. Microsoft is billing the HoloLens as more of a productivity tool than anything else. For instance, the company has revealed how it has teamed up with NASA to give scientists the means to virtually walk on the surface of Mars using imagery from the Curiosity rover. On Earth — specifically at Case Western Reserve University — the school has collaborated with both the Cleveland Clinic and Microsoft to show students thousands of hearts constructed from MRI imagery, a revolutionary way to learn human anatomy, and all its intricacies. And of course you can play Minecraft on the thing, because why not? These are just a few uses for MR, a field that’s set to boom in the very near future. Virtual Reality: Now Showing Virtual Reality is nothing new, but through the miniaturization of technology and the improvement in display resolution, it’s become more prevalent in recent years. Experts have argued that the immersive technology stretches back at least as far as the initial release of the View-Master, the beloved childhood toy, which is more than 75 years old. But now through headsets like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard, people have been able to use their smartphones as VR screens. Heck, even toy maker Mattel is getting in on the action, relaunching View-Master as a smartphone-powered VR headset. However, the definition of VR is a sticky one. While many digital products bill themselves as VR, technically, they aren’t. “VR is a totally occluded experience,” says Fouché. In other words, he says, it’s “completely closed off from your natural world.” So, it should be a different reality that you can see, hear, and interact with. But most VR experiences being shown through these smartphone setups aren’t at all interactive. Instead, they are actually just immersive video. For instance, the New York Times recently released an immersive documentary called The Displaced, which let viewers explore the environments of three children living in war-torn worlds. True VR would have let the user interact with the environment or the films’ subjects. Likewise, last month’s Democratic debate was broadcast in VR. The real world event took place in Las Vegas, but Samsung VR owners could watch the immersive feed — though not interact with the participants (thank goodness) — from their living rooms. “The graphics were so poor they looked more like faceless avatars than human beings,” wrote TIME’s Alex Fitzpatrick. In fairness to the programmers behind this effort, come election season, most politicians look like faceless avatars. But just because some VR isn’t as high-powered doesn’t mean it will lose the big technology race. Facebook has also invested heavily in VR. The social network’s aim has always been to connect the world, and with its immersive videos, it’s doing just that. In 2014, the company bought Oculus, a startup creating a wearable VR headset, for $2 billion. And the Oculus Rift headset is due to launch in early 2016. Early buzz for the product is the same as its competition: It’s a head-turner.

But creating an immersive audio experience is just as necessary to make a virtual reality environment feel realistic. Now, Google is helping developers do just that. The company recently announced that the software development kit for its Cardboard headset will now support spacial audio. Translation: audio in VR will behave more like the sounds we hear in our everyday lives. Google likens this effect to the way sound changes when a firetruck zooms by or when an airplane is heard passing overhead. Support for spacial audio is coming to Android and Unity, a development platform that’s used to build high-end mobile games. Developed by multiple brands Buy here Part Segway, part skateboard, the self-balancing scooter—generally known as a hoverboard, even though it doesn’t actually hover—is easily the year’s most viral product, drawing fans like Justin Bieber, Jimmy Fallon and Kendall Jenner. Once someone hops on, the device uses a pair of electric gyroscopes (one under each pad) to balance automatically, allowing users to speed forward, backward and around by slightly shifting their body weight. That enables all kinds of fun stunts, ranging from hallway races to motorized dance routines. Maxx Yellin, co-founder of PhunkeeDuck, one of more than 20 companies making versions of the device, sees larger implications. “It could evolve as a new form of transportation for cities and colleges,” Yellin says (though British authorities recently caused a stir by outlawing their use on public sidewalks and streets). But convenience comes at a cost: prices range from $350 to $1,700, depending on the brand and its features. —Lisa Eadicicco   The Lowline Lab Developed by Dan Barasch and James Ramsey “It’s not like any park you’ve ever seen before,” says Dan Barasch of the Lowline, an abandoned trolley terminal in New York City’s Lower East Side that he and architect James Ramsey are trying to turn into an acre of lush green space, replete with flowering plants and areas to relax in the sun. The key: a “remote skylight” dish system that captures sunlight from surrounding rooftops and funnels it underground via fiber-optic cable; once there, it’s beamed out via reflective dome, enabling plants to grow. To prove the technology works, Barasch and Ramsey opened the Lowline Lab; it’s a prototype version of the final park, which is still several approvals—and $70 million in funding—away from completion. But Barasch, who attracted more than 3,300 backers on Kickstarter, is undeterred. Even forgotten places, he says, can still be used “for public good.” —Julie Shapiro 6SensorLabs’ Nima / $199 Available for preorder at NimaSensor.com For the millions of Americans with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, eating out is often anxiety-ridden—any menu item might contain traces of the protein, which is off-limits. The Nima sensor, which starts shipping early next year, would work to put their minds at ease by allowing them to test any kind of food or drink in as little as two minutes. After a sample is dropped into the well of the device, a proprietary antibody (loaded in a disposable cartridge) mines it for traces of gluten. If they exist, a frowning face lights up; if not, a smile appears. “My hope is that people are going to be able to eat socially” without accidentally getting sick, says Shireen Yates, a 6SensorLabs co-founder who is gluten-sensitive. The firm also hopes to apply its technology to detect other food allergens, including peanuts and dairy. —Alice Park Doppler Labs Here Active Listening Earbuds / $249 Waitlist open at Hereplus.me If you’re stuck somewhere with unbearable noise, you essentially have two options: plug your ears, or leave. But what if you could isolate the most grating sound and mute it? Or just lower the volume, much as you would on a TV? That’s the promise of the Here Active Listening system, a groundbreaking set of earbuds from New York–based Doppler Labs. Unlike hearing aids, which amplify or decrease all noises at once, Here’s processor syncs with a smartphone app, so users can handpick which frequencies they want to filter. That means you could stand on a subway platform and have a normal conversation as a train screeches by, or even tune out a crying baby on a plane. “It’s augmented audio reality,” says Doppler Labs CEO Noah Kraft, who initially developed Here for musicians and concertgoers before pivoting to a general audience. The first earbuds will ship in December. —Alex Fitzpatrick Eko Core (buy here) Developed by Connor Landgraf, Jason Bellet and Tyler Crouch If there is one aspect of medicine that’s more art than science, it’s the way doctors listen to ­heartbeats—­trusting their fallible ears and memory to detect aberrations over time. Not so with Eko Core. Once the $199 smart adapter is attached to a stethoscope, it streams heartbeat data to the cloud so physicians can download it to a smartphone. From there, a companion app can analyze the audio and compare it to previous recordings, which may help doctors detect murmurs, heart-valve abnormalities and other conditions that “our ears are not able to,” says Dr. John Chorba, a cardiologist (and mentor to one of the inventors) who’s leading an Eko trial at the University of California, San Francisco. If the device works as planned—early signs are positive—it could not only improve overall care but also drastically reduce the need for expensive tests like echocardiograms. —Alice Park Microsoft HoloLens Buy here Virtual-reality headsets, like the Oculus Rift, create escapes. Put one on, and you’re suddenly swimming with dolphins or fighting in the Battle of Waterloo. Microsoft’s HoloLens, by contrast, augments reality—overlaying holograms and data onto existing surroundings, so you’re not “confined to the virtual world,” as designer Alex Kipman puts it. Imagine gamers defending their homes from robot invaders, engineers manipulating 3-D models or surgeons following directions “on” the human body. Early tests indicate all are possible. Already the HoloLens is being used by NASA to mimic Mars’ terrain in labs and by medical students to dissect virtual bodies. —Alex Fitzpatrick Banza Chickpea Pasta / $4+ per 8 oz. box Buy here  “When people think of pasta, they almost always think, I ate way too much and now I feel like crap,” says Brian Rudolph. Not so with his brand, which is made from chickpeas instead of wheat. That simple switch—in a recipe perfected over 10 months of trial and error—has yielded a healthy twist on the al dente dinner. Banza, shorthand for garbanzo pasta, has double the protein and four times the fiber of traditional pasta, and far fewer carbs; it’s also gluten-free. And to those who may question how good it tastes, consider the sales. Banza launched in two U.S. stores last year; now it’s in 1,700, including Fairway markets, where it was recently the top-­selling pasta of any kind (including wheat). Now Rudolph and his brother Scott plan to reinvent products like pizza and cereal. “People want to eat better,” he says. “We see Banza as a true replacement, a more filling version of the food people love.” —Mandy Oaklander Juno Developed by Fluidigm It can take a full day to “amplify” DNA, the technical term for making millions of copies of one strain so it can be compared with many others. Juno cuts that process to just three hours, freeing scientists to concentrate on actual ­analysis—a shift that makes it easier to match bone-marrow donors, find cures for genetic diseases and more. The key is Fluidigm’s proprietary microchip, which can amplify samples that are 1,000 times smaller than a drop of water. And the sleek, Yves Béhar–­designed aesthetic doesn’t hurt, either. “We see a lot of possibilities for clinical labs and hospitals,” says Marc Unger, a senior vice president at Fluidigm, of the $120,000 machine, which is now being used at academic and research labs. “We really want to help.” —Alexandra Sifferlin Star Apartments Designed by Michael Maltzan For decades, housing for the homeless has too often meant transient shelters or warehouse-­like abodes. L.A.’s Star Apartments aims to buck that trend by design; it functions more like a minivillage than a single building, says Maltzan of his third collaboration with Skid Row Housing Trust, a local nonprofit. In addition to 102 prefabricated studios, which are ingeniously staggered into four terraced stories, Star Apartments offers a ground-floor medical clinic and, above that, a garden, an outdoor running track and space for classrooms. The goal, says Maltzan, is to make the residents of its 300-sq.-ft. units—who are handpicked by the county department of health ­services—feel “like they’re part of a dynamic and intimate community,” a strategy that can help people, especially those struggling with homelessness and substance-­abuse issues, re-­establish stability in their lives. —Richard Lacayo Safety Truck Developed by Samsung and Leo Burnett Every year, thousands of people get hurt or die in traffic accidents, in part because their visibility gets blocked by a lumbering vehicle. This is especially true in Argentina, known for its winding, narrow roads. There, however, Samsung and ad agency Leo Burnett have partnered on a creative solution: a system that relays video footage from the front of a truck to four screens on its back, giving drivers a clear view of what’s ahead. During its initial test, the Safety Truck covered some 620 miles (1,000 km) over three days without incident. Now Samsung is refining the technology and working with Argentine officials to roll it out more broadly. “We believe this will change the history of road safety,” says Sang Jik Lee, president of Samsung Electronics Argentina. —Julie Shapiro Sproutling / $299 Available for preorder at Sproutling.com “Is my baby O.K.?” That’s the question Sproutling aims to answer—in real time—with its first product. Once in place, the Fitbit-like device can track an infant’s heart rate, body temperature, position and more, and notify parents, via mobile app, if there’s cause for alarm. (Though regular check-ins are still encouraged.) Once it learns a baby’s habits, Sproutling can also offer helpful predictions, like when he or she will wake up from a nap. “We want to get more understanding of how children behave as a whole,” says CEO Chris Bruce, a father of two. “That’s the holy grail.” —Sarah Begley Drone Port Developed by Foster + Partners and Afrotech-EPFL As Amazon, Google and others ramp up their drone-delivery tests, one question looms large: How will their home base function? For hints, the tech titans may well look to Rwanda, where workers will soon break ground on three “drone ports,” designed to make it easier to transport food, medical supplies, electronics, spare parts and other goods through the hilly countryside, where road travel is difficult. The Rwanda project “is a relatively modest beginning,” says Norman Foster, chairman of architecture firm Foster + Partners, which is leading the first phase of construction (scheduled to be completed in 2020). But, he adds, “it could be a catalyst,” helping to solve an array of pressing health issues and creating a model for other countries looking to regulate commercial drone use. —Sarah Begley Thinx / $24+ per pair Available at Shethinx.com For decades, women trying to avoid leaks or stains during menstruation have mainly had to rely on disposable pads, tampons and panty liners, which can be bulky and expensive. “But can’t underwear do the same thing, better?” wondered Miki and Radha Agrawal. That’s the idea behind Thinx, a line of thongs and panties that the twin sisters—alongside co-founder Antonia Dunbar and a team of manufacturers in Sri Lanka—have engineered to (mostly) replace traditional products. Each pair is washable, reusable and equipped with four layers of moisture-wicking, antimicrobial fabric. On heavier days, however, some women may need extra protection. “We always say, Know your flow,” says Miki. —Samantha Grossman Casper Mattress / $500+ Available at Casper.com Buying a new mattress is a lot like purchasing a used car: stressful, confusing and likely to overwhelm you with options. “We want to cut the clutter,” says Philip Krim, CEO of Casper, one of many startups upending the sleep industry, including Leesa and Tuft & Needle. The model is simple: create one mattress style; up the comfort factor (using a mix of foams); set clear prices; and sell it online (cutting costs, so prices remain low). Once the mattress arrives—it’s vacuum-packed in a cardboard box—customers get a 100-day trial period during which they can return it for a full refund. But that rarely happens, says Krim. Casper’s sales are expected to exceed $75 million this year, making it a leader among its startup competitors. —Victor Luckerson Apple Pencil and iPad Pro / $99 and $799+, respectively Buy here  In the 450 years or so since its invention, the pencil has become so ubiquitous, it’s easy to forget how remarkable a technology it is. It can write at any angle. Shades get darker depending on how hard you press. Marks can be erased. Reproducing this functionality digitally has vexed computer engineers for years, which is what makes Apple’s latest effort so impressive. The Pencil allows users to draw, paint or write on a screen, just as they would a sheet of paper. And it works in tandem with the iPad Pro, a tablet faster than roughly 80% of laptops sold in the past year, so there’s no perceptible delay. That combination has already sparked chatter about new ways to create art, animations, blueprints and more. “You can rest your hand anywhere and [the iPad Pro screen] totally ignores it and it just reads the Pencil,” wrote Don Shank, an art director at Pixar, after testing the products in September. “It’s pretty amazing.” —Matt Vella Nike Flyease 8 / $130 Available at Nike.com In 2012, Matthew Walzer, a then high school junior with cerebral palsy, sent a note to Nike: “My dream is to go to the college of my choice,” he wrote, “without having to worry about someone coming to tie my shoes every day.” Sensing an opportunity to create a new footwear category—both for casual consumers who want a simpler way to tie sneakers and for people like Walzer, who need one—Nike dispatched a design team. This year, they unveiled their solution: the Flyease 8, a LeBron James–branded basketball shoe with a one-handed fastening mechanism that drew inspiration from “opening and closing a door,” says Tobie Hatfield, the shoe’s head designer. (To tie the shoe, wearers yank on a strap, which zips around the ankle as they pull.) There are still kinks to work out; pulling the strap too hard or too fast, for example, may cause the zipper to break. But Walzer, now a sophomore at Florida Gulf Coast University, has said the shoes have given him a great “sense of independence and accomplishment.” —Sean Gregory Pantelligent / $199 Available at Pantelligent.com How hot should the pan be? When do I stir? It it done yet? If you’ve ever cooked an unfamiliar dish, chances are you’ve asked yourself one or more of these questions—­and ­Pantelligent aims to answer them all. Once you select a recipe from its smartphone app, the pan uses Bluetooth and a special heat sensor to offer real-time instructions on your screen, so you’ll know exactly when to flip a steak, for example, if you want it medium rare. When they first dreamed up the concept at MIT, Humberto Evans was a great cook, but Mike Robbins could barely fry an egg. Now, according to Evans, his former roommate whips up dishes like chicken piccata. “The food speaks for itself,” he says of how people can use the pans, which started shipping in October. —Samantha Grossman The Drinkable Book Developed by Teri Dankovich An estimated 663 million people globally do not have access to clean drinking water, in part because filtration is complicated and expensive. The Drinkable Book is neither: thanks to a special ­treatment—­developed with a team of scientists over several years—its pages double as water filters, killing over 99% of harmful bacteria during trials in Bangladesh, Ghana and South Africa. (They also list usage instructions.) Though research is still needed to determine whether the system can filter all contaminants, including viruses, Dankovich is optimistic; she says she is talking to partners who could help fund more testing and, eventually, large-scale production. —Sarah Begley The Ocean Cleanup Project Developed by Boyan Slat There’s a glut of plastic trash in the middle of the Pacific Ocean that’s bigger than Texas—and growing. But the default removal process of chasing it with nets is both costly and time-­consuming. Instead, the Ocean Cleanup Project proposes a 62-mile-long (100 km) floating boom—at an estimated cost of $15 million—that would use natural currents to trap trash. (Its net drops roughly 10 ft., or 3 m, below the surface, shallow enough for fish to swim around.) If next year’s trials succeed, a full cleanup operation would aim to start in 2020; internal estimates suggest it could reduce the trash by 42% over 10 years. —Bryan Walsh TZOA Environmental Tracker / $139 Available for preorder at Tzoa.com In order to avoid potentially harmful pollutants and allergens, it helps to know about the air you’re breathing. That’s where Tzoa comes in. The stationary device, developed by electrician Kevin R. Hart, uses sensors to evaluate the atmosphere in any given area—­measuring factors like temperature, particulate matter (dust, pollen, mold, car exhaust) and UV ­exposure—and uploads that data to the cloud, so that institutions like Johns Hopkins can conduct air-­quality research. The company plans to launch wearable versions in May that offer a similar service, allowing consumers to chart specific walking routes, for example, if they want to avoid pockets of pollen. —Alexandra Sifferlin Hackaball / $85 Available for preorder at Hackaball.com At a time when demand for computer scientists is skyrocketing, most Americans get little or no exposure to coding during their formative years. Made by Many, a New York City–based digital-­consulting firm, is trying to change that. Its Hackaball toy syncs with a mobile app, allowing users to program how and when it lights up—and then to see how those programs affect their lives in the real world. During one test, for example, kids set the ball to change colors at random intervals, then used it to play a hot-potato-style game. Enabling social ­scenarios—rather than a more isolated, screen-based introduction to ­coding—is the point of Hackaball, says William Owen, a strategy director at Made by Many. Its concept appears to be resonating: some 2,800 people backed the project on Kickstarter, raising $240,000. The first units ship in January. —Lisa Eadicicco Google Cardboard / Price varies Available DIY or from third-party sellers  Most of the hype surrounding virtual reality has rightly centered on premium headsets, such as the forthcoming Oculus Rift and HTC Vive (both of which will likely cost several hundred dollars). But Google Cardboard is revolutionary in its own right. Since its 2014 debut, the scrappy viewer—which can be built from scratch using free online instructions and relies on your smartphone screen for visuals—has emerged as a playground for virtual reality, priming brands and consumers alike for one of the world’s most anticipated technologies. There are Cardboard apps that let people drive cars (from Mercedes-Benz), attend concerts (from musician Jack White) and even play immersive video games. “We ask people, ‘Hey, put your smartphone in this piece of cardboard. It’s going to do something amazing,’” says Clay Bavor, a Google VP who oversees VR projects. “And then it does, and they’re shocked.” —Alex Fitzpatrick   Artiphon Instrument 1 / $399 Available for preorder at Artiphon.com An estimated 70% of adults want to play an instrument on a regular basis, but only 5% actually do, partly because it’s tough to choose just one to master. That’s not an issue with the Artiphon, which can mimic dozens of ­instruments—not just how they sound but also how they’re played. It can be strummed like a guitar or tapped like a piano. Or it can mix and match inputs, allowing users to bang banjo chords as if they were drumming. “We’re trying to pave a different path toward musical creativity,” says Jacob Gordon, an Artiphon co-founder, of the device (and its companion smartphone app), which raised $1.3 million on Kickstarter. —Victor Luckerson Tesla Model X / est. $130,000 Available 2016 Tesla’s Model X, unveiled in September, marks a leap toward a reality in which electric cars aren’t simply exotic, but just as useful as their competition. The world’s first luxury electric SUV can go 250 miles on a charge, Tesla says, and haul seven passengers. It features futuristic back doors that open like the wings of a bird (up, not out). And the Model X is a blast to drive: it can hit 60 m.p.h. from a standstill in 3.2 seconds, and its battery pack gives it a low center of gravity, enabling sports-car-like handling. (That’s rare for any SUV, let alone one that runs on clean power.) For Tesla, more than one model is at stake. As CEO Elon Musk put it during the Model X unveiling: people need to know “that any kind of car can go electric.” —Matt Vella CogniToys Dino / $120 Buy here  Rather than repeating catchphrases, as “talking” toys have done for generations, this dinosaur taps IBM’s Watson technology to engage with kids ages 5 to 9 in a meaningful way. In addition to answering plain-language queries (like “How far away is the moon?”), the wi-fi-enabled figurine talks back and learns from kids’ responses—helping them hone their math skills, for example, by asking harder questions once they nail, “What is 2+2?” and “Can you count to 10?” The trick, according to CogniToys CEO Donald Coolidge, is to make educational development seem like a “cool, fun experience.” “That’s kind of the best toy possible,” he says. —Sarah Begley The announcement comes as both Facebook-owned Oculus VR as well as HTC are preparing to launch their high-end Rift and Vive VR headsets later this year. Both headsets are bigger, more complex virtual reality systems that need to be hooked up to a powerful computer to work. Their experiences are both higher-quality than those offered by simpler headsets like Google Cardboard. Cardboard’s advantage, though, is that it’s much more accessible than competing headsets, even more so than Samsung’s $99 Gear VR. Most Cardboard viewers only cost about $20 and work with your phone, whereas the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive will require the support of a computer that costs upwards of $1,000. The Oculus Rift alone costs $600 before you factor in the hardware needed to support it. Although the Oculus Rift has included spacial audio for quite some time, it’s clear that Google is aiming to make the Cardboard experience better as virtual reality becomes more popular and competitive. Industry watchers have also said in the past that audio is becoming increasingly important to the virtual and augmented reality experience. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster acknowledged this when discussing Apple’s decision to hire an audio engineer from Microsoft who previously worked on the company’s HoloLens headset.

{"type": "article", "header": "I Finally Tried Virtual Reality and It Brought Me to Tears", "author": "John Patrick Pullen", "update_date/publish_date": "January 8, 2016 12:00 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4172998/virtual-reality-oculus-rift-htc-vive-ces/", "text": "The light poured directly into my eyes. It flashed, strobed, pulsated, faded, and changed color, desperately begging for my attention. Meanwhile, my ears flooded with a radio dial full of sound: an ad for a steakhouse, music by Rihanna, comedy shows, everything all at once. It was, in a word, overwhelming. Then again, you don’t visit Las Vegas for peace and quiet. But when I put virtual reality goggles on, that’s exactly what I found. Instantly, the city built on spectacle became nothing more than a shell, a blank container serving only to hold myself and whatever rich, new world I had just wrapped around my head. Over the past four days at CES, I embraced every virtual reality (VR) experience I could get my eyes on. From the crude but accessible Google Cardboard to the much ballyhooed Oculus Rift, I tried them all. I stood alone on the deck of a shipwreck and looked a whale in the eye. I strapped into a wooden rollercoaster alongside dozens of other people and nearly lost my lunch. I climbed Mount Everest in sneakers and jeans. Back here in reality, VR has me concerned about the future of everything: entertainment, travel, gaming, work — you name it. And I so badly want to go back in. Read more: Here’s what you’ll need to try virtual reality Before I pull back the curtain on VR, I should reveal more about myself. VR is a deeply personal experience, and what clicks for one person won’t for another. This breathtaking new medium is perception, pure and simple, and who you are in the real world influences how you respond to the virtual one. If I had to describe myself in three words, they would be: writer, father, grump. The first term is obvious, and for the second, I’m the proud dad to an inquisitive toddler. As for the third — and CES fatigue is influencing this — I can’t stand bright, flashing lights, loud noises, crowds, congested places, and most amusement park rides (especially roller coasters). Oh, and I don’t gamble, I never do drugs, and I can barely sip on a beer per week lest I fall asleep. Yet here I am in Las Vegas, a city that’s one giant sensory overload, for CES, the world’s most overwhelming trade show. As a technology writer, it’s a place I need to be in a city I should never visit. Prior to this week, I had never used VR. Frankly I wasn’t all that excited to try it. But after my first experience, I was hooked. Hosted by a company called YouVisit, I used the Samsung Gear VR headset to explore a collection of 360-degree experiences. In 20 minutes, I was able to explore Paris, tour a Carnival cruise ship, take in a catwalk view of Russia’s fashion week, and even enjoy an EDM concert (okay, “enjoy” may be the wrong word). Most importantly, the experience helped me see VR as more than just a gimmick. It’s a technology that can bring people places they might not otherwise reach. A high school senior can tour a college without trekking across the country. A wheelchair-bound music fan can get in the front row at a rock concert. And a relocating home buyer can view a new house from the comfort of their old one. My next VR experience, however, took me to a place I never imagined I’d ever visit: The deck of a shipwreck. An experience on the HTC Vive headset from Wevr, theBlu: Encounter teleports people to the depth of the ocean floor. There, a computer animated whale, apparently the same scale as a real one, swims past. It’s a quick hit in a simple environment, but a stirring one. The whale looked me in the eye and seemed to grin slightly. I couldn’t help myself from smiling back. It was a beautiful moment, but an isolating one. More than anything, I wished my wife could have been there to share the undersea experience with me. I wanted her to know this awe-inspiring beauty. I also wanted her to abandon a world full of mortgages, diapers, rush hour commutes, and grocery shopping, even if just for a minute. Alas, that’s one of the drawbacks of some VR experiences. In this world, you’re alone. Like a visit to the moon, it’s impossible to describe VR to someone who’s never been there. The technology isn’t just physically isolating — in some ways it divides us emotionally, too. But there’s also a feeling of community among people who have enjoyed the same VR experiences. Wandering around CES this week, I watched dozens of people with VR goggles on. Before I put a pair on my face, I looked at these people and snickered over how goofy they looked from the outside, flailing about nonsensically. But after trying virtual reality myself, I found myself focusing on their smiles instead. Then, all I felt towards them was a genuine happiness. “Look at how much they’re enjoying themselves right now,” I thought. It’s dopey, but true. For my money — and it will take a lot — the HTC Vive is the most engrossing virtual reality experience you can try right now. That’s mostly because the rig lets you walk around in a limited area to better explore a virtual space. Its users also hold a pair of joysticks, each resembling half a PlayStation controller. But the shape of the controllers is irrelevant once you strap on the Vive, because the computer tricks your mind into believing your hands are whatever appears on the screen. In Job Simulator — an absurdly fun game despite revolving around mundane workplace tasks — your hands are a pair of blocky Hamburger Helper-like gloves. And because of this, the act of picking up a coffee mug or plugging in a computer is both novel and delightful. And though I was dropped into an environment that looked like an early ‘90s PC game, I couldn’t help but think about my son. At 18 months old, he’s just starting to make sense of the reality we all take for granted. Pushing buttons and opening drawers in Job Simulator was so delightful that it helped me understand why he loves opening and closing that one cabinet in our real life kitchen that I haven’t managed to safety latch. But the VR experience that moved me to tears was Toy Box on Oculus Rift. A virtual sandbox where you can play with all kinds of toys, this game lets two players interact in the same virtual space simultaneously. Each player wears their own Oculus Rift headset and headphones, with a controller in both hands. From there, anything goes: You can take target practice with a laser gun, get in a firefight with one another’s toy tanks, or pull apart a robot doll and wear its parts. Then my playmate, Erin, shot me with a shrink ray. Suddenly, not only were all the toys enormous to me, but Erin’s avatar was looming over me like a hulking giant. Her voice even changed as it poured through my headphones, entering my head with a deep, slow tone. And for a moment, I was a child again, with this giant person lovingly playing with me. It gave me such a profound perspective on what it must be like to be my son, that I started to cry inside the headset. It was a pure and beautiful experience that will reshape my relationship with him moving forward. I was vulnerable to my giant playmate, yet felt completely safe. Virtual reality isn’t all illusions and epiphanies. As fun as Toy Box was, it included some toys that concerned me. Within the experience, you can play with a virtual zippo lighter and fireworks. Don’t get me wrong, it was fun as heck. But if there’s one thing everyone knows it’s that you don’t play with fire. Well, not everyone knows this — children may not yet understand the real world consequences of dangerous objects, and this game certainly won’t help. Erin lit firecrackers and threw them at me. I launched Roman candles at her. And when I was done lighting the fuses, I would often just leave my lighter on the table, open and burning away. That’s just one way VR could be problematic. It makes me wonder how more violent VR titles, like the zombie hunting game Arizona Sunshine or the Matrix-like first-person shooter Bullet Train, will affect children’s perception of reality. I’m not alone in this concern. Ironically, one person who shares it with me is Paul Bettner, founder and CEO of gaming company Playful. Perhaps best known for building Words With Friends, Bettner is now developing Lucky’s Tale, a cute, colorful Super Mario Bros.-like virtual reality game. Unlike every other VR experience I had, it’s played in the third person. Coming bundled with the Oculus Rift when that headset launches this spring, Lucky’s Tale is aimed at the kid in all of us. Still, Bettner has reservations about VR’s effect on children. We chatted for almost an hour as I got some face time with the Oculus, and it’s clear that despite Bettner’s amazing games, his children are his most proud creation. And though he plays a lot of games with them, he doesn’t give them much, if any, VR time. There’s just no information yet about the long-term effects of this technology on still-developing minds. But casting fears aside, this new medium is simply fascinating. One reason the world is fascinated with millennials is that they never knew a world without the Internet. Post-millennials, like my son, will never know life without virtual reality. Because they can live in someone else’s virtual shoes, will they be more empathetic? Forget Job Simulator — will playing the victim in a bully simulator become mandatory for schoolchildren? Will gut-wrenching, first-person films like Chris Milk’s The Displaced help them understand the world? Will they stop watching and reading the news in favor of experiencing it? After days of immersion into the technology and being knocked off-balance by sleepless nights, my understanding of the real world started to wobble and shift. While being herded through a crowded casino, I wondered if I could step aside, mentally, into another virtual space, even without the equipment. I started to think of this reality (if Las Vegas can even be considered real) as a trick not unlike VR. Eventually, I made my way back to my hotel room. There, I stared out the window at the famous Strip as I considered selling furniture to finance and make room for my own VR setup. Meanwhile, my hotel room’s windows lit up with waves of colors slowly crawling across. I realized that, to the parade of tourists and taxis below, my hotel was a giant display, and I was nothing more than a pixel. All I wanted to be was on the other side, looking in, wrapped in light. This is what addiction feels like, I was sure of it. In Sin City, I finally found my vice. And it’s escape.

{"type": "article", "header": "This Futuristic Armband Lets You Control Your Computer Like Magic", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "January 20, 2016 11:58 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4173507/myo-armband-review/", "text": "The good: Easy-to-remember gestures; Accurate and fast gesture detection; Works with existing popular games. The bad: Expensive; Limited standalone game selection; Hard to troubleshoot. Who should buy it: Gamers and those with big budgets who want to control their computer from a distance. Bottom line: The Myo Armband can accurately detect gestures, but it’s expensive and the game selection could be bigger. Tech companies have long been trying to convince us that waving at our screens is a better way of interacting with our computers than using a mouse, keyboard, or controller. Microsoft’s Kinect, Nintendo’s Wii, Sony’s PlayStation Move, Intel’s RealSense technology, the Leap Motion Controller — the list goes on. Still, even with technological improvements, there has yet to be a game-changing device that’s really better than the status quo. Now, one more company is throwing its hat in the gesture-control ring, albeit with a different approach. Rather than using special cameras that sense motion and depth, startup Thalmic Labs’ Myo armband detects a wearer’s movements and translates them into computer controls. After slipping the Myo armband on your forearm, its sensors begin reading electrical activity in your muscles. This is how it’s able to detect gestures, which are then relayed to your computer to do things like control an aircraft in a game or flip through tunes on Spotify. Unlike those aforementioned technologies, the Myo doesn’t require you to be in a camera’s line of sight. The futuristic-feeling $200 Myo differentiates itself from other gesture control gadgets in interesting ways. But it doesn’t make me believe we’ll all be waving at our computers and gaming consoles any time soon. Here’s a closer look at what it’s like to use. Wearing it The Myo band looks unlike most other wearable technologies. It’s not a compact device meant to blend in with your everyday attire, like an Apple Watch or a Fitbit. Thalmic’s accessory is sizable. Rather than wearing it on your wrist, the device is meant to fit snugly on your forearm, a prime spot for detecting muscle activity. It takes a few minutes for the sensors to warm up, so the metal interior sometimes felt chilly when I first put it on. The first few minutes using the Myo were awkward. It felt unnatural to wear something on my forearm, let alone a vibrating band that’s noticeably larger than your average watch or bracelet. But once I embraced the new feeling, I barely remembered I was wearing it. Even after extended use, the metal sensors inside the bracelet never get too hot. The band stretches so that it can fit forearms of different sizes with ease, but it’s also possible to adjust the links to get a better fit. Using it There’s a slight learning curve that comes with using the Myo. But here’s where the Myo differs from similar devices: Wearers use the same five motions with every app. Whether you’re chopping watermelons in Fruit Ninja or pausing a video on YouTube, Myo’s gestures are exactly the same — they just correspond to different actions in with different software, not unlike a mouse’s buttons behave from app to app. Of all the Myo experiences I tried, there were three that stood out: controlling music or video, playing casual games, and manipulating toys made by Sphero. The first scenario probably wouldn’t be helpful while sitting in front of a laptop, since clicking or tapping a key would take less effort than a wave. But it did prove helpful in another setting that involved more multitasking. I often blast Spotify from my laptop as I clean up my bedroom. Wearing the Myo, I found that flicking my wrist outward to skip a song saved me a few seconds and kept me focused on the task at hand. This worked easily most of the time, but occasionally it would confuse the motion for skipping a song with pausing one. Still, these gestures, which involve spreading your fingers to pause or play a track and waving your hand in or out to jump between songs, worked well in iTunes and YouTube, too. Playing with it Gaming is where the Myo really shines. That’s especially evident when playing endless flyer Aircraft Maniac. The game’s objective is simple: Soar as far as you can without crashing into any obstacles. It’s comparable to popular arcade game Race the Sun, which also works with the Myo armband. Aircraft Maniac feels like a natural fit for the Myo. A series of subtle wrist tilts and clenched fists were all it took to zoom past towering pillars and complete the course. It was fun and surprisingly addictive. But nothing I did with the Myo was as amusing as using it to control a Sphero device, which are spherical robotic toys typically controlled with a smartphone. There’s just something that feels downright cool about being able to summon a tiny robot with the wave of a hand. Using the Myo + Sphero app, Myo users can manipulate the miniature robot by rotating their wrist rather than tapping a smartphone’s screen. The app is meant to work with the original ball-shaped Sphero and the Ollie, a cylindrical robot that vaguely resembles a set of wheels. But I don’t own either of these devices. Instead, I tried hooking up the Myo armband to Sphero’s BB-8 Star Wars toy. Unexpectedly, it worked — kind of. I was able to command BB-8 by spreading my fingers and tell him to stop by making a fist. More complicated navigations were a little unstable, however. It’s worth noting the Myo armband can be used to control certain drones from Parrot, too. The downsides One of my favorite aspects of the Myo is also one of its biggest drawbacks. Many of the apps in the Myo Market’s gaming section are “connectors,” or apps that let you use Myo with existing games. This is an excellent advantage if you already own these games, like Counter-Strike, World of Tanks, Saints Row V, and Skyrim, among others. But if you don’t have these titles and aren’t willing to shell out the money for them, Myo’s standalone game selection looks fairly limited. And when you take into account that not every game is available for every computing platform, that selection becomes even smaller. I imagine this will eventually change as more developers spend time building games for the Myo. Although using the Myo feels natural once you get past the learning curve, I can’t say the same about troubleshooting any issues. If you’re having problems turning on or using the armband, you may have to download and re-install the firmware, which isn’t the most user-friendly process. Final thoughts Ultimately, the Myo armband is too expensive for a gadget I can only see myself using occasionally in specific circumstances. That doesn’t mean I don’t see potential for the Myo. It could be useful as a productivity tool, allowing workers to breeze through presentations with a quick shake of the wrist rather than glancing down at a computer, for instance. And it’s also capable of working with the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, perhaps making VR worlds feel more immersive. Even still, $200 is a steep price for what the Myo does today. While it’s fun to use in some cases, it didn’t leave me convinced that our gesture-controlled future is here just yet. 3 out of 5 stars Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3828913/star-wars-force-awakens-bb8-toy/"], "sentiment_score": 0.09471729769348815, "subjectivity_score": 0.5037035605487986},

In light of this, TIME has rescinded our recommendation of the Note 7. Below is our original review, written before the issues came to light. The good: Premium design, long battery life, great camera, helpful stylus The bad: Bloatware, Edge panel doesn’t add much to the experience Who should buy: Those seeking a larger-sized Android phone, especially for productivity After a quick tap, the tiny red light began to gleam. This signal indicated that the device was scanning my irises to make sure I was authorized for access. This isn’t an excerpt from a science fiction novel — it’s how I’ve been unlocking my phone over the past week. An iris scanner is among the standout features on Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, the latest device in the South Korean company’s series of large-screened, stylus-toting Android smartphones. The Note 7, which launches on August 19, is a modest but welcome improvement over its predecessor, offering a more ergonomic design, an enhanced stylus, the same camera as its Galaxy S7 cousin, and some software tweaks. It costs around $30 per month, or more than $800 without a payment plan, depending on the carrier. The Note 7’s launch comes just weeks before Apple is expected to unveil its much-rumored iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the latter of which is a direct competitor to Samsung’s Note lineup. Samsung and Apple are the top two smartphone vendors in the world, but their approaches are wildly different. The Note 7, in some ways, is everything the iPhone isn’t: it’s water-resistant, there’s a stylus, it can scan your eyeballs, it comes with three times as much storage by default with the ability to add more, and it charges wirelessly. But the phone’s software is also much more convoluted than that of the iPhone — unlike Apple’s smartphone, it comes with promotional apps from your carrier. I’ve spent the past several days using the Galaxy Note 7 for all of my daily tasks instead of my usual iPhone. Here’s a closer look at what that’s been like. Hardware Samsung’s smartphones have become nearly indistinguishable from one another since the Galaxy S6 was released in the spring of 2015. Like last year’s Note 5 (Samsung skipped the 6), the Note 7 is made of glass and metal, with its S Pen stylus neatly tucked away in a port at the bottom of the phone. This year’s model looks mostly similar to last year’s, albeit with a slimmer overall profile. This is a nice change, making it easier to hold in one hand. The phone is also water-resistant, dust-proof, and packs Samsung’s fast-charging technology. Samsung offers two ways to unlock the Note 7 without typing in a passcode: holding your thumb on the home button’s fingerprint sensor, or gazing at the iris scanner above the screen. I found the fingerprint sensor to be slightly faster (because you need to swipe the lock screen to activate the iris scanner), but the iris scanner was more reliable (and more futuristic). The fingerprint scanner would sometimes fail to recognize my thumb, but the iris scanner worked almost every time, whether I was wearing contacts or glasses. The only time I found it difficult to use was when I was outside squinting in bright daylight. The iris scanner is also helpful for instances when your finger is wet, which makes it difficult or impossible for the sensor to read your print. This is an issue I encounter with my iPhone’s fingerprint scanner fairly often. The Note 7’s iris scanner and fingerprint sensor can also be used to access files and apps stored in the phone’s Secure Folder, a separate hub for private content. The Note 7’s 64GB of storage, along with its SD card slot, will satisfy those who store lots of photos and videos on their phone. The iPhone is available in 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB varieties, but it doesn’t have a port to add more storage. That means iPhone owners who want more storage space need a new phone, or they need to store more content in the cloud. This also means the starting price is more expensive than the entry level versions of the iPhone (16GB) and Galaxy S7 (32GB). The Note 7’s larger screen also makes it more expensive than the Galaxy S7. Samsung’s new smartphone lasted more than a full day on a single charge, which is great for those who often find themselves searching for outlets. After nearly 24 hours, the phone still had about 40% battery remaining. Battery life will vary depending on what you use your phone for, how often you receive notifications, and whether or not features like Bluetooth and your phone’s mobile hotspot are turned on. I used the Note 7 for basic everyday needs like reading email, checking social media, playing casual games, streaming Netflix, and doing a little bit of work in Google Drive. The Note 7 includes the same gorgeous 2,560×1,440 AMOLED screen as its predecessor, making it a great choice for those who often use their phone for watching movies. It also has the same 12-megapixel camera as the Galaxy S7, which captures rich, vibrant shots. When comparing the Note 7’s camera against that of the iPhone 6s Plus, I noticed the Samsung produced bolder, more vivid colors in some circumstances. The iPhone, meanwhile, captured colors more as they appeared in real life. See for yourself in the images below. Notice how the sky and water in the photo taken on the Note 7 look bluer and brighter, while the water in the iPhone’s photo looks a bit more green. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 iPhone 6s Plus     Software With the Note 7, Samsung has made a clear effort to simplify its software. Yes, there’s still a widget advertising Samsung’s services and a handful of apps from my carrier (T-Mobile) that I’ll probably never use. And yes, the phone still comes with two separate apps for email and Web browsing and two app stores, since the Note 7 includes both Samsung and Google’s stock apps. Even so, Samsung deserves credit for the subtle improvements it’s made to the Note 7’s software. The Settings menu, for instance, has been condensed and streamlined for easier navigation. Samsung’s note-taking apps have been combined into one app, Samsung Notes, to avoid confusion and clutter. And some of the features Samsung adds to Android are actually helpful, especially when it comes to the Note and its S Pen stylus. Ejecting the S Pen from its holster launches a fan-like menu with a selection of stylus-optimized apps, like Samsung Notes, Screen Write (snap a screenshot and annotate it), Smart Select (capture a GIF of a video on screen using the stylus), and Translate (translate text in a foreign language). This feature makes the S Pen more useful — the stylus experience wouldn’t feel as effective without it. That said, the Note 7’s interface still isn’t as simple as I’d like it to be. In terms of software, I prefer plain, stripped-down versions of Android, like those found on Google’s Nexus phones and the OnePlus 3. While I enjoy the capabilities Samsung has added for the S Pen, there are some add-ons I could live without, such as the Edge panel. This strip, which is accessible by swiping in from the right of the screen, includes shortcuts to your favorite apps, contacts, and tasks. But since Android users can pin widgets and apps to their home screen, the Edge panel is superfluous. It doesn’t make any tasks faster or more convenient for me, and I’ve accidentally launched it when trying to navigate between home screens. The Note 7 has also adopted the Galaxy S7’s always-on display, meaning you can see information like the time, date, and your phone’s battery level even when the phone is idle. It’s handy to see this data without waking your phone, but sometimes I forgot that I need to press a button to fully activate the phone, since it feels like it’s already on. You can also pin notes written with the S Pen to the Note 7’s lock screen, which can be helpful for keeping reminders and to-do lists easily reachable. The headline features that Samsung introduced on previous Note devices, like the ability to view apps in split-screen view, are also present on the Note 7. Conclusion Samsung has long tried to make its smartphones stand out by giving them unconventional capabilities. With the Note 7, Samsung has maintained this willingness to experiment, while also learning from past criticisms. The Note 7’s gorgeous glass build, improved S Pen, reliable camera, long battery life and water resistance make it one of the best Android phones available. It’s not perfect; — the software could be cleaner and easier to use. But Samsung is making it increasingly difficult to remain a full-time Apple user. We’ll soon see what Cupertino has up its sleeves. 4.5 out of 5 stars Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.16614106521893401, "subjectivity_score": 0.4905474534572894},

The Redmond, Wash. company is expected to unveil more details about the future of Windows this week at its annual Build conference. The event comes after Microsoft recently debuted new products including Windows 10 S and the Surface Laptop . Harman Kardon also just revealed its new Invoke smart speaker, which is powered by Microsoft’s Cortana virtual assistant. Terry Myerson, Microsoft’s executive vice president of the Windows and devices group, sat down with TIME to discuss the future of Windows, Microsoft’s hardware efforts, virtual reality, and more. Below is a transcript of our conversation edited for length and clarity. TIME: Over the past several months there’s been a bigger focus on how students and creative professionals can use Windows and Surface devices. Why? Terry Myerson: It’s become more than just a focus. If you go back in time to three years ago when Satya [Nadella] first became CEO, there was this vision of ubiquitous computing. Everything around us was going to become smart and connected, whether it was coffee pots, the lights, your phone, everything. And there was this question of: What was Windows’ role? Where are we going to go? There was this defining moment when someone on the team sent me this TED Talk about great companies. It talked about how great companies know what they do and how they do it, but great companies also know why they do what they do. I think prior to us thinking about our purpose this way, we might have had an event where we talked about a new version of Windows that had certain features and a new laptop that had certain specs. But you step back and you say, “why would the world want these things? What is the impact we could have, and where could we have the biggest impact?” It’s not just the event, you have to start early and start with that purpose and what you’re doing. It’s very authentic. This authentic concept about, why Windows, why Surface, where we want to go in this world where everything is going to be smart. When the first Surface was announced in 2012, it started as a tablet that could replace your laptop, and now here we are with a Surface laptop. Can you talk about the strategy that went into that decision? At the core of the Windows ecosystem today, laptops are the category where we have the most impact on the world. We participate in so many categories, from mixed reality to large screens to phones to laptops . . . and laptops are the biggest category. In laptops we saw an opportunity to really try and set a new bar. At the core of it is Windows 10 S, the ability to design a device specifically for this new platform. That’s what allows us to have the 14.5 hours of battery life. That’s what allows us to have the better performance. Our partners are going to look at the customer reception to it and decide should they, should they not, it’s their business. But our goals are to grow the Windows ecosystem. This isn’t the first time Microsoft has launched more than one version of Windows. Windows RT, the “lighter” version of Windows 8 that debuted in 2012, wasn’t heavily embraced by partners, caused confusion among customers, and was eventually phased out. Why will Windows 10 S be different, and what have you learned? There are things that are distinctly different. RT ran on ARM underpowered processors. This is going to run on every class of hardware. There are some low-spec devices it will run on, but it will also run on the Surface Laptop, which is a beautiful premium device. If you buy a Windows 10 S device, you can switch to Windows Pro. That’s a big difference versus, you just buy it and you get what you get. So now you have a performance system, you have a way to say “Okay, I don’t want these constraints, I want to go out into the open world.” There are a lot more apps in the Windows Store now than there was. This version of Windows is more popular than Windows 8 Those are all learnings we might not have had if we couldn’t reflect on the past. But that’s what we do, we’re always trying to learn. When you go back in time and look at what they were trying to achieve, it was in some ways similar. If I had to pick a fourth thing, it’s really focusing on, at least initially, these students in the classroom. RT was launched as more of a consumer product. You talked before about how many new types of devices will become “smart” and capable of connecting to one another. How do you see Cortana playing a bigger role as this transition occurs? Everything around us will be smart and connected. And you’re just going to expect a certain level of intelligence when you’re dealing with all of your things, that they’re all going to work together in all the right ways. I think with each of these assistants, there’s opportunity to be the glue that provides the orchestration across all of the devices in our lives. All these scenarios where there are all these apps and devices in our lives. We don’t really want to interact with any one of them, we want to interact to achieve a goal, a purpose. And I do think having one of these personal assistants understand how to interact with apps and devices, that’s the vision we want to achieve. How will voice be a bigger part of the way we interact with apps on Windows and Surface in the future? Amazon struck a chord with voice with Echo. It’s great work. We’ve supported voice in our devices for a long time. But how often do you talk to your laptop? These phones have had voice support, and sometimes people use it, but not like they do with Echo. And so I do think we’re developing all of these input technologies at a core platform capability. But getting the device form factor right, where there’s something innately human about interacting with it, is critical. Of all the devices we have, where people are using voice the most is Xbox. People are home, they put their headsets on, and they’re talking to each other. The ‘Hey Cortana’ scenario shows up on Xbox a lot. But the Surface scenario, voice is there and we’re developing it, but I don’t think we’ve nailed the right scenario yet. One of the most interesting announcements from last year’s Surface Studio event was the Surface Dial. As we move into augmented and virtual reality, how is Microsoft thinking about new forms of interaction? When we started out with this mixed reality journey, we had gaze, gesture, and voice. We started out with this vision that the world would be your display. We always knew there was going to be this spectrum of virtual reality where your displays are opaque, and augmented reality where the display is translucent. And this spectrum, we called it mixed reality. But our first big bet was with Hololens, which was augmented reality. And gaze, gesture, and voice were the three things we bet on: where you are looking, what you are pointing at, and what you are saying. Having a display that is translucent sometimes, opaque sometimes, and you can wear it all the time, you know [Facebook CEO Mark] Zuckerberg has talked about that, we’ve talked about that. I think that’s a frontier that we all can see in the future. I picture us having this giant Jenga set in front of us. Now we actually have the technology to reach out and push that Jenga bar and have all the right physics so that it falls down correctly. But you don’t feel it. You don’t feel the friction. That’s the scenario I think about all the time. Will mixed reality ever be mainstream? For those who aren’t using it for gaming or commercial use cases, will it ever be the new home computer? I think it will revolutionize gaming and entertainment, I think it will revolutionize so many things that are done away from desks. I don’t think it’s going to replace the work you do at your desk, but when people are away from their desk, when their hands are free. I remember looking out from my office a couple of weeks ago and someone was spray-painting the street to say “there’s a pipe down here.” And I remember thinking that’s so lame; they should be able to see a virtual map of where the pipe is. If we can get that presence right, I think it’s just going to revolutionize our lives, allow us to connect when we’re apart.

Many industry observers were expecting the company to unveil a strategy to combat Google’s dominance of the classroom through its Chromebooks, which accounted for 58% of device shipments to primary and secondary schools in the U.S. last year, according to research firm Futuresource Consulting. Sure enough, Microsoft debuted a simpler, closed-off version of its operating system called Windows 10 S, which is aimed at optimizing speed, security, and battery life even on low-spec machines. But during that same event, Microsoft also unveiled the Surface Laptop, a $999 machine shipping on June 15 that will be the first to run the classroom-focused Windows 10 S. That price point makes the Surface Laptop much more expensive than most Chromebooks, with high end models like the HP Chromebook 13 starting at $619. Microsoft execs now say that although the company has thought about different price tiers, its focus for the Surface lineup is fixated on providing a premium experience. “When we think about the lower price points, that’s kind of where we stop,” Panos Panay, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of devices, said in an interview with TIME on June 12. “We have lots of partners, great ones. We’re not trying to recreate a $400 laptop just to make a laptop.” Panay argued the price point was necessary in order to guarantee quality when it comes to elements like battery life, display, and performance. “All of that is part of staying premium,” he said. “[It] gives us the room to make those decisions. You start to see that as you move lower down on the price point, those decisions start to change very quickly.

But Android-powered slates have come a long way since the clunkier models of five years ago, back when Android apps didn’t even work smoothly on a larger screen. Enter Samsung’s $599.99 Galaxy Tab S3, which recently became available for preorder. With its high price, stylus support, and powerful processor, Samsung is gunning for Apple’s $599 iPad Pro and other similar high-end tablets. Samsung’s new gadget has a brilliantly vibrant screen and includes the company’s S Pen stylus in the box, unlike Apple which charges an extra $99 for the Apple Pencil. But the iPad Pro has a few benefits over Samsung’s tablet that could persuade some buyers, especially iPhone owners, particularly when it comes to power and battery. After using the Tab S3 alongside the 9.7-inch iPad Pro for the past few days, here’s a closer look at how they compare. One of the most noticeable differences between Samsung’s Tab S3 and the iPad Pro is the way their screens look. The Tab S3 supports HDR video playback and, like many other Samsung gadgets, includes a Super AMOLED screen. These displays typically produce deeper blacks and better contrast than other display types. Apple, by comparison, uses LED display technology for the iPad Pro. Read more: The Ultimate MacBook Buyer’s Guide As a result, colors looked much more vibrant and punchy on Samsung’s tablet than on the iPad Pro. That’s not to say the iPad Pro has a dull screen, but Samsung’s is exceptionally vivid and much brighter. Samsung is pushing its new tablet as being ideal for entertainment, and the Tab S3’s screen is sure to please those who frequently stream video and browse photos on their mobile device. Still, in my experience, the iPad Pro offered clearer and richer audio that packed more bass than Samsung’s, even though both slates have four speakers. But that impressive screen may come at the cost of battery life. When using the Tab S3 and iPad Pro side-by-side over the course of a day, Samsung’s battery had reached 58% while the iPad Pro’s was at 73% after roughly five and a half hours of usage. Regardless, that’s still plenty of juice to get you through a several daily commutes or a long flight. Both Apple and Samsung are also touting their tablets as productivity machines and have created keyboard and stylus accessories with this in mind. The Tab S3 comes with the S Pen, the same stylus that was introduced with the company’s Note smartphones, and Samsung sells a compatible keyboard case for $129.99. Apple, meanwhile charges $99 for its Apple Pencil stylus and $149 for a keyboard case designed to work with the iPad Pro. This alone makes the Tab S3 a better value than the iPad: a 32GB Samsung tablet with the S Pen and keyboard costs $749, while a 32GB iPad Pro with an Apple Smart Keyboard Cover and Apple Pencil costs about $847. Plus. the Tab S3 includes a microSD card slot for adding more storage space, whereas the iPad does not. In practice, both the Apple Pencil and S Pen worked smoothly when jotting down notes and sketching doodles. I rarely find myself drawing and coloring, but I generally preferred Samsung’s S Pen because it’s better equipped for more practical use cases. I could, for example, translate text to another language in real time just by hovering the tip of the S Pen over a word or phrase. It’s also possible to save a snippet of text from an article or create a GIF from a video simply by using the S Pen to draw a lasso around the area you’d like to extract. The Apple Pencil lacks such capabilities. I also much preferred Samsung’s keyboard case over Apple’s: the keys were much deeper and sturdier, making it easier to type quickly without making mistakes. It’s a bit bulkier than the iPad Pro’s keyboard when being used as a standard case, but it’s worth the tradeoff. To truly be better than your smartphone at certain tasks, like working or web browsing, tablet software needs to take advantage of that larger screen. Both Apple and Samsung do this by offering the ability to view more than one app on screen at the same time. I found it easier to jump between apps on the iPad’s split screen mode, but Samsung’s allows for more flexibility. Both tablets are plenty powerful: whether I was playing games with demanding graphics, browsing the web, or editing photos, neither tablet showed signs of stuttering. I did notice, however, that when applying special effects to images using the app Prisma, the iPad processed pictures considerably faster than Samsung’s tablet every time. So which tablet should you buy? The answer boils down to which one best suits your needs. Samsung surpasses Apple when it comes to screen quality, overall value, and how well its stylus and keyboard accessories work. But Apple’s tablet performed slightly faster, offered better audio, and appeared to have a longer lasting battery. The decision will likely also depend on whether Android or iOS is more convenient for you. For iPhone owners, the ability to log in with your Apple ID and quickly download apps that you’ve already purchased, or continue iMessage threads you’ve started on your phone, may outweigh the benefits of a brighter, more colorful screen and a handy stylus. But Android owners and even iPhone owners that are impartial to Apple should strongly consider the Tab S3.

The new Surface Pro will be available on June 15 starting at $799; an LTE version will also be available. Microsoft says the new Surface Pro is 20% faster than the old Surface Pro 4. The company is also claiming 13.5 hours of battery life on a single charge, a 50% increase over the Surface Pro 4. That’s also longer than the 12 hours Apple claims for its MacBook Air. Microsoft’s Surface Pen stylus is getting some improvements as well, including more precise pressure sensitivity and a new tilt mode for shading. Microsoft also says the “ink” is more responsive to movement, so people who use the tablet for quick sketches or jotting down notes shouldn’t experience any lag. The updated tablet, which Microsoft is simply calling the “new Surface Pro” rather than sticking with its numerical sequence, will be available in Core i7, Core i5, and Core m variants. Like the Pro 4, it offers USB 3.0 ports rather than USB-C connectivity. That means it will work with older accessories, but could be problematic as gadget makers shift to the new, speedier USB-C standard. Some of Microsoft’s design choices with the new tablet are a sign that the company is aiming the device at the professional, creative and educational worlds. It’s compatible with the new Surface Dial, for instance, an accessory aimed at the artistic set. The kickstand has been redesigned so the tablet can lay nearly flat, which creative types may find useful. (It also resembles Microsoft’s artsy Surface Studio all-in-one computer that was unveiled last October). Furthermore, Microsoft is updating workplace software like Word, Excel and PowerPoint to better integrate with the Surface Pen, which office workers may find useful. The new Surface Pro comes just weeks after Microsoft unveiled its new Surface Laptop, a device the company is primarily marketing towards students but could be a worthy competitor to Apple’s MacBook Air lineup. Still, Microsoft’s announcement comes as the overall tablet market is in free-fall. Shipments of the devices have declined for nine consecutive quarters as of the end of 2016, according to research firm IDC. That may explain why Microsoft is pitching its new Surface products towards students and creative professionals, two groups that have a clear use for tablets. But it’s unclear if the new Surface Pro will be enough to revitalize Microsoft’s Surface business, where revenue recently dropped by 26% compared to the year-ago quarter.

It’s available to order starting March 24 and will be in Apple Stores next week. The new iPad differs from its pricier sibling in several ways: To start, it runs on the company’s A9 processor, not the Pro’s beefier A9X chipset, and it isn’t compatible with accessories like the Apple Pencil or SmartKeyboard. While the forthcoming iPad’s screen has the same 2,048 x 1,536 resolution as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, it’s not fully laminated and does not feature an anti-reflective coating like the company’s other tablets. The new iPad is also missing the 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s sharper camera and 4K video capabilities as well, offering an 8-megapixel camera versus the Pro’s 12-megapixel shooter and 1080p video recording instead. The tablet only has two speakers instead of the Pro’s four. Still, the tablet will be plenty powerful for those who intend to browse the web, check email, stream Netflix and play games, which is to say most people. Apple has been pushing the iPad Pro more for those who intend to use their tablet for creative and professional work, like photo and film editing, which are tasks that can require more processing power and a better camera. Despite its cheaper price, the new 9.7-inch iPad should be faster and more capable than Apple’s older iPad Air 2, which runs on a dated A8 processor versus the A9. In fact, the new iPad will replace the iPad Air 2, which is no longer present on Apple’s website. It’s rare for Apple to release a full-sized iPad at such a low price. The Air 2 debuted at a starting price of $499 for the16GB of storage in 2014, while the new iPad includes 32GB of space for roughly $170 less. It’s also cheaper than the 7.9-inch iPad mini 4, which starts at $399 and runs on an older processor but includes 128GB of storage. The discounted tablet could be a move to boost sales in an Apple product line that’s been steadily declining. During its most recent earnings report, Apple revealed that total iPad shipments dropped by 19%, while revenue from the tablets was down by 22%. Offering a cheaper option could give Apple fans and tablet shoppers a more compelling reason to upgrade from an older model or a mini. Data also suggests that shoppers prefer Apple’s less expensive slates over its Pro tablets: the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini accounted for most of the company’s tablet sales during the 2016 holiday quarter, according to The International Data Corporation.

The new Chromebook Pixel, named for its high-resolution touchscreen, boasts an Intel Core i5 processor with a boosted 8GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory (the old model had 4GB of RAM and the same storage space). The laptop also features a new charging standard called USB-C, which allows data and screen images to be transferred using the same port — Apple’s new MacBook, unveiled Monday, also uses USB-C. Google claims the new Pixel will get 12 hours of battery life. Like all Chromebooks, the Pixel uses Web-based apps to perform basic functions such as word processing, meaning its functionality is limited when you’re offline. Generally this helps keep Chromebooks cheap, typically retailing for just a few hundred dollars. But the Pixel is an exception — The basic model is on sale now for $999, while a higher-end model with increased memory retails for $1,299. Whether or not consumers will spring for a high-cost, limited-use laptop remains to be seen. Chromebook sales are rising fast, up 79% in 2014 according to research firm Gartner. But those numbers are likely driven by cheaper Chromebooks like the popular $329 Toshiba Chromebook 2, not Google’s own high-cost offerings.

The article below was originally published at TrustedReviews.com. First you’re in awe of how thin and light it is. Then you’re amazed that it’s totally fanless. Next you’re floored by its beautiful screen. You’re intrigued by its innovative Force Touch trackpad; envious of its flawless design; impressed that it’ll still last nine to ten hours on a full charge. But then you start to think about the practicalities of Apple’s new MacBook, announced Monday. It doesn’t have a normal USB port. There isn’t even a microSD slot, let alone a proper SD card slot like almost every other laptop on the planet. If I wanted an iPad, I’d buy an iPad. In fact, I already own one! What am I supposed to do with this? And there’s the key point. The new MacBook will replace the iPad for some people. Indeed, when you look at it closely, it has as much in common with an iPad as it does a laptop. It has a Retina screen like an iPad. It has a single connection for power and video out like an iPad. Its only other connection is a headphone jack just like an iPad. Here’s a great stat for you: the new MacBook is only 0.1mm thicker than the original iPad! Yes, seriously. Now let’s flip that around – what similarities does the new MacBook have with a typical laptop? It looks like a laptop. It has a keyboard like a laptop. It runs a laptop operating system and, well, that’s all I have. By my count, that’s a draw. That’s why I think the new MacBook is, in effect, an iPad-MacBook hybrid. It’s just not a hybrid in the way the Surface Pro 3 is a hybrid. It combines the spirit of the iPad and MacBook into one, not their incompatible designs. It is, in other words, the perfect laptop for the iPad generation. Some of you are probably thinking I’ve drunk the Apple Kool-Aid, that I’m a rabid Apple fanboy and my opinion isn’t worth jack. I urge patience. It’s true that all the things that make the new MacBook wrong for me (and you) are deeply annoying. Just try and remember that there’s a large body of people out there for whom none of those things matter. Let’s start with that SD card slot business. Have you seen camera sales recently? Every month the good folks at Gfk UK send me a report that shows the sales trends across various markets. I can’t remember the last time the photography market wasn’t 20% to 30% down year on year. That 20% to 30% are the people for whom a phone is the only camera they need, and whose photos sync wirelessly as they go. Next, let’s talk USB. USB is great and this new USB Type-C connection is a special thing – I recommend you read Edward Chester’s guide to USB Type-C when you get a spare moment. But even I don’t need USB ports that often – I most often use them to access press kits I’m given on a flash drive. For many people, a USB flash drive is a quaint tradition, though. They also don’t use printers, or at least use them wirelessly. They don’t have external hard drives. For the once in a blue moon that they’ll need a USB port, Apple will sell an adapter that includes video and USB connections. It’ll sit in a drawer for most of its life, I’ll wager. It’ll probably cost $70 or so, but does that matter when you’re buying a $1299 laptop? It’s a bit like agonizing over spending pocket change on a mobile app. It’s a similar story for video out. I bought a Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI cable when I bought my MacBook Air back in oh, 2011/12. I still haven’t used it. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but I just don’t need to plug my MacBook into screens anymore. Ordinary users need to do so even less than I do. And this is why the new MacBook is Apple’s hybrid. Anyone who’s ever bought a keyboard for their iPad is looking at the new MacBook very hard right now. If you can live with an iPad paired with a keyboard, you can live with a proper laptop with iPad-like restrictions. Moreover, so much of the software on Macs is now just like it is on iPads – the new Photos app, currently in public beta, is a near carbon copy of the iPad version. It’s increasingly true across the whole operating system, and that integration and homogenization is only going to increase. Related: Intel Core M: How it makes the new MacBook possible So, when a friend or relative expresses an interest in buying the new MacBook, remember that the things you care about probably don’t matter to them anymore. They’re a member of the iPad generation. They are, to use Steve Jobs’ brilliantly ambiguous term, “Post-PC”. And, for them, the new MacBook is everything they need in a laptop.

At a press briefing in San Francisco, the electronics giant introduced the long-anticipated update to its MacBook line. CEO Tim Cook touted the device’s light weight and thin enclosure. It weighs 2 lbs. and, at its thickest point, the MacBook is 13.1 millimeters thick, 24% thinner than the 11-inch MacBook Air. It also features the company’s ultra-high-resolution Retina display. And unlike previous models, the device will be available in multiple colors, silver, grey and gold. Introducing the computer, Cook joked with the audience, “It is unbelievable! Can you even see it?” Marketing chief Phil Schiller said the device represents the company’s vision of the future for notebooks. Rather than a multitude of ports, the device will have one connector, dubbed USB-C, to provide power, video output, and device connectivity. Schiller said the standard was being adopted across the computer industry. On stage, Schiller called it “the world’s most energy efficient laptop.” The base model MacBook comes with a 1.1 Ghz dual-core Intel Core M processor, Intel HD 3500 graphics, 8GB of memory, and a 256GB SSD hard drive. It begins at $1,299 and will be available next month. The company also announced several moderate upgrades to its other laptops. CEO Cook said during the presentation that while the notebook market shrank 2% last year, Apple’s MacBook business grew 21% during the same period. Ultra-light notebooks like the one Apple introduced today have been the lone bright spot as personal computer sales have sputtered over the past few years. According to researcher Gartner, sales of so-called ultra mobile premium computers like the new MacBook are expected to grow to 85 million annually, up from 39 million last year.

It will start at $999 and starts shipping June 15. The Surface Laptop is more like a MacBook-style notebook than Microsoft’s Surface Book. It doesn’t have a detachable screen, nor is its hinge meant to be seen. It will be available in four colors: burgundy, gold, platinum, and blue, and it weighs 2.7 pounds. That’s heavier than Apple’s 12-inch MacBook, but lighter than the MacBook Air. Microsoft’s Surface Laptop will include a 13.5-inch screen with a 3 x 2 aspect ratio, like Samsung’s Chromebook Pro and Plus, which the company says should make the screen feel like using a 14-inch device. Buyers will be able to choose between Intel Core i5 and i7 configurations, and Microsoft is claiming 14.5 hours of battery life. Apple, by comparison, claims that its MacBook Air can last for 12 hours. Recently released Microsoft accessories like the Surface Dial and Surface Pen will also work with the new PC. The Surface Laptop will run on a new version of Windows called Windows 10 S. It’s a simplified version of the Windows operating system aimed at classroom use that can only run content from the Windows Store. Windows 10 S laptops will be able to run full desktop programs so long as they’re available in the Windows Store, unlike Chromebooks. Once a student or teacher downloads a program from the Windows Store, the system verifies it for security and performance. A major goal with Windows 10 S is to ensure that Windows 10 S devices won’t slow down over time, says Terry Myerson, Microsoft’s executive vice president of the Windows and devices group. Performance should be the same on “day one as day 1,000,” he said. To optimize the software for classrooms, Microsoft focused on making it easy for students to log in for the first time and for teachers to configure new devices. When a student logs into a Windows 10 S PC for the first time, it will only take five seconds for the system to load, which should make it easier for teachers to jump into lessons, Microsoft says. Microsoft’s partners will also release devices that run on Windows 10 S, the cheapest of which will start at $189. The move could threaten Google’s dominance in the education market, where Chromebooks accounted for 58% of device shipments to primary and secondary schools in the U.S. last year, according to research firm Futuresource Consulting. Windows computers, meanwhile, only made up 22%, while iOS accounted for 14%. With its Surface Laptop, Microsoft appears to be offering a device that blends the appeal of a Chromebook and a MacBook Air. It’s portable and premium like Apple’s laptops, but is aimed at school and ease-of-use, like computers that run on Google’s Chrome OS. “How can technology create more opportunity not for a few, but for all?,” asked Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during Tuesday’s event. “Addressing that question is core to our mission to power every person and organization on the planet to achieve more.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4665643/samsung-chromebook-release-date-review-2017/"], "sentiment_score": 0.1495541351010101, "subjectivity_score": 0.4504813762626264},

Thanks to the rise of Chromebooks, it’s easier than ever to find a basic yet functional laptop for less than $400. But while Chromebooks have improved significantly over the last five years, buying one still means making tradeoffs. Chromebooks are (typically) inexpensive, but their Chrome OS operating system can’t handle demanding software like Photoshop or complex video games. And aside from Google’s pricey $1,299 Pixel, some models feel cheap compared to Windows and Mac laptops. Recently, however, Google and its partners have strived to make Chromebooks feel more like full-fledged PCs. A standout example is HP’s new Chromebook 13, among the few such computers to feature a polished, refined design that feels more like an Apple product. Google also recently announced that Android apps are coming to the Chrome ecosystem, giving some Chromebook owners plenty of new software to use. The new hardware and the incoming bounty of apps make the case for buying a Chromebook stronger than ever. But these inexpensive machines still aren’t for everybody. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use the HP Chromebook 13 for the past several days. Hardware When closed, the Chromebook 13 looks like a flat, sleek sheet of aluminum. As you lift the lid and power it on, the backlit keyboard begins to gleam. These are superficial details, but they’re a refreshing change from the plethora of plasticky Chromebooks out there. Still, this quality comes at a cost: depending on which configuration you choose, the Chromebook 13 can cost anywhere between $500 and $800. That’s on par with some mid-range Windows devices. The $500 entry level version is powered by an Intel Pentium processor, comes with 32GB of storage, 4GB of memory, and has a 13.3-inch 3,200×1,800 resolution screen. Paying $600 gets you a Core m3 processor, but leaves the same storage, memory, and display. For $819, you get a more powerful Core m5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and the same display and amount of storage. Further customization options allow you to swap out the processor and upgrade to a Core m7, choose a lower resolution 1920×1080 screen, or add more memory. Who’s it for? HP’s Chromebook 13 is suitable for most work-related tasks and casual needs. I used it as my primary work computer for two days, and found it was sufficient for handling most of my daily responsibilities, like writing, editing, researching, and communicating with coworkers. Chromebooks tend to rely heavily on the Internet, but I barely noticed when my Chromebook 13 lost its connection — Google Drive and Gmail, among other apps, have workable offline modes. In a nod to office workers, the Chromebook 13 supports virtual desktop software for accessing workplace programs remotely. But connecting the Chromebook 13 to a larger external monitor means buying an adapter or a dock — HP sells one for $149. Testing it out The Chromebook 13 is (mostly) a pleasure to use. The spacious keyboard, with its deep key travel, provides rich and tactile feedback that makes it easy to type quickly. It doesn’t feel flimsy or mushy when you press down on the keys, as is the case with some cheaper notebooks. The screen is crisp and clear enough to make for an enjoyable viewing experience when watching Netflix or viewing photos. My two complaints: The Chromebook 13’s screen can catch distracting glare, making it harder to view. Meanwhile, the touchpad’s mouse button felt clunky and sticky, requiring a harder press than usual to register a click. That sounds minor, but it grew irritating after a few days of use. The Chromebook 13’s battery lasted long enough to get me through nearly an entire workday. I was able to use the computer for roughly seven and a half hours before it died, which is on par with competitors like the Toshiba Chromebook 2 and the Lenovo ThinkPad 11e Chromebook, as PCMag and The Wirecutter have noted in their tests. That should get the job done for most users, but those who want to really go off the grid should shop around. Dell’s Chromebook 13 is said to get nearly 17 hours of battery life, while Acer’s Chromebook 14 reportedly lasts for more than 11 hours. Final word The HP Chromebook 13 is high-performing yet simple laptop that makes very few compromises. Those who already know they want a Chromebook and aren’t necessarily looking for the cheapest option certainly won’t be disappointed. At about half the price of Google’s Pixel, it’s the first affordable, truly premium Chromebook. That said, it’s worth taking a long look at your other options before pulling the trigger. Cheaper Chromebooks, while they may not be as attractive or comfortable to type on as HP’s latest, still offer a solid experience for hundreds of dollars less. The $300 Toshiba Chromebook 2 and $249 Asus Chromebook Flip, while they have have less memory and storage, are two strong examples. A Chromebook can be great option for those who want a very basic computer that requires no maintenance, making them an ideal choice for classrooms, kids, and grandparents. But if you’re going to commit $500 to $800 for a new computer, it’s worth thinking about whether you want that to be a Chromebook or a more traditional PC. 3.5 out of 5 stars Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/money/4132543/google-chromebook-christmas-gift/"], "sentiment_score": 0.12097913952282886, "subjectivity_score": 0.46095283626837025},

Read more: What Impressed Me the Most About Microsoft’s HoloLens Microsoft is giving developers a handful of apps intended to help them understand the HoloLens’ potential, including a holographic version of the Skype communications app and a world-exploring app called HoloTour. Games are in the mix too, like crime drama Fragments and platformer Young Conker, both of which turn players’ physical environments into the game space. “It is amazing how different the play experience feels based on playing the game in your living room versus your kitchen or your bedroom,” writes Microsoft’s Kudo Tsunoda in a blog post. “Even starting the game from a different position in a single room creates an entirely new gameplay dynamic.” Microsoft is shipping its futuristic headset to developers just as the first mainstream virtual reality devices are starting to arrive. The Facebook-owned Oculus VR’s Rift goggles are expected to ship at the end of March, while HTC’s Vive virtual reality eyewear is coming in April. Although the HoloLens experience might sound similar to virtual reality, it’s notably different.

Sphero, a Boulder, Colorado-based company that makes smartphone-controlled spheres, confirmed Monday it made the bi-spherical rolling robot for December’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It’s also making a toy version of the character destined to become a fan favorite to rival R2-D2 and C-3PO. Sphero did not reveal a release date or price point for the company’s BB-8 toy, but it is letting interested consumers sign up for updates through a cryptic landing page. “The experience is going to be king with this thing,” Sphero Chief Creative Officer Rob Maigret told TIME in a Monday interview. Maigret wouldn’t give away the secret sauce behind what makes BB-8 tick (magnets, perhaps?). But he did suggest the BB-8 toy could revive a fondly remembered part of the original Star Wars experience: Kids begging their parents to buy Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker toys letting them recreate scenes from the movies. “Our real goal here is that this should feel as close to what you just saw on the screen as possible,” he says. “And the relationships that you’ve seen BB-8 have in the film in the world of Star Wars, you can now fill that role. BB-8 is now yours.” Sphero has plenty of incentive to make sure its BB-8 toy flies — or, more accurately, rolls — off the shelves. Toy sales are by far the most lucrative part of the Star Wars financial empire. Forbes estimated back in 2007 that action figures and plastic spaceships accounted for $9 billion of the franchise’s sales, more than $3 billion more than the movies themselves. Sales of Star Wars toys are also known to get big boosts when new films (or even remastered old ones) hit the silver screen, so being in the business ahead of the Dec. 18 Force Awakens release is a good place to sit. Maigret wouldn’t divulge how much of the BB-8 toy revenue Sphero will get to keep, but it’s safe to say it isn’t nothing. Still, while he admits “it would be really nice to sell a gazillion BB-8s,” Maigret thinks it would be “even better” if “a lot of fans [were] extremely happy with what we provided them.” “We’re fans,” he adds. “For the folks here at Sphero, we’re freaking out.

We used to use our home computers for everything from checking email, to surfing the web, to listening to music. Now we’re doing that with our smartphones, tablets, and even voice-controlled, Internet-connected speakers. These shifts in consumer behavior have thrown the PC market into free fall. Global shipments dropped 3.9% year-over-year this past quarter, according to research firm IDC. Computer makers like Lenovo and HP have responded by trying to make their PCs more like tablets. Their two-in-one “hybrid” devices can work as both a desktop and a tablet, powered by Microsoft’s touchscreen-friendly Windows 10. There’s evidence the market for these hybrids is is growing. But that hasn’t been enough to stop the bleeding. “The total available market for shipping PCs into the home is getting smaller and smaller,” says IDC analyst Linn Huang. Even in this grim environment, Apple and rival Microsoft aren’t giving up on PCs. Both companies this week unveiled new computers that, taken together, offer a glimpse of what the future holds for desktops and laptops. With Apple’s new MacBook Pro laptop, the standout feature is a touchscreen strip called the Touch Bar. It offers different functionality depending on what app the user has open. Launch iTunes, and you’ll see playback controls. Switch to Safari, and you’ll see a list of your open tabs. The Touch Bar also packs Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner, enabling mobile payments and lightning-fast switching between user accounts. Microsoft’s new Surface Studio, meanwhile, is a behemoth desktop with a built-in hinge that allows it to lie nearly flat. When combined with the firm’s Surface Pen stylus and new Surface Dial control input, the Studio offers an experience more akin to using a drawing desk or an easel than a computer. It’s a bold effort for what is, believe it or not, the four-decade-old firm’s first desktop computer. Taken together, Apple’s new MacBook Pro and Microsoft’s Surface Studio are an acknowledgement of a reality facing PC vendors: Desktops and laptops are increasingly becoming more useful as professional tools than consumer gadgets. That explains the flashy new features: You and I probably don’t need a desktop that folds down to a 20-degree angle, but an architect or graphic artist might. It also justifies their sky-high cost. The MacBook Pros with the Touch Bar start at $1,799, while the Surface Studio will set you back at least $2,999. Those price tags are tough for an everyday user to justify, but professionals might see the machines as an investment if they’re making money by using them. Indeed, while unveiling the new MacBook Pro, Apple pitched its Touch Bar as a boon for video and photo editors, DJs, artists and other creatives. Microsoft’s Surface Studio reveal, meanwhile, was crafted to pitch the computer and Dial accessory as a content creators’ dream. Meanwhile, if you’re a student writing a term paper or a parent uploading pictures to Facebook, you’re probably fine with a tablet or hybrid like an iPad or Surface Pro, or an inexpensive computer like a Chromebook. To be sure, there are other computer makers out there offering mid-range desktops and laptops, mostly running Windows. But Apple and Microsoft at least appear convinced that the PC is for professionals, and speedier processors, sharper screens and better keyboards alone aren’t enough to entice them to buy new computers. (The situation is different for office workers, says IDC’s Huang, who will be long tied to the PC.) All this is important because of Apple and Microsoft’s stature in the technology world. Apple has long been a trendsetter in PCs — the first MacBook Air was a revelation, heralding the age of the ultrabook. Microsoft is a comparatively new player in hardware, but its bold efforts like the Surface Book are attracting well-deserved attention. That said, neither company makes much of their money from desktops and laptops, and that isn’t likely to change. But the computers these two firms produce could very well set the tone for the PCs of the future. That being true, expect plenty more high-powered, feature-packed, very expensive machines.

Developed by multiple brands Buy here Part Segway, part skateboard, the self-balancing scooter—generally known as a hoverboard, even though it doesn’t actually hover—is easily the year’s most viral product, drawing fans like Justin Bieber, Jimmy Fallon and Kendall Jenner. Once someone hops on, the device uses a pair of electric gyroscopes (one under each pad) to balance automatically, allowing users to speed forward, backward and around by slightly shifting their body weight. That enables all kinds of fun stunts, ranging from hallway races to motorized dance routines. Maxx Yellin, co-founder of PhunkeeDuck, one of more than 20 companies making versions of the device, sees larger implications. “It could evolve as a new form of transportation for cities and colleges,” Yellin says (though British authorities recently caused a stir by outlawing their use on public sidewalks and streets). But convenience comes at a cost: prices range from $350 to $1,700, depending on the brand and its features. —Lisa Eadicicco   The Lowline Lab Developed by Dan Barasch and James Ramsey “It’s not like any park you’ve ever seen before,” says Dan Barasch of the Lowline, an abandoned trolley terminal in New York City’s Lower East Side that he and architect James Ramsey are trying to turn into an acre of lush green space, replete with flowering plants and areas to relax in the sun. The key: a “remote skylight” dish system that captures sunlight from surrounding rooftops and funnels it underground via fiber-optic cable; once there, it’s beamed out via reflective dome, enabling plants to grow. To prove the technology works, Barasch and Ramsey opened the Lowline Lab; it’s a prototype version of the final park, which is still several approvals—and $70 million in funding—away from completion. But Barasch, who attracted more than 3,300 backers on Kickstarter, is undeterred. Even forgotten places, he says, can still be used “for public good.” —Julie Shapiro 6SensorLabs’ Nima / $199 Available for preorder at NimaSensor.com For the millions of Americans with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, eating out is often anxiety-ridden—any menu item might contain traces of the protein, which is off-limits. The Nima sensor, which starts shipping early next year, would work to put their minds at ease by allowing them to test any kind of food or drink in as little as two minutes. After a sample is dropped into the well of the device, a proprietary antibody (loaded in a disposable cartridge) mines it for traces of gluten. If they exist, a frowning face lights up; if not, a smile appears. “My hope is that people are going to be able to eat socially” without accidentally getting sick, says Shireen Yates, a 6SensorLabs co-founder who is gluten-sensitive. The firm also hopes to apply its technology to detect other food allergens, including peanuts and dairy. —Alice Park Doppler Labs Here Active Listening Earbuds / $249 Waitlist open at Hereplus.me If you’re stuck somewhere with unbearable noise, you essentially have two options: plug your ears, or leave. But what if you could isolate the most grating sound and mute it? Or just lower the volume, much as you would on a TV? That’s the promise of the Here Active Listening system, a groundbreaking set of earbuds from New York–based Doppler Labs. Unlike hearing aids, which amplify or decrease all noises at once, Here’s processor syncs with a smartphone app, so users can handpick which frequencies they want to filter. That means you could stand on a subway platform and have a normal conversation as a train screeches by, or even tune out a crying baby on a plane. “It’s augmented audio reality,” says Doppler Labs CEO Noah Kraft, who initially developed Here for musicians and concertgoers before pivoting to a general audience. The first earbuds will ship in December. —Alex Fitzpatrick Eko Core (buy here) Developed by Connor Landgraf, Jason Bellet and Tyler Crouch If there is one aspect of medicine that’s more art than science, it’s the way doctors listen to ­heartbeats—­trusting their fallible ears and memory to detect aberrations over time. Not so with Eko Core. Once the $199 smart adapter is attached to a stethoscope, it streams heartbeat data to the cloud so physicians can download it to a smartphone. From there, a companion app can analyze the audio and compare it to previous recordings, which may help doctors detect murmurs, heart-valve abnormalities and other conditions that “our ears are not able to,” says Dr. John Chorba, a cardiologist (and mentor to one of the inventors) who’s leading an Eko trial at the University of California, San Francisco. If the device works as planned—early signs are positive—it could not only improve overall care but also drastically reduce the need for expensive tests like echocardiograms. —Alice Park Microsoft HoloLens Buy here Virtual-reality headsets, like the Oculus Rift, create escapes. Put one on, and you’re suddenly swimming with dolphins or fighting in the Battle of Waterloo. Microsoft’s HoloLens, by contrast, augments reality—overlaying holograms and data onto existing surroundings, so you’re not “confined to the virtual world,” as designer Alex Kipman puts it. Imagine gamers defending their homes from robot invaders, engineers manipulating 3-D models or surgeons following directions “on” the human body. Early tests indicate all are possible. Already the HoloLens is being used by NASA to mimic Mars’ terrain in labs and by medical students to dissect virtual bodies. —Alex Fitzpatrick Banza Chickpea Pasta / $4+ per 8 oz. box Buy here  “When people think of pasta, they almost always think, I ate way too much and now I feel like crap,” says Brian Rudolph. Not so with his brand, which is made from chickpeas instead of wheat. That simple switch—in a recipe perfected over 10 months of trial and error—has yielded a healthy twist on the al dente dinner. Banza, shorthand for garbanzo pasta, has double the protein and four times the fiber of traditional pasta, and far fewer carbs; it’s also gluten-free. And to those who may question how good it tastes, consider the sales. Banza launched in two U.S. stores last year; now it’s in 1,700, including Fairway markets, where it was recently the top-­selling pasta of any kind (including wheat). Now Rudolph and his brother Scott plan to reinvent products like pizza and cereal. “People want to eat better,” he says. “We see Banza as a true replacement, a more filling version of the food people love.” —Mandy Oaklander Juno Developed by Fluidigm It can take a full day to “amplify” DNA, the technical term for making millions of copies of one strain so it can be compared with many others. Juno cuts that process to just three hours, freeing scientists to concentrate on actual ­analysis—a shift that makes it easier to match bone-marrow donors, find cures for genetic diseases and more. The key is Fluidigm’s proprietary microchip, which can amplify samples that are 1,000 times smaller than a drop of water. And the sleek, Yves Béhar–­designed aesthetic doesn’t hurt, either. “We see a lot of possibilities for clinical labs and hospitals,” says Marc Unger, a senior vice president at Fluidigm, of the $120,000 machine, which is now being used at academic and research labs. “We really want to help.” —Alexandra Sifferlin Star Apartments Designed by Michael Maltzan For decades, housing for the homeless has too often meant transient shelters or warehouse-­like abodes. L.A.’s Star Apartments aims to buck that trend by design; it functions more like a minivillage than a single building, says Maltzan of his third collaboration with Skid Row Housing Trust, a local nonprofit. In addition to 102 prefabricated studios, which are ingeniously staggered into four terraced stories, Star Apartments offers a ground-floor medical clinic and, above that, a garden, an outdoor running track and space for classrooms. The goal, says Maltzan, is to make the residents of its 300-sq.-ft. units—who are handpicked by the county department of health ­services—feel “like they’re part of a dynamic and intimate community,” a strategy that can help people, especially those struggling with homelessness and substance-­abuse issues, re-­establish stability in their lives. —Richard Lacayo Safety Truck Developed by Samsung and Leo Burnett Every year, thousands of people get hurt or die in traffic accidents, in part because their visibility gets blocked by a lumbering vehicle. This is especially true in Argentina, known for its winding, narrow roads. There, however, Samsung and ad agency Leo Burnett have partnered on a creative solution: a system that relays video footage from the front of a truck to four screens on its back, giving drivers a clear view of what’s ahead. During its initial test, the Safety Truck covered some 620 miles (1,000 km) over three days without incident. Now Samsung is refining the technology and working with Argentine officials to roll it out more broadly. “We believe this will change the history of road safety,” says Sang Jik Lee, president of Samsung Electronics Argentina. —Julie Shapiro Sproutling / $299 Available for preorder at Sproutling.com “Is my baby O.K.?” That’s the question Sproutling aims to answer—in real time—with its first product. Once in place, the Fitbit-like device can track an infant’s heart rate, body temperature, position and more, and notify parents, via mobile app, if there’s cause for alarm. (Though regular check-ins are still encouraged.) Once it learns a baby’s habits, Sproutling can also offer helpful predictions, like when he or she will wake up from a nap. “We want to get more understanding of how children behave as a whole,” says CEO Chris Bruce, a father of two. “That’s the holy grail.” —Sarah Begley Drone Port Developed by Foster + Partners and Afrotech-EPFL As Amazon, Google and others ramp up their drone-delivery tests, one question looms large: How will their home base function? For hints, the tech titans may well look to Rwanda, where workers will soon break ground on three “drone ports,” designed to make it easier to transport food, medical supplies, electronics, spare parts and other goods through the hilly countryside, where road travel is difficult. The Rwanda project “is a relatively modest beginning,” says Norman Foster, chairman of architecture firm Foster + Partners, which is leading the first phase of construction (scheduled to be completed in 2020). But, he adds, “it could be a catalyst,” helping to solve an array of pressing health issues and creating a model for other countries looking to regulate commercial drone use. —Sarah Begley Thinx / $24+ per pair Available at Shethinx.com For decades, women trying to avoid leaks or stains during menstruation have mainly had to rely on disposable pads, tampons and panty liners, which can be bulky and expensive. “But can’t underwear do the same thing, better?” wondered Miki and Radha Agrawal. That’s the idea behind Thinx, a line of thongs and panties that the twin sisters—alongside co-founder Antonia Dunbar and a team of manufacturers in Sri Lanka—have engineered to (mostly) replace traditional products. Each pair is washable, reusable and equipped with four layers of moisture-wicking, antimicrobial fabric. On heavier days, however, some women may need extra protection. “We always say, Know your flow,” says Miki. —Samantha Grossman Casper Mattress / $500+ Available at Casper.com Buying a new mattress is a lot like purchasing a used car: stressful, confusing and likely to overwhelm you with options. “We want to cut the clutter,” says Philip Krim, CEO of Casper, one of many startups upending the sleep industry, including Leesa and Tuft & Needle. The model is simple: create one mattress style; up the comfort factor (using a mix of foams); set clear prices; and sell it online (cutting costs, so prices remain low). Once the mattress arrives—it’s vacuum-packed in a cardboard box—customers get a 100-day trial period during which they can return it for a full refund. But that rarely happens, says Krim. Casper’s sales are expected to exceed $75 million this year, making it a leader among its startup competitors. —Victor Luckerson Apple Pencil and iPad Pro / $99 and $799+, respectively Buy here  In the 450 years or so since its invention, the pencil has become so ubiquitous, it’s easy to forget how remarkable a technology it is. It can write at any angle. Shades get darker depending on how hard you press. Marks can be erased. Reproducing this functionality digitally has vexed computer engineers for years, which is what makes Apple’s latest effort so impressive. The Pencil allows users to draw, paint or write on a screen, just as they would a sheet of paper. And it works in tandem with the iPad Pro, a tablet faster than roughly 80% of laptops sold in the past year, so there’s no perceptible delay. That combination has already sparked chatter about new ways to create art, animations, blueprints and more. “You can rest your hand anywhere and [the iPad Pro screen] totally ignores it and it just reads the Pencil,” wrote Don Shank, an art director at Pixar, after testing the products in September. “It’s pretty amazing.” —Matt Vella Nike Flyease 8 / $130 Available at Nike.com In 2012, Matthew Walzer, a then high school junior with cerebral palsy, sent a note to Nike: “My dream is to go to the college of my choice,” he wrote, “without having to worry about someone coming to tie my shoes every day.” Sensing an opportunity to create a new footwear category—both for casual consumers who want a simpler way to tie sneakers and for people like Walzer, who need one—Nike dispatched a design team. This year, they unveiled their solution: the Flyease 8, a LeBron James–branded basketball shoe with a one-handed fastening mechanism that drew inspiration from “opening and closing a door,” says Tobie Hatfield, the shoe’s head designer. (To tie the shoe, wearers yank on a strap, which zips around the ankle as they pull.) There are still kinks to work out; pulling the strap too hard or too fast, for example, may cause the zipper to break. But Walzer, now a sophomore at Florida Gulf Coast University, has said the shoes have given him a great “sense of independence and accomplishment.” —Sean Gregory Pantelligent / $199 Available at Pantelligent.com How hot should the pan be? When do I stir? It it done yet? If you’ve ever cooked an unfamiliar dish, chances are you’ve asked yourself one or more of these questions—­and ­Pantelligent aims to answer them all. Once you select a recipe from its smartphone app, the pan uses Bluetooth and a special heat sensor to offer real-time instructions on your screen, so you’ll know exactly when to flip a steak, for example, if you want it medium rare. When they first dreamed up the concept at MIT, Humberto Evans was a great cook, but Mike Robbins could barely fry an egg. Now, according to Evans, his former roommate whips up dishes like chicken piccata. “The food speaks for itself,” he says of how people can use the pans, which started shipping in October. —Samantha Grossman The Drinkable Book Developed by Teri Dankovich An estimated 663 million people globally do not have access to clean drinking water, in part because filtration is complicated and expensive. The Drinkable Book is neither: thanks to a special ­treatment—­developed with a team of scientists over several years—its pages double as water filters, killing over 99% of harmful bacteria during trials in Bangladesh, Ghana and South Africa. (They also list usage instructions.) Though research is still needed to determine whether the system can filter all contaminants, including viruses, Dankovich is optimistic; she says she is talking to partners who could help fund more testing and, eventually, large-scale production. —Sarah Begley The Ocean Cleanup Project Developed by Boyan Slat There’s a glut of plastic trash in the middle of the Pacific Ocean that’s bigger than Texas—and growing. But the default removal process of chasing it with nets is both costly and time-­consuming. Instead, the Ocean Cleanup Project proposes a 62-mile-long (100 km) floating boom—at an estimated cost of $15 million—that would use natural currents to trap trash. (Its net drops roughly 10 ft., or 3 m, below the surface, shallow enough for fish to swim around.) If next year’s trials succeed, a full cleanup operation would aim to start in 2020; internal estimates suggest it could reduce the trash by 42% over 10 years. —Bryan Walsh TZOA Environmental Tracker / $139 Available for preorder at Tzoa.com In order to avoid potentially harmful pollutants and allergens, it helps to know about the air you’re breathing. That’s where Tzoa comes in. The stationary device, developed by electrician Kevin R. Hart, uses sensors to evaluate the atmosphere in any given area—­measuring factors like temperature, particulate matter (dust, pollen, mold, car exhaust) and UV ­exposure—and uploads that data to the cloud, so that institutions like Johns Hopkins can conduct air-­quality research. The company plans to launch wearable versions in May that offer a similar service, allowing consumers to chart specific walking routes, for example, if they want to avoid pockets of pollen. —Alexandra Sifferlin Hackaball / $85 Available for preorder at Hackaball.com At a time when demand for computer scientists is skyrocketing, most Americans get little or no exposure to coding during their formative years. Made by Many, a New York City–based digital-­consulting firm, is trying to change that. Its Hackaball toy syncs with a mobile app, allowing users to program how and when it lights up—and then to see how those programs affect their lives in the real world. During one test, for example, kids set the ball to change colors at random intervals, then used it to play a hot-potato-style game. Enabling social ­scenarios—rather than a more isolated, screen-based introduction to ­coding—is the point of Hackaball, says William Owen, a strategy director at Made by Many. Its concept appears to be resonating: some 2,800 people backed the project on Kickstarter, raising $240,000. The first units ship in January. —Lisa Eadicicco Google Cardboard / Price varies Available DIY or from third-party sellers  Most of the hype surrounding virtual reality has rightly centered on premium headsets, such as the forthcoming Oculus Rift and HTC Vive (both of which will likely cost several hundred dollars). But Google Cardboard is revolutionary in its own right. Since its 2014 debut, the scrappy viewer—which can be built from scratch using free online instructions and relies on your smartphone screen for visuals—has emerged as a playground for virtual reality, priming brands and consumers alike for one of the world’s most anticipated technologies. There are Cardboard apps that let people drive cars (from Mercedes-Benz), attend concerts (from musician Jack White) and even play immersive video games. “We ask people, ‘Hey, put your smartphone in this piece of cardboard. It’s going to do something amazing,’” says Clay Bavor, a Google VP who oversees VR projects. “And then it does, and they’re shocked.” —Alex Fitzpatrick   Artiphon Instrument 1 / $399 Available for preorder at Artiphon.com An estimated 70% of adults want to play an instrument on a regular basis, but only 5% actually do, partly because it’s tough to choose just one to master. That’s not an issue with the Artiphon, which can mimic dozens of ­instruments—not just how they sound but also how they’re played. It can be strummed like a guitar or tapped like a piano. Or it can mix and match inputs, allowing users to bang banjo chords as if they were drumming. “We’re trying to pave a different path toward musical creativity,” says Jacob Gordon, an Artiphon co-founder, of the device (and its companion smartphone app), which raised $1.3 million on Kickstarter. —Victor Luckerson Tesla Model X / est. $130,000 Available 2016 Tesla’s Model X, unveiled in September, marks a leap toward a reality in which electric cars aren’t simply exotic, but just as useful as their competition. The world’s first luxury electric SUV can go 250 miles on a charge, Tesla says, and haul seven passengers. It features futuristic back doors that open like the wings of a bird (up, not out). And the Model X is a blast to drive: it can hit 60 m.p.h. from a standstill in 3.2 seconds, and its battery pack gives it a low center of gravity, enabling sports-car-like handling. (That’s rare for any SUV, let alone one that runs on clean power.) For Tesla, more than one model is at stake. As CEO Elon Musk put it during the Model X unveiling: people need to know “that any kind of car can go electric.” —Matt Vella CogniToys Dino / $120 Buy here  Rather than repeating catchphrases, as “talking” toys have done for generations, this dinosaur taps IBM’s Watson technology to engage with kids ages 5 to 9 in a meaningful way. In addition to answering plain-language queries (like “How far away is the moon?”), the wi-fi-enabled figurine talks back and learns from kids’ responses—helping them hone their math skills, for example, by asking harder questions once they nail, “What is 2+2?” and “Can you count to 10?” The trick, according to CogniToys CEO Donald Coolidge, is to make educational development seem like a “cool, fun experience.” “That’s kind of the best toy possible,” he says. —Sarah Begley Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3594971/the-25-best-inventions-of-2014/", "http://time.com/4054615/tesla-model-x-watch-live/"], "sentiment_score": 0.13809323843031707, "subjectivity_score": 0.4479135814248177},
{"type": "article", "header": "I Watched the Democratic Debate in Virtual Reality", "author": "Alex Fitzpatrick", "update_date/publish_date": "October 13, 2015 9:13 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4072485/democratic-debate-virtual-reality-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/", "text": "(LAS VEGAS, NEV. SORT OF.) — It turns out I have exactly the same tolerance for virtual reality as I do for presidential debates: After about 30 minutes, I get vaguely nauseous and have to step away. Tuesday’s Democratic Debate, sponsored by CNN and Facebook and hosted at Las Vegas’ Wynn hotel and casino, was available to viewers in several different forms: On TV, over the Internet, and, yes, in virtual reality (VR). Watching Hillary Clinton square off with Bernie Sanders and the rest in VR was free, but required a special Samsung headset. A special Samsung headset I happened to have sitting around my apartment. So I figured, why not tune in? Streaming Tuesday’s debate in VR was CNN’s latest high-tech hijink, a follow-up to its oft-mocked experiments with “holograms” back in 2008. The operation used multiple cameras with a viewing angle of about 180°, offering close-up views of the candidates, the crowd, and yes, of course, Anderson Cooper. I couldn’t pick which viewpoint I wanted at any given time, but the vantages were more free than TV’s tightly framed shots, letting me shift my gaze from Clinton to Sanders to whoever else those other people were at will, just like being in the front row at the Wynn. It was engrossing, if limited by my headset’s less-than-stellar resolution. Eventually, that’s what got me to head back to good ol’ TV: I could sort of tell the difference between the candidates, but the graphics were so poor they looked more like faceless avatars than human beings. So is VR the future of television? Not even close. Virtual reality’s biggest problem is that it’s isolating. Watching Tuesday’s debate with a clunky headset strapped to my face meant I couldn’t share the experience with my real-world friends — or make awful jokes on Twitter all night with my online ones. VR is lonely, and TV is best when it’s social. (Another use case may lie in live sports. Especially those better in person than on TV. I’m looking at you, hockey.) What’s more, CNN’s debate wasn’t really true VR. There are two flavors of virtual reality. The first involves using a special camera to record wide-angle video of a live event, then beaming that content to viewers’ headsets. Like I did Tuesday night, viewers can then look around at whatever they want. It’s novel for a minute, but you quickly find your gaze locked at whatever the producer or director would have put in frame anyway. This approach is basically taking video as we know it today and slapping it onto a new medium. That’s boring. It’s what we’ve done time and time again when new platforms arise: It feels like online publishers are only just recently tapping into the unique powers of the Internet, for instance, rather than treating it like a dumping ground for stuff that looks a lot like old-school print or video content. VR television will be like 3D TV: A decent enough idea on paper, but never a commercial hit. But that doesn’t mean VR won’t be a thing. Far from it. Where virtual reality shines is in experiences built from the ground up for the new medium. One VR demo I’ve tried turned me into a deep sea diver; I met a gigantic blue whale that really did feel alive. Another was essentially Microsoft Paint but in three dimensions, creating a new artistic medium altogether. And a third put me on a skyscraper’s ledge with such a convincing level of danger that my brain reflexively told my feet to back up, you idiot, lest I plunge to an untimely demise. There’s yet another VR experience, however, that’s more predictive of where the industry is headed. Oculus Story Studio, the content wing of a leading VR hardware company, is making experimental and Pixar-worthy short films for the new medium (Indeed, it counts several Pixar veterans among its staff). The job is harder that it sounds. One lesson the team has learned, for example, is that straight cuts, a staple in filmmakers’ toolkits, are far too jarring for VR. That seems minor, but it underscores how content creators will have to think up entirely new ways of storytelling that jive with VR’s capabilities — and its limitations. We’re coming up on a make-or-break year for virtual reality. VR headsets, previously meant only for hardcore hobbyists, are soon hitting store shelves at reasonable prices. (The Samsung unit I have is $99, plus the cost of a phone that doubles as the screen.) With the hardware more accessible, the technology’s future lies in content. Will consumers find a reason to buy in? That’s up to the creators out there — but livestreamed political debates seen at low resolutions won’t cut it.    Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.10537769192832484, "subjectivity_score": 0.4565311797906733},

The news is momentous—and also a little confusing. The question now is, why? That Google is no longer just a search company has been evident for a long while. Though its mission has always famously been to organize all the world’s information, the company has increasingly gotten into more and more disparate lines of business—when new ventures were businesses at all, that is. Beyond selling ads against searches—it’s core moneymaking venture—Google is making driverless cars, beaming Internet signals from giant balloons, delivering high-speed Internet access, redefining television, making phones, and even trying to cure (or significantly delay) death. When such ventures might actually turn a profit, however, has been a consistent, nagging question. At best, some will never turn into big money makers and others will take decades to do so—at a significant drain of financial resources. Over the past decade, technology investors have gotten significantly more comfortable bullying big companies, no matter how profitable, which they deem lacking focus. Once untouchable firms like Apple and Microsoft have, for instance, been egged into giving up board seats or instituting investor-enriching stock buyback programs as a result. Google’s move will, presumably, insulate Alphabet from such meddling. What’s more, search and the ads sold against it, have come under increasing pressure. The business is still a behemoth: Google brought in $16.2 billion in ad revenue for quarter ended June 30 2015, up 11% year-over-year. But the shift to mobile has caused some observers to wonder about the company’s future rate of prosperity. As Internet users abandon desktop computers and flock to mobile devices, search results become harder to monetize, either because there’s less screen real estate or because users are searching in distinct apps rather than on the open web. Google’s dominant position with its Android mobile operating system is a hedge against such concerns, though not a panacea exactly. Read more Read TIME’s 2013 cover story, ‘Google vs. Death’ The birth of Alphabet is likely to be analyzed for years to come as a corporate tactic, as a management maneuver, as pure theater. At first blush the “why” is fairly straightforward: Pichai’s Google will be freed up to focus on finding ways to better monetize the mobile explosion; Alphabet will be liberated to think different (and bigger, way bigger). In the near-term, Google itself will probably look a lot like YouTube has over the past several years: a mostly independent company with its own CEO operating inside a much larger organization. The more interesting and as of yet unanswered question is “what is Alphabet?” That question may take years to answer.

{"type": "article", "header": "The Ultimate Apple MacBook Buyer’s Guide", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "November 22, 2016 12:52 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4576469/macbook-apple-buyers-guide-which-one-buy-pro-air-ipad/", "text": "Buying a new Apple laptop isn’t as simple as deciding between an Air or a Pro anymore. Apple recently added three new MacBook Pros to its lineup, making the company’s notebook selection more diverse than ever. There’s the feature-packed new Pros, the still-worthwhile old Pros, the critic-favorite MacBook Air, and the ultra-portable 12-inch MacBook. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro is increasingly a worthy laptop replacement. So which MacBook is right for you? Here’s a breakdown of how Apple’s laptops compare that can help you make a decision, whether you’re buying for yourself or a loved one: MacBook Pro  The MacBook Pro is generally a better choice for shoppers who plan to use their laptop for more than just basic word processing and web browsing. Professionals using processor-intensive software like Adobe Photoshop or Final Cut Pro may need the snappier performance the Pro offers. No matter which Pro model you choose, you’ll be getting a speedier processor, an option to add more memory (15-inch Pro models only come with the 16GB memory option, double that of the Air), and a sharper screen than the Air. Apple now offers several Pro laptops to choose from: the new Touch Bar-enabled version (starting at $1,799 for 13-inch, $2,399 for 15-inch), a similar new Pro without the Touch Bar (starting at $1,499 and only available in 13-inch), and last year’s MacBook Pro (starting at $1,299 for 13-inch, $1,999 for 15-inch.) Choosing Between the 2016 vs. 2015 MacBook Pro The previous MacBook Pro is a solid option for those looking to save some cash but also need more horsepower than the Air can provide. It’s $200 cheaper than the new non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro, and offers a brilliantly sharp screen, great battery life, and plenty of power. Still, the 2016 edition is probably a better choice for most people, unless you’re on a tight budget and really can’t get by with an Air. Nearly everything on the new MacBook Pro has been at least slightly improved, with faster performance, a thinner and lighter body, a more colorful screen and larger touchpad. But most importantly, going with the 2016 model and its newer processor helps future-proof you, ensuring your laptop won’t get outdated as quickly. That alone could be worth the extra $200. There are other trade-offs to consider here as well. The new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar only comes with 2 USB-C ports, whereas the previous generation Pro includes two USB 3 ports, an SD card slot, an HDMI port, and a MagSafe charging slot. Translation? If you buy the new model, you’ll also probably have to spend extra cash on adapters to keep using older, non-USB-C accessories, like external monitors, camera card readers and so on. (USB-C is quickly becoming the standard, but we’re in the middle of a dongle-ridden transition period.) Choosing Between Touch Bar vs. Non-Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro The new MacBook Pro’s biggest update is the Touch Bar, a touchscreen strip that sits just above the keyboard and replaces the standard function keys. The Touch Bar adds some convenience by displaying different buttons as you need them: If you’re sending an email through Apple’s Mail app, the Touch Bar may show keys for formatting text or transferring messages to folders. But when you’re watching a video in Safari, it may include a slider for scrubbing through footage. The Touch Bar-enabled MacBook also has a faster processor, but the difference may not be noticeable enough to influence a buying decision. The Touch Bar is an intriguing concept that’s occasionally helpful, but for most people, it’s not enough to justify spending an extra $300. A far more useful addition is the Touch ID sensor embedded in the power button, which makes it possible to quickly log into your account, switch between user accounts, and shop with Apple Pay in Safari. Still, $300 is a steep cost for features that are more convenient than necessary, but if you’re intrigued by the Touch Bar, the boosted specs could make that cost worthwhile. It’s also worth noting that if you want a 2016 MacBook Pro in the 15-inch size, which includes more powerful graphics and a bigger trackpad, you’ll have to opt for the Touch Bar version. The only other 15-inch MacBook Pro option is last year’s model. MacBook Air The MacBook Air, starting at $999 and only available new in a 13-inch size, is now the cheapest option in Apple’s laptop lineup. With its long battery life, lightweight design, and solid performance, it’s still the best option for most people. But the question is: For how long will that be true? During Apple’s most recent Mac event, the company gave no indication that it plans to update the Air any further. Buying the Air may make sense now, but if Apple doesn’t upgrade it soon, that advice may change. There are a few other drawbacks to consider about the MacBook Air. Most notably, its screen isn’t nearly as sharp as that on the MacBook Pro or 12-inch MacBook models. It also doesn’t include the improvements Apple has added to its more modern laptops, like the Force Touch trackpad and flatter keyboard (although the Air’s older keyboard is fantastic, perhaps even better.) The Air offers more variety than Apple’s newer notebooks in terms of ports (two USB 3, one Thunderbolt 2, and an SD card slot), which means most buyers won’t need to purchase extra dongles to use multiple peripherals or charge their phone while using an accessory. But it doesn’t include any USB-C ports, a factor that may limit its usefulness in the future. For the price, the MacBook Air still offers enough computing prowess to meet basic needs without getting overwhelmed. Those seeking an ultralight laptop primarily for browsing the web, word processing, viewing photos, and streaming media will be satisfied with the Air. Its light weight and long-lasting battery make it particularly great for frequent travelers. All told, the MacBook Air is best for buyers in search of an Apple laptop with more power than the 12-inch MacBook that won’t cost as much as a Pro. MacBook (12-inch)  Apple’s 12-inch MacBook is its most portable and slimmest laptop, but it’s also very expensive for the level of performance it provides, starting at $1,299. Unlike Apple’s other laptops, the MacBook runs on one of Intel’s less powerful Core M processors, rather than its Core I lineup. These processors are designed to generate less heat, helping companies like Apple and others make extremely thin and light fan-less computers. This advantage is especially evident in the 12-inch MacBook, which is elegantly designed and highly portable. Carrying around the notebook, which weighs just over two pounds, feels more like toting around an iPad. It also includes a gorgeous screen as well as Apple’s new butterfly mechanism keyboard and Force Touch trackpad, similar to those on the latest MacBook Pro models. With its less powerful processor, Apple’s 12-inch MacBook is mainly targeted at casual computer users looking for a highly portable laptop for browsing the web, working on documents and so on. But the Air is a better choice for most people. It’s cheaper, more powerful, and offers longer battery life than its 12-inch cousin. Plus, the 12-inch MacBook only comes with one USB-C port, which can be a nightmare if you have lots of accessories. Unless you truly need a lightweight laptop with an ultra-crisp display that’s smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air, the 12-inch model isn’t the best value. What About iPads? If portability and screen resolution are important to you, it’s worth your time to consider Apple’s iPad Pro as well. The smaller and more manageable 9.7-inch size starts at $599, and Apple sells its keyboard case separately for $149. That means for $850 — roughly $450 cheaper than the entry level 12-inch MacBook — you can get a 128GB 9.7-inch iPad Pro with Apple’s keyboard case. There are major differences to consider, though. Most notably, the iPad Pro runs on iOS rather than macOS, so you’re not getting a full desktop experience. Nor does the iPad Pro include any ports other than its Lightning charging slot and a headphone jack. Its official keyboard accessory, meanwhile, isn’t as sturdy as the keyboards on Apple’s laptops. But it may be worth a look if you want something more affordable that’s easy to carry around for jotting down notes, watching Netflix and doing some light photo or video editing.

In many ways, the 12.9-inch tablet was an engineering and computing marvel — and a significant step for Apple. The first iPad truly built for productivity, it was an important addition to Apple’s lineup as rivals like Microsoft and Google introduced new, more capable tablets. At the same time, the iPad Pro was confusing. Its gargantuan screen, albeit gorgeous, was just so large. I didn’t know if it should be held in landscape or portrait mode, if I should rest it on my desk or in my lap. I wasn’t sure of any situations in which I’d use a device like this, rather than a MacBook or regular iPad. Thankfully, Apple has now brought the iPad Pro’s power to a smaller, 9.7-inch size. The new iPad Pro (the larger and smaller devices share the same name) starts at $599, and will be available in stores on March 31. The new tablet is the same size and weight as Apple’s iPad Air 2, but with the iPad Pro’s capabilities. Compatible with the company’s Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, the new iPad Pro runs on its A9X processor, which Apple says makes it as powerful as most laptops. An improved screen, better speakers and a new rose gold color option are here as well. All told, it’s a powerful tablet packed into a far more manageable form factor. The smaller iPad Pro is similar in many ways to its larger sibling. But Apple has made one new feature exclusive to the smaller model: “True Tone,” which adjusts the device’s screen to match the lighting in your environment. While the screen may not look obviously different at first glance, the change was noticeable when I compared the new Pro alongside the $399 iPad Air 2 and Google’s $499 10.2-inch Pixel C tablet. TIME.com’s white backdrop looked bluish on the latter two tablets compared to the iPad Pro, while the refined white balance on the Pro made text look more crisp. True Tone made browsing websites and reading books more enjoyable on the iPad Pro. But with other visuals, I didn’t notice much of a difference between the Pro and the Air 2. I only occasionally spotted disparities when comparing the tablets side-by-side. The red Marvel logo in the Captain America: Civil War trailer, for instance, looked slightly bolder on the Pro than the Air 2 and Pixel C. Skin tone looked richer and more accurate, too. But the overall scene wasn’t dramatically different than what I had viewed on the other tablets. This is probably more important for things like photo and video editing rather than casual entertainment. I did, however, notice that the iPad Pro’s screen looked excessively bright compared to the Pixel C and Air 2. Those who frequently watch movies and TV shows on or blast songs from their iPads will appreciate the iPad Pro’s speaker system. The new 9.7-inch tablet packs a four-speaker audio setup capable of emitting loud, full-bodied audio just like the larger Pro model. Music from the Air 2 and Google Pixel C, which both have two speakers instead of four, sounded shallow in comparison. Apple sums up the iPad Pro in two words on its website: “Super computer,” suggesting it’s meant to be more powerful than your average tablet. In my experience, the Pro’s A9X chip offered modest performance improvements over the Air 2’s A8X processor. The iPad Pro appears to be moving at a slightly faster pace all around. It was able to launch games, apps, and its camera a bit more quickly than the Air 2 or Pixel C. The iPad Pro has great battery life, too. About a day and a half into my testing, I still had roughly 50% in the tank. That was after I used the tablet sporadically throughout the workday to take notes, watch Netflix, sketch, and check social media. Battery life varies depending on how you use the device, though, so if your iPad is constantly lighting up with notifications, you might get less mileage. It’s the accessories that really set the iPad Pro apart from Apple’s other tablets. Apple’s 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch Pro models are the only tablets that work with its Apple Pencil stylus and its Smart Keyboard. Both products are meant to offer users new ways to interact with their devices. The Apple Pencil is designed to replicate the experience of writing on paper on a digital screen. Tilting it sideways while coloring, for instance, allows you to shade. A harder press results in bolder handwriting or sketches. From note-taking to graphic design apps, lots of software is already compatible with the Apple Pencil. It’s far from a necessity at $99, but illustrators and other creatives may feel differently. Apple’s sleek $149 Smart Keyboard nearly passes for one of Apple’s regular iPad covers. They look almost identical from afar, but there’s a sleek keyboard tucked inside. That makes it an ideal choice for anyone who wants an iPad keyboard without too much bulk. Typing on it is comfortable, but not the best experience I’ve had with a tablet keyboard accessory. I prefer the sturdier and less expensive keyboard cover Microsoft made for its Surface Pro 3 and 4 models. Google’s keyboard for the Pixel C is also firmer, but feels heavier and packs fewer keys. Overall, the new iPad Pro is Apple’s most capable iPad yet. Its size makes it a more attractive choice for most than the hulking 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Although Apple has made some worthwhile enhancements, most shoppers won’t notice much of a difference between the $399 Air 2 and the $599 Pro in everyday use. To get the full iPad Pro experience, you really need to try it with the Apple Pencil, which tacks on an extra $99. At that point, you’re spending around $700 for the 32GB Pro and Pencil, when you could get a slightly dated iPad Air 2 with twice as much storage for about $500. Illustrators and graphic artists may be eager to take advantage of everything the Apple Pencil has to offer, but the everyday consumer might not find much use for it. Those interested in using their iPad for productivity can also pair a third-party keyboard, like the ones made by Zagg and Logitech, with a cheaper tablet to get a similar experience. The iPad Pro is a gorgeous and powerful tablet that certainly won’t disappoint, but as is the case with most Apple products, it will not be the least expensive option available. 4 out of 5 Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4113160/ipad-pro-review/"], "sentiment_score": 0.17256455665546572, "subjectivity_score": 0.4843829441731542},

And no, it wasn’t the Apple Watch. (Though you ought to read my initial review of that device here.) The company announced a new laptop, which it calls simply MacBook, that looks more like a MacBook Air that went on a diet. How slim, you ask? It measures just 13.1 millimeters at its thickest point, and weighs in at a mere 2.03 pounds. And then you put your hands on it and realize. Gosh, it’s small. Incredibly small. Unbelievably small. I repeated a similar phrase during the keynote that introduced it, which I live-blogged for this very publication. It’s easy to think dwell on size when the device is the sole item on a sweeping black stage. It’s another thing to walk into Apple’s demo area, lay your eyes on the sold, silver, and grey varieties, and think the same thing all over again. Apple’s new MacBook is indeed all-new, and it’s a complete overhaul of the device, from components on out. It lacks fans of any sort and relies on an energy-efficient Intel Core M processor to keep it cool and prolong battery life, which Apple claims lasts an entire day. Its screen, the so-called high-resolution Retina display, measures 12 inches on the diagonal, situating the new laptop in between Apple’s two models of MacBook Air, at 11 inches and 13 inches. The difference: That Retina display packs 2304 pixels across by 1440 pixels down into that diminutive picture. Each key features a new “butterfly mechanism” that provides for a unique typing experience. It’s one that I struggled with during my hands-on time with the new MacBook. It’s not that the keys are hard to press, or even awkwardly placed. If anything, the keys are almost too easy to press. A touch-typist will fall in love with it after just a few minutes of tapping away. Others will take long to adjust to a keyboard that stretches to the very edges of the MacBook’s housing. I’m in the latter camp. A new trackpad offers the same “Force Touch” technology found in the Apple Watch. Push past the marketing and you’ll find a trackpad that doesn’t move when pressed, no matter how hard you do so. (Well, within reason—don’t shove the thing off a table.) Its immobility allows it to differentiate between amounts of pressure, and by extension, intent to accomplish different tasks. For example, moving the mouse pointer over a file icon and Force Touching on the trackpad prompts Quick Preview to open. See an address in an e-mail? Force Touch on it and a dialogue box with Apple Maps appears to reveal its exact location. Similar shortcuts are present throughout the updated Mac OS X operating system. You can adjust the degree of pressure in the System Preferences area. And try as I might on the floor of the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco, I still couldn’t believe that the new MacBook’s trackpad wasn’t actually moving. Apple assured me it’s not. The “Taptic Engine” underneath the aluminum pad leaves the user with the impression that it’s traveling in space. Color me impressed—or confused. There is a notable lack of ports on the new MacBook. In fact, there’s only one. (Well, two if you want to make the argument a headphone-jack is a port.) On its left flank is a USB Type-C port. Think of it as the more capable, younger sibling of the Lightning adapter on your iOS device. Through this single port you can charge the MacBook, transfer content, and connect it to an external monitor. It’s the Swiss Army Knife of connectors, though for now at least, external monitor functionality will require a series of adapters. Why? USB Type-C is a new standard—one that most accessory manufacturers have yet to fully commit to, let alone release products with it incorporated. So for now, adapters will be a necessity for MacBook owners. As someone who works primarily from an iPad, I can’t complain about the lack of ports. For me, adapters are a way of life and something I’ve come to accept. But that’s not for everyone, and Apple’s minimalism will be a break in how we’ve come to think about the desktop/laptop computer. I asked several attendees at the Apple event what they thought about this issue; reactions ranged from excited to discouraged. (The concerns of the latter group: what’s the point of ultraportability if I need to carry around a bunch of adapters? Fair point.) That Apple’s adapters are priced as high as $79 won’t help. But back to the new MacBook. Its Intel M Core processors clock in at a lowly 1.1GHz and 1.2GHz respectively, which is cause for concern. I wasn’t able to fully test either version outside of Apple’s demo area, unfortunately, so I can’t comment on their overall performance. I can say that during the limited time I used the new MacBook—to watch videos, browse through a Photos library, and accomplish other miscellaneous tasks—I was left with the impression that comparatively slow processors wouldn’t adversely impact performance too much. But that’s not the real point. Apple’s new MacBook is transformative based on its size alone. To put it into perspective, the new MacBook is only slightly heavier (and far thinner) than my iPad-plus-keyboard setup, but it’s a full-fledged content creation device. Which has me, and I suspect many other people, wondering: Laptop. Tablet. Now what? Jason Cipriani is Fortune’s personal technology columnist and the author of its weekly “Logged In” column.

All I wanted to do was save a few videos onto my iPad for a presentation. But, already, I’m getting ahead of myself. A few days ago, I downloaded the Mac OS X 10.10.3 Beta, Apple’s not-yet-ready for launch operating system. It packs many improvements, the most noteworthy being an entirely revamped photo managing interface. Gone is Apple’s multi-prong photo solution that included Aperture for the experts and iPhoto for the rest of us. In its place is a new Photos app, which takes many a nod from its iOS counterpart. Upon first glance, the new Mac Photos app is an enormous improvement when it comes to handling massive amounts of images. And let’s face it, after six generations of iPhones, with high-quality DSLRs and action-cams aplenty, most of us have more pictures than we’ll ever need, let alone look at again. I personally have more than 15,000 in my library. This app makes you fall in love with your forgotten photos all over again. Using the Mac’s touchpad, you can pinch and spread your fingers to zoom out and in on your images, respectively, just as you would if you were browsing your photos on an iOS device. The most impressive part of the interface is how it renders your pictures instantly, turning icon-sized images into full-fledged photos in a snap. But as with any update, I had this nagging feeling that Photos somehow didn’t have all my pictures in it. I couldn’t think of anything I was necessarily missing (and truth be told, I had excised a chunk of about seven years from my cache), though it didn’t seem possible that Photos could be this good at displaying, reordering, and resizing all 15,000 of my memories at once. But without any specific photo missing, I just shrugged and moved on. Fast forward to a couple of days later, and I’m trying to save a few Dropcam videos onto my iPad to show during a presentation. While these movies can be viewed within the Dropcam app, it’s never safe to assume there will be functional Wi-Fi when you’re giving a presentation, so I decided to save them to my device. But that wasn’t possible through the Dropcam app, so I had to save them using Safari on my Mac. Then I figured I’d import them onto my iPad using Photos. (Dropcam engineers: Note, while it’s possible to share these videos and download them on other devices, it’s not possible to save them direct to an iOS device. Please fix this.) It was at this point when I noticed the current pitfalls of Apple’s new Photos app. With my iPad plugged into my Mac, I scrolled through my photos, realizing these were not the photos on my iPad. In fact, there was no mention of my tablet on the user interface. I clicked on the app’s various tabs, and finally came across my iPad’s library when I clicked on the “Import” button. But the only thing that would let me do was copy the images on my iPad onto my computer — so that’s what I did, requesting they be deleted from the device once uploaded. That actually never happened; my iPad still has the images on it, even though they were imported to my Mac’s photo library. I clicked on Photo’s “help” menu, and navigated down to the “Photos Quick Tour” option, only to discover that it’s “coming soon.” This is understandable for a beta app, if still disappointing. And it was then that I realized what was missing between Photos and iPhoto: a sidebar. One reason Photos seems so slick and fluid is that it looks like an iOS app: simple, single-screened, and singularly focused on displaying your images. iPhoto, for all its clunky faults, had a file manager-like sidebar that allowed users to make albums, drag-to-copy photos, and quickly navigate to file formats like videos or the last batch imported. As Photos’ first glance turned into stone-cold reality, it seemed like the new app had forsaken all of these crucial features. After a few more seconds of poking through the app’s menus, I was relieved to see that Apple included a sidebar after all — it’s just turned off by default. Relieved, and ready to love Photos again, I dragged my videos onto the iPad icon only to — wait, this can’t be! — the app wouldn’t copy my video onto my iPad. More web-based troubleshooting ensued, and I discovered that to save a video onto your iPad, you have to use iTunes, Apple’s music app which is mostly used for buying songs, apps and movies. Think about that sentence for a moment, and maybe give it another read if you need to. And what’s worse, once you’re in iTunes, you select your iPad and then the Photos setting to import your video. (Also, once videos are copied to the tablet, they don’t appear in the Videos app — they are placed into the Photos app, mixed in with your pictures.) It’s so disheartening to be critical of Apple’s new Photos app, especially when iPhoto is so outmoded that it needed to go to pasture years ago. But this experience, while mixed, shows how much further Apple has to go before it untangles the knot introduced by its two distinct operating systems. Technologies like Yosemite’s Continuity show the potential of a realm in which all Apple devices work in harmony, but the reality, once you start using it, is still a lot of discord. Hopefully Apple’s Photos app will be more polished when it’s released to the public, expected to happen in the next few months.

Alphabet will become the publicly-traded entity, Page said. Current holders of Google stock will see their shares automatically converted into shares of Alphabet.

Google VP of Products Sundar Pichai will take over as Google’s CEO. MORE: Read TIME’s 2013 cover story, ‘Google vs. Death’   Here’s more from Page: What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and Calico (focused on longevity). Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related. Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. We’ll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we’ll determine their compensation. In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole.

{"type": "article", "header": "The 25 Best Inventions of 2014", "author": "TIME Staff", "update_date/publish_date": "November 20, 2014 5:59 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/3594971/the-25-best-inventions-of-2014/", "text": "—Welcome to TIME’s annual round-up of the best inventions making the world better, smarter and—in some cases—a little more fun.   Hendo Hoverboard / $10,000 Preorder at hendohover.com The hoverboard—a type of skateboard that levitates like a magic carpet—had been a pipe dream since its fictional debut in 1989’s Back to the Future Part II. Now California-based tech firm Hendo has built the real thing. Granted, there are caveats. Hendo’s hoverboard can float only an inch or so above the ground, and even then only over conductive material like copper or aluminum. Just 10 are being made to order (so far). And battery life is 15 minutes—barely enough time to zoom past your enemies à la Marty McFly. But the technology that powers it could be revolutionary. Using the $450,000-plus it raised on Kickstarter, Hendo founders Jill and Greg Henderson plan to develop magnetic “hovering” tech to stabilize buildings during earthquakes, protect valuable works of art and more. “The hoverboard is the first step to bringing this technology to the world,” says Greg. Mangalyaan Developed by the Indian Space Research Organization Nobody gets Mars right on the first try. The U.S. didn’t, Russia didn’t, the Europeans didn’t. But on Sept. 24, India did. That’s when the Mangalyaan (Mars craft in Hindi) went into orbit around the Red Planet, a technological feat no other Asian nation has yet achieved. Building the craft cost India just $74 million, less than the budget for the film Gravity. At that price, the Mangalyaan is equipped with just five onboard instruments that allow it to do simple tasks like measure Martian methane and surface composition. More important, however, it allows India to flex its interplanetary muscles, which portends great things for the country’s space program—and for science in general. High-beta fusion reactor Developed by Lockheed Martin Nuclear fusion—the production of energy from the fusion of hydrogen nuclei—has always been the holy grail of energy: it’s endlessly productive and largely clean—and so far, it’s remained elusive. But in October, Lockheed Martin said it had achieved a technological breakthrough that will enable it to make compact fusion reactors small enough to fit on the back of a truck within a decade. The design uses “magnetic mirror confinement” to control the reaction. Absent further details on how it works, some outside scientists are skeptical. But if Lockheed really can produce a workable fusion reactor, the world of energy may never be the same. Witricity In development for Toyota cars, Intel PCs and more We already have wireless Internet and wireless phones. Why, then, are everyday appliances still shackled to the wall? To be sure, there are a few power-mat chargers for small gadgets like phones. But WiTricity, based in Watertown, Mass., is thinking big. Its technology—involving a plug-in coil that creates a magnetic field, which in turn powers objects as far away as 8 ft. (2.4 m)—has been tested on Toyota electric cars (with charging mats), Intel PCs (with charging pads) and more. Within 10 years, says CEO Alex Gruzen, rooms could be wired so that all appliances—lamps, TVs, stereos—pull power from a central charging base. A machine that can build any object. It sounds like a sci-fi fantasy, but thanks to the rise of 3-D printers—devices that can build objects from digital blueprints, usually by layering plastic or other materials—it is rapidly becoming reality. That’s a boon for consumers and corporations alike. In the past year alone, middle-school students have 3-D-printed stock cars for physics lessons, scientists have 3-D-printed tissues for human organs, and GE has used 3-D printing to improve the efficiency of its jet engines. “This is one of those technologies that literally touches everything we do,” says Avi Reichental, CEO of 3D Systems, whose 3-D printers produce candy (as shown above) and musical instruments, among other objects. Apple Watch / $349+ Buy here Most smart watches have proved to be anything but: they try to shrink down the experience of using a cell phone, with clunky results. Apple’s Watch, by contrast, wholly reimagines the computer for the wrist, using a novel interface that combines a touchscreen and physical buttons. Besides telling time, the Watch can send messages, give directions, track fitness and make wireless payments. It’s also an attractive piece of fashion, with high-end Edition models that feature 18-karat gold. “Apple poured its heart and soul into the design,” says Robert Brunner, founder of San Francisco design studio Ammunition and a former director of industrial design at Apple. “It’s brave because they’re venturing into unknown territory.” Blackphone / $629 Buy here  Nearly half of Americans don’t feel safe sharing private information over a cell-phone call, according to Pew. So how can phone owners conceal their data? Enter the Blackphone, a smartphone designed to put privacy above all else. The device, developed by the company of the same name and accelerated after the Snowden leaks, runs a customized Android operating system stripped of features that might make data vulnerable, like calendar sync. It also comes with software that encrypts calls, texts and browsing history at levels far beyond normal smartphones (which could make the Blackphone a target of law-enforcement officials, who say encryption technology makes it harder for cops to catch criminals). But even with a Blackphone, users should be careful about what they type or upload. As Blackphone CEO Toby Weir-Jones explains, “It’s dangerous to assume anything is a magic invisibility cloak.” Coolest Cooler / $399 Buy here For more than 60 years, coolers have done a fine job putting party refreshments on ice. But that wasn’t good enough for Ryan Grepper. “We wanted the cooler to be a place where people gather—to have all the things that make a space somewhere you’d want to hang out,” says the former medical sales rep. The result is the world’s smartest all-purpose party starter. It stores food and drinks, sure. But it also touts a blender (“for vodkaritas,” Grepper offers), an LED lid light (“to see if you’re reaching for beer or Clamato juice”), a USB charger (“so nobody’s phone dies”), a Bluetooth speaker (for tunes) and big wheels designed to navigate many terrains (beach, parking lot). “I just want to make the coolest cooler out there,” says Grepper. Hence the name: Coolest Cooler. Since Grepper’s prototype first appeared on Kickstarter earlier this year, roughly 63,000 backers have contributed $13.3 million to make it a reality. It’s now the most funded creation in the site’s history, besting hits like the Pebble smart watch and Oculus Rift’s virtual-reality glasses. Lumo Lift / $100 Buy here  You can probably guess why so many people have posture that causes back pain: “We simply forget” to stop slouching, says Monisha Perkash, whose company, Lumo BodyTech, created the ultimate reminder. Once users clip the Lumo Lift, a chiplike gadget about the size of a thumb, onto their shirt, it analyzes neck and spinal positions and vibrates when they’re less than ideal. Although the system isn’t perfect—it can buzz when you lean for necessary reasons, like taking a phone call—it has exceeded internal sales goals. Half of its users are women, which is impressive given that early adopters for gadgets often tilt male. BMW i3 / $41,350 Available at BMW dealerships nationwide For the most part, electric cars have been slow, sexless and stolid to drive—or stunningly expensive. So when BMW, the self-described maker of “the ultimate driving machine,” announced it would start selling them, it had a high bar to clear. The I3 delivers. In addition to getting 70 to 110 miles (113 to 177 km) on a single three-hour charge, its novel design allows drivers to use a single ­pedal to both accelerate and brake (press down to go, ease up to stop), which results in more energy-efficient driving. And because so-called range anxiety—the fear of running out of juice on the road—remains a top reason people don’t buy electric, BMW is pioneering ways to ease customers’ doubts. Among them: an optional backup gas motor that can recharge its batteries in a pinch and a program that lends owners a gas-powered vehicle for longer trips. Microsoft Surface Pro 3 / $729 Buy here  Microsoft’s latest “hybrid” bundles the power of a laptop into a svelte 12-in. tablet and can run desktop apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint. That, as well as a slim, detachable keyboard cover and a built-in stand that makes the Surface usable on a desk, makes it more suitable than other tablets for professionals like doctors and businesspeople. No wonder organizations such as Coca-Cola and Seattle’s Children’s Hospital have adopted it in droves. Ringly / $195+ Buy here Like many professional women, Christina Mercando keeps her smartphone in her purse, which meant she was constantly digging it out to check for important notifications. But what if she could get that info from something she was already wearing, much as pants-wearing men can feel a phone buzz in their pocket? That’s the thinking behind Ringly, a line of rings that can be programmed to glow when wearers get an email from their boss, a text from their Uber driver or any number of other can’t-miss communications. Mercando, a former product and design manager at eBay, raised more than $1 million to realize her vision. So far, the concept is working: the first 1,000 Ringly rings, which debuted in June, sold out within 24 hours. Pillpack / prices vary Available at pillpack.com “I grew up in a family that owned and operated a pharmacy,” says T.J. Parker, who knows firsthand how confusing it can be for people to track which meds to take when, especially if they fill multiple prescriptions. That’s why the e-pharmacy he runs now, PillPack, doesn’t traffic in bottles. Instead, every two weeks, patients are sent a dispenser, which has their medication—all of it—sorted into a ticker tape of tearable packets, organized by date and time. For now, service is limited to patients with multiple prescriptions. But Parker’s ultimate goal is to make the pharmacy experience simpler for everyone, even patients on short-term antibiotics. “Superbananas” Developed by the Queensland University of Technology In sub-Saharan Africa, up to 30% of kids under age 5 are at risk of going blind—among other conditions—for one simple reason: they don’t get enough eye-nurturing vitamin A. But what if the bananas that make up a lot of their diet could be re-engineered to deliver it? That’s the idea that struck Australian biogeneticist James Dale when he visited Uganda in the early 2000s. With backing from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Dale and his team began developing a vitamin-A-enriched “superbanana”; human trials start soon in the U.S. In Africa, they will be introduced using what Dale calls a “reverse Ponzi scheme” to spark adoption. Village leaders will be given 10 free superbanana plants to grow, on the condition that they give at least 20 new shoots to other villagers, who will do the same. “These bananas could potentially solve” a major health problem, Dale says. Copenhagen Wheel / $799 Preorder at superpedestrian.com (to ship spring 2015) We know that biking is good for us and good for the environment. But getting around on a bicycle can seem daunting, especially in a large city with a hilly terrain. To lessen that burden, Cambridge, Mass.–based Superpedestrian has developed the Copenhagen Wheel, a standard-size wheel—it can be attached to the back of most bicycles—that boasts a rechargeable, battery-powered motor. Depending on rider preferences, entered through a smartphone app, the motor can kick in power throughout the ride or just on hills. Sensors also track road conditions, air temperature and potholes, so cyclists can share real-time information about best routes. “Cities are reaching a limit in terms of how many more cars they can accept,” says Assaf Biderman, founder and CEO of Superpedestrian; indeed, studies like those from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute suggest that the U.S. has reached “peak car.” The Copenhagen Wheel, which has raised more than $6 million (partially through crowdfunding), may help make cycling a more viable alternative. MotionSavvy uni / $198+ Preorder at motionsavvy.com (to ship fall 2015) For the millions of deaf people who cannot speak, everyday communication often requires costly human translators and tedious note writing. Enter the Uni, a tablet and attachment that leverages motion-sensing cameras and voice recognition to translate American Sign Language into spoken words—and spoken words into text—in real time. “The need for this is so great,” writes Ryan Hait-Campbell, CEO of San Francisco–based MotionSavvy, who is deaf. Roughly 200 Indiegogo backers agree: the company has raised more than $20,000 to date. Hemopurifier Developed by Aethlon Medical What makes the Ebola virus so frightening is its speed. In a matter of days, it can pump out enough copies of itself to overtake the immune system. But the Hemopurifier, a specially designed cartridge that attaches to a dialysis machine, can tip the balance back in the body’s favor: its lectin filter attracts Ebola viruses and sucks them from the blood as it flows through. It’s been used only once, on a patient in Germany, but it did the trick—effectively curing his Ebola infection. In the future, doctors hope similar tech could be used on viruses like hepatitis. If 2013 was the year in which selfie became a buzzword, then 2014 was the year selfies became a cultural phenomenon. Look no further than a recent Pew report, which found that at least a quarter of Americans have shared a selfie on a social-networking site (including Ellen Degeneres, Kim Kardashian and President Obama). Sensing a new market, several companies have launched devices designed to streamline the selfie-taking experience. Many of them, like a hairbrush that holds your smartphone, are more goofy than game changing. But the selfie stick (produced by multiple brands), which enables users to position their smartphone beyond arms’ reach to get better photo angles, “adds genuine value,” says Van Baker, a mobile tech analyst at the research firm Gartner. “I’ve seen a lot of people using it.” Quirky + GE aros / $279 Available at quirky.com Americans spend more than $11 billion each year to blast their homes with air-conditioning, releasing 100 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air. Experts say a sizable portion of that is waste. IT consultant Garthen Leslie realized as much while driving to work last summer in Washington, past rows of empty-looking houses with humming window units that could not be turned on or off remotely. There had to be a better way. “So I sent an idea to Quirky,” he says, referring to the GE-backed site that turns people’s concepts into creations. Four months later, they had a prototype. The Aros air conditioner, which has sold nearly 50,000 units since its May 2014 release, is a provocative departure from the familiar window unit. For one thing, it’s elegant, with a sleek white exterior that’s almost Apple-esque. It’s smart too. Thanks to a companion mobile app, Aros can track owners’ movements via GPS and turn itself on and off depending on their proximity to home. It also tells people exactly how much money they’re spending to cool their residences. That’s how Quirky knows it’s working: so far, the company says, Aros owners who use the “smart away” feature that turns the unit on and off automatically have trimmed their energy use by nearly 10%. “Blue Room” Developed by Snake River Correctional Institution in Oregon For 23 hours a day, the 200 inmates in solitary confinement at Oregon’s largest prison see nothing but a tiny, white-walled cell—an experience some research suggests can heighten mental illness and make prisoners prone to suicide attempts and violence. Last year, officials began letting some of them spend their free hour in a first-of-its-kind “blue room,” an exercise space where a projector plays video of open deserts, streaming waterfalls and other outdoor scenes. That imagery, says creator Nalini Nadkarni, who studies how nature affects behavior, is designed to calm prisoners, “much in the way we walk through a park” to relax. Inmates have responded so well that guards now use blue-room time as a way to pre-empt bad behavior. Osmo / $79 Buy here  Like many kids, Pramod Sharma’s daughter loves the iPad. But “when her face is glued to the screen, six inches away, all day long—I wasn’t too happy,” he says. (Studies have shown that too much screen time can lead to attention problems and obesity.) So the ex-Google engineer and his former colleague, Jérôme Scholler, devised a way to bring virtual play back into the real world. Osmo’s “reflective AI” attachment enables the iPad camera to interpret physical objects—allowing kids to mimic an onscreen pattern with colored tiles, for example, and get rewarded for doing it correctly (while also refining their motor skills). The toy, which debuted in October, has helped Osmo raise $14.5 million in capital and is now being sold in the Apple Store. “Many kids can play at once,” says Sharma, “so it becomes more interactive and imaginative.” 94fifty smart sensor / $200 Available at 94fifty.com In sports training, as in business, there’s no more valuable asset than data. That’s why hoops pros use high-tech equipment to monitor everything from passing patterns to fatigue levels. This basketball aims to re-create those perks for casual players. It comes embedded with nine sensors and a Bluetooth chip that sends performance data to a mobile app—allowing players to measure, say, the arc of their jumpshot. If something’s off during game play, the voice of a coach (via the app) can even implore you to “go faster” or “snap your wrist.” “We get excited when we see someone improve,” says Michael Crowley, whose company, InfoMotion Sports Technologies Inc., makes the 94Fifty Smart Sensor. And apparently, that’s happening a lot: Crowley says InfoMotion has sold close to 100,000 balls. Wikipearls / $4 for a pack of two Available at select Whole Foods “Edible wrapper” sounds like an oxymoron—unless you’re WikiFoods founder David Edwards, who has devised a way to encase yogurt, cheese, ice cream and more in shells strong enough to hold their shape (in water, heat and cold) until you take your first bite. The secret lies in science: Each shell is made of particles of dried fruit or other natural substances that are tiny enough to be electrically attracted to one another; they are combined with calcium and sugar to strengthen the form. Though the frozen-yogurt Pearls—the first WikiFoods product to reach mainstream stores, thanks to deals with Stonyfield and Whole Foods—are still packaged in biodegradable bags of two, Edwards’ ultimate goal is to sell them à la carte, like apples or peanuts, in an effort to reduce the world’s packaging waste. Electric objects / $399 per frame Buy here  “There are so many artists” making beautiful works on and for computers, says digital artist Jake Levine, referencing the burgeoning Tumblr community (among others). But putting that art on physical walls has been nearly impossible. Levine’s Electric Objects, which has raised almost $3 million in funding, aims to change that. The sleek, 22-by-13-in. flatscreens are wired specifically to display art. Their brightness dims in tandem with sunlight, and their matte finish blocks glare so they resemble actual paintings. And a companion smartphone app lets users switch what is displayed on a whim—eventually, Levine hopes, from a marketplace full of digital artwork. IAmelemental / $65 for a set of 7 Buy here  Studies have shown that girls’ career ambitions can be heavily influenced by their playthings. But when moms Dawn Nadeau and Julie Kerwin started searching for female action figures that were athletic and empowering—as opposed to dolls like Barbie, most of which cannot even bend their limbs—they were dismayed to find … none. (Well, aside from “hypersexualized figures for adult male collectors,” says Nadeau.) So using funds they raised on Kickstarter—$162,906 to be exact, more than quadruple their goal—they designed and commissioned a firm to build their IAmElemental series of action figures, meant to portray women as heroes with strong personalities. Each figure embodies a different “element” of heroism, like persistence or honesty. “The idea that girls could save the world—that’s a very powerful fantasy,” says Nadeau. Corrections appended Nov. 20, 2014, to clarify the title of WikiFoods founder David Edwards and funding figures for the Copenhagen Wheel and Electric Objects.

{"type": "article", "header": "What Impressed Me the Most About Microsoft’s HoloLens", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "January 22, 2016 2:57 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4190843/microsoft-hololens-demo-2016/", "text": "I thought I was finished. I had cleared the room of every robotic creature I could see in my field of view, so where was the next wave of enemies? Something wasn’t right. And then it clicked. I heard movement coming from the left corner of the room. Sure enough, another alien foe was preparing to strike. My foe wasn’t visible until I turned to face that section of the room, which had been transformed into a battleground during my demo with Microsoft’s HoloLens headset. The bug-like creature would have gone undetected if it weren’t for that discrete auditory clue. My experience with the HoloLens, albeit brief, was enough to convince me that the future of mixed reality computing is about much more than the visuals these devices can provide. Audio is just as crucial for making a virtual environment feel realistic, whether it be a space-themed battlefield or a virtual meeting with a client. There are a lot of new sensations to absorb when trying the HoloLens for the first time, from the way it fits on your face to the experience of inspecting a life-sized hologram from every angle. Even so, the audio was the most surprising experience of them all. Going into the demo, I expected to see three-dimensional holograms that I’d be able to move and summon at will. Anyone who has watched Microsoft’s preview videos for the HoloLens would expect something similar (the field of view is smaller and more limited than what the videos suggest). But I didn’t expect the audio to be such an integral part of the experience. This was most noticeable when playing Microsoft’s Project X-Ray demo, which involved blasting alien attackers while dodging their own strikes. In this particular demo, enemies tunnel their way into the room around you. If you don’t locate these aliens quickly enough, they’ll shoot you before you’ve had the chance to evade or hit them first. A tiny orange arrow provides hints at where to look, but I found the audio clues to be just as helpful. I could, for example, hear when an enemy was far away and which corner of the room they were hiding in. It made the demo feel that much more realistic and immersive. Spatial audio isn’t new. Experts have been discussing the importance of sound in virtual and augmented reality for months. Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster, for one, acknowledged how significant sound can be to virtual experiences in an August research note. Meanwhile, the Facebook-owned Oculus Rift has long had three-dimensional audio, while Google recently added spatial audio to its Cardboard VR viewer. Surround sound has been a big part of the way we watch TV shows and movies for ages. But this type of audio has an entirely different feeling when you experience it through something like the HoloLens, and I imagine it enhances the VR experience in the same way. To be clear, the HoloLens is not the same thing as virtual reality devices like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. It’s an augmented reality headset, which means it projects 3D virtual images over the real world. Think of Microsoft’s headset as a fully functional computer to be worn on the face. Instead of looking at a screen and typing with a touchscreen or keyboard, you view 3D holograms that can be manipulated through speech, gesture, and gaze. The device is launching for developers this quarter at a price of $3,000. Virtual reality, comparatively, offers a 360-degree world that you experience inside the headset. Typically, virtual reality headsets don’t allow you to view objects in the world around you the way augmented reality gadgets do. They also usually need to be tethered to some type of computer, like a smartphone, laptop, or desktop, in order to work. It’s still early days for the HoloLens. Microsoft is in the process of courting developers; it hasn’t revealed when the headset will be available for consumers. But I’m looking forward to seeing how future apps and games for the HoloLens expand on the capabilities I’ve seen in this demo, like having virtual characters hide behind actual light fixtures in your home during gameplay.

{"type": "article", "header": "Review: Hate Your Laptop? Consider Samsung’s New Chromebook Pro", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "February 10, 2017 9:00 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4665643/samsung-chromebook-release-date-review-2017/", "text": "The good: Slim and gorgeous design, Sharp screen, Comfortable keyboard, Can run Android apps The bad: Android apps are still a little buggy and aren’t optimized for the Chromebook’s screen, Pricey compared to some other Chromebooks Who should buy: Buyers on a budget who want a simple web-surfing that also works like a tablet So you’re shopping around for a new laptop. Maybe it’s because you hate your current computer. It’s too slow, perhaps, or it’s bogged down with viruses. Whatever the reason, you increasingly find yourself using your smartphone instead. After all, you’re really just browsing the web, watching videos and making the occasional document. If that sounds like you, a Chromebook might be the perfect solution. Chromebooks are simple, usually more affordable laptops that run Google software; you can read more about them here. And Samsung’s latest Chromebook, the $549 Chromebook Pro launching in April, is a particularly compelling option — especially if you’d like a laptop that can work as a tablet, too. (Samsung is also offering a cheaper $449 Chromebook Plus model that includes a less powerful processor; it goes on sale Feb. 12.) Both of Samsung’s new models support Android apps, as will many Chromebooks moving forward, meaning most of the same apps that you use on your smartphone will work on your laptop. There’s also a stylus neatly tucked away for scribbling notes or sketching on-screen, a first for Chromebooks. And its touchscreen bends back flat against the back of the keyboard, almost resembling a digital clipboard. Where the Chromebook Pro really shines is as an everyday laptop. It’s particularly good in two key areas: Display and keyboard quality. The Chromebook Pro has a 2,400×1,600 screen, sporting an 3:2 aspect ratio that’s unusual for a laptop, but great if you’d like to watch lots of movies and TV shows. The keyboard, meanwhile, feels durable and offers deep key travel, unlike the flimsy, shallow keyboards on many less expensive Chromebooks. However, it’s missing a Caps Lock key, which you may find annoying if you OFTEN TYPE IN ALL CAPS. (You can work around this by holding the Alt and Search keys.) The Chromebook Pro’s battery gets smoothly through a day’s worth of work on a single charge. During my testing, the battery lasted for about seven hours, during which I wrote this review, played games, streamed Netflix and browsed the web. Its Core m3 processor is plenty powerful for simple tasks, and it didn’t get overwhelmed when I opened about 25 tabs in Google’s Chrome browser. However, I found its limits when trying to run Android games like Asphalt 8 and Temple Run while leaving all those tabs open. Still, it can handle games and other Android apps just find under more realistic circumstances. (Remember to close your tabs!) If you’re planning to use the Chromebook Pro mostly as a laptop, you probably won’t find much use for its stylus. But it’s a helpful accessory for sketching and handwriting in tablet mode. As with Samsung’s Note smartphones, the pen slides into a holster on the device, meaning it’s harder to lose between your couch cushions or in the depths of your bag. When you remove the stylus, an on-screen menu appears, offering shortcuts to pen-friendly tasks like taking notes. The stylus generally works well, although I noticed some problems after sketching for long periods of time. In years past, buying a Chromebook often meant making one big trade-off: Yes, they’re typically cheaper than regular laptops, but they were heavily dependent on an Internet connection to work, relying on web apps like Google Docs. That’s changed with Google’s recent move to bring the Play Store to Chromebooks. You can now download Android apps and games and then use them whenever and wherever you’d like, connection be damned. That makes Chromebooks far more useful while offline. And overall, Android apps are more user-friendly than what you’ll get with web apps. Still, some Android apps still aren’t great on Chromebooks. A few that I tested looked like stretched-out smartphone apps or desktop websites, which was less than stellar. The Pro also occasionally struggled with adjusting the screen orientation based on what I was doing. As I tilted the device back and forth to steer my car in Asphalt 8, for example, it sometimes thought I wanted to switch back to desktop mode and minimized the game. (The version of the Google Play Store on the Chromebook I tested was still in beta; Google says those purchasing the Pro will get a more polished experience in April.) With plenty of processing power, long battery life, and a gorgeous slim design, the Samsung Chromebook Pro will perform admirably as a primary laptop for casual users. More broadly, it’s another sign that Chromebooks are coming into their own, able to replace more expensive laptops without sacrificing build quality and offline functionality. But Google has more work to do if it wants Chromebooks’ Chrome OS software and Android to play nicely together. That said, if you’re thinking about getting the Chromebook Pro, it’s worth considering your priorities. Bargain hunters willing to compromise on factors like screen resolution and power can snag a cheaper device that will get the job done nearly as well, like the $279 Acer Chromebook R11. 4 out of 5 stars (Read TIME’s affiliate link policy.)

And no, it wasn’t the Apple Watch. (Though you ought to read my initial review of that device here.) The company announced a new laptop, which it calls simply MacBook, that looks more like a MacBook Air that went on a diet. How slim, you ask? It measures just 13.1 millimeters at its thickest point, and weighs in at a mere 2.03 pounds. And then you put your hands on it and realize. Gosh, it’s small. Incredibly small. Unbelievably small. I repeated a similar phrase during the keynote that introduced it, which I live-blogged for this very publication. It’s easy to think dwell on size when the device is the sole item on a sweeping black stage. It’s another thing to walk into Apple’s demo area, lay your eyes on the sold, silver, and grey varieties, and think the same thing all over again. Apple’s new MacBook is indeed all-new, and it’s a complete overhaul of the device, from components on out. It lacks fans of any sort and relies on an energy-efficient Intel Core M processor to keep it cool and prolong battery life, which Apple claims lasts an entire day. Its screen, the so-called high-resolution Retina display, measures 12 inches on the diagonal, situating the new laptop in between Apple’s two models of MacBook Air, at 11 inches and 13 inches. The difference: That Retina display packs 2304 pixels across by 1440 pixels down into that diminutive picture. Each key features a new “butterfly mechanism” that provides for a unique typing experience. It’s one that I struggled with during my hands-on time with the new MacBook. It’s not that the keys are hard to press, or even awkwardly placed. If anything, the keys are almost too easy to press. A touch-typist will fall in love with it after just a few minutes of tapping away. Others will take long to adjust to a keyboard that stretches to the very edges of the MacBook’s housing. I’m in the latter camp. A new trackpad offers the same “Force Touch” technology found in the Apple Watch. Push past the marketing and you’ll find a trackpad that doesn’t move when pressed, no matter how hard you do so. (Well, within reason—don’t shove the thing off a table.) Its immobility allows it to differentiate between amounts of pressure, and by extension, intent to accomplish different tasks. For example, moving the mouse pointer over a file icon and Force Touching on the trackpad prompts Quick Preview to open. See an address in an e-mail? Force Touch on it and a dialogue box with Apple Maps appears to reveal its exact location. Similar shortcuts are present throughout the updated Mac OS X operating system. You can adjust the degree of pressure in the System Preferences area. And try as I might on the floor of the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco, I still couldn’t believe that the new MacBook’s trackpad wasn’t actually moving. Apple assured me it’s not. The “Taptic Engine” underneath the aluminum pad leaves the user with the impression that it’s traveling in space. Color me impressed—or confused. There is a notable lack of ports on the new MacBook. In fact, there’s only one. (Well, two if you want to make the argument a headphone-jack is a port.) On its left flank is a USB Type-C port. Think of it as the more capable, younger sibling of the Lightning adapter on your iOS device. Through this single port you can charge the MacBook, transfer content, and connect it to an external monitor. It’s the Swiss Army Knife of connectors, though for now at least, external monitor functionality will require a series of adapters. Why? USB Type-C is a new standard—one that most accessory manufacturers have yet to fully commit to, let alone release products with it incorporated. So for now, adapters will be a necessity for MacBook owners. As someone who works primarily from an iPad, I can’t complain about the lack of ports. For me, adapters are a way of life and something I’ve come to accept. But that’s not for everyone, and Apple’s minimalism will be a break in how we’ve come to think about the desktop/laptop computer. I asked several attendees at the Apple event what they thought about this issue; reactions ranged from excited to discouraged. (The concerns of the latter group: what’s the point of ultraportability if I need to carry around a bunch of adapters? Fair point.) That Apple’s adapters are priced as high as $79 won’t help. But back to the new MacBook. Its Intel M Core processors clock in at a lowly 1.1GHz and 1.2GHz respectively, which is cause for concern. I wasn’t able to fully test either version outside of Apple’s demo area, unfortunately, so I can’t comment on their overall performance. I can say that during the limited time I used the new MacBook—to watch videos, browse through a Photos library, and accomplish other miscellaneous tasks—I was left with the impression that comparatively slow processors wouldn’t adversely impact performance too much. But that’s not the real point. Apple’s new MacBook is transformative based on its size alone. To put it into perspective, the new MacBook is only slightly heavier (and far thinner) than my iPad-plus-keyboard setup, but it’s a full-fledged content creation device. Which has me, and I suspect many other people, wondering: Laptop. Tablet. Now what? Jason Cipriani is Fortune’s personal technology columnist and the author of its weekly “Logged In” column.

The new Chromebook Pixel, named for its high-resolution touchscreen, boasts an Intel Core i5 processor with a boosted 8GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory (the old model had 4GB of RAM and the same storage space). The laptop also features a new charging standard called USB-C, which allows data and screen images to be transferred using the same port — Apple’s new MacBook, unveiled Monday, also uses USB-C. Google claims the new Pixel will get 12 hours of battery life. Like all Chromebooks, the Pixel uses Web-based apps to perform basic functions such as word processing, meaning its functionality is limited when you’re offline. Generally this helps keep Chromebooks cheap, typically retailing for just a few hundred dollars. But the Pixel is an exception — The basic model is on sale now for $999, while a higher-end model with increased memory retails for $1,299. Whether or not consumers will spring for a high-cost, limited-use laptop remains to be seen. Chromebook sales are rising fast, up 79% in 2014 according to research firm Gartner. But those numbers are likely driven by cheaper Chromebooks like the popular $329 Toshiba Chromebook 2, not Google’s own high-cost offerings.

That’s because he has nerve damage in both vocal cords: one was paralyzed about 14 years ago, the other left with limited movement after a cold last summer. This rare condition doesn’t slow him down, though it has made his voice raspy and faint. You have to listen carefully. But it’s generally worth it. Page, 40, is the co-founder and CEO of one of the most successful, ubiquitous and increasingly strange companies on the planet. Google is, of course, in the search business, and more important for its profitability, it is in the online-advertising business. But it’s also in the mobile-operating-system business, the Web-browser business, the free-e-mail business, the driverless-car business, the wearable-computing business, the online-map business, the renewable-energy business and the business of providing Internet access to remote areas via high-altitude balloons, among countless others. Google’s corporate strategy is one part mainstream services and one part risky long shots. Page prefers to refer to Google’s more out-there ventures as moon shots. “I’m not proposing that we spend all of our money on those kinds of speculative things,” he says during a rare interview at the Googleplex, the company’s Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. “But we should be spending a commensurate amount with what normal types of companies spend on research and development and spend it on things that are a little more long term and a little more ambitious than people normally would. More like moon shots.” This is why Google, in Page’s words, is not a normal type of company. At the moment Google is working on an especially uncertain and distant shot. It is launching Calico, a new company that will focus on health and aging in particular. The independent firm will be run by Arthur Levinson, former CEO of biotech pioneer Genentech, who will also be an investor. Levinson, who began his career as a scientist and has a Ph.D. in biochemistry, plans to remain in his current roles as the chairman of the board of directors for both Genentech and Apple, a position he took over after its co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011. In other words, the company behind YouTube and Google+ is gearing up to seriously attempt to extend the human life span. Google isn’t exactly bursting with credibility in this arena. Its personal-medical-record service, Google Health, failed to catch on. But Calico, the company says, is different. It will be making longer-term bets than most health care companies do. “In some industries,” says Page, who spoke exclusively with TIME about the new venture, “it takes 10 or 20 years to go from an idea to something being real. Health care is certainly one of those areas. We should shoot for the things that are really, really important, so 10 or 20 years from now we have those things done.” It’s worth pointing out that there is no other company in Silicon Valley that could plausibly make such an announcement. Smaller outfits don’t have the money; larger ones don’t have the bones. Apple may have set the standard for surprise unveilings, but excepting a major new product every few years, these mostly qualify as short term. Google’s modus operandi, in comparison, is gonzo airdrops into deep “Wait, really?” territory. Last week Apple announced a new iPhone; what did you do this week, Google? Oh, we founded a company that might one day defeat death itself. The unavoidable question this raises is why a company built on finding information and serving ads next to it is spending untold amounts on a project that flies in the face of the basic fact of the human condition, the existential certainty of aging and death. To which the unavoidable answer is another question: Who the hell else is going to do it? New Horizon Google’s fondness for moon shots, and its ability to take them, can be attributed in large part to Page himself. When he was a Stanford computer-science grad student, his insight that the most relevant Web pages are those with the most links to them became the basis of a remarkably precise search engine, which he created with fellow student Sergey Brin. Google became a company in 1998 and a phenomenon shortly thereafter. Page served as its chief executive until 2001, when tech veteran Eric Schmidt was brought in from software giant Novell. Even then, the unconventional troika of Page, Brin and Schmidt raised eyebrows, but the power sharing led to Google’s monster growth years. In April 2011, Page reclaimed the CEO title, and Schmidt became executive chairman. The effect of Page’s leadership at Google was immediately clear. In 2012 the company closed a massive $12.5 billion acquisition of troubled handset maker Motorola Mobility in a bid to begin manufacturing its own hardware. Page also reshaped Google’s management structure, creating the so-called L Team (L for Larry) of top managers. There were notable departures, including employee No. 20, Marissa Mayer, who left to run Yahoo. Most important, Page has shown that Google, long criticized as a one-trick pony dependent on serving ads, can grow its other businesses. Most of its $50 billion in revenue still comes from search-related ads. Analysts estimate that YouTube is a $4 billion business, and Android, its mobile operating system, is estimated to bring in an additional $6.8 billion from use on smartphones. Beyond all that is the simple fact that Page is uncommonly ambitious and impatient, and he wants the company he created to be as well. “For me, it was always unsatisfying if you look at companies that get very big and they’re just doing one thing,” says Page. “Ideally, if you have more people and more resources, you can get more things solved. We’ve kind of always had that philosophy.” Longtime Google observers tend to agree. “Guys like Larry don’t focus on preserving value; they just work on building new value,” says Ben Horowitz, co-founder of venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. “It’s the advantage of having made something from nothing.” Google has never tried to solve anything quite as far afield as, well, mortality. The idea of treating aging as a disease rather than a mere fact of life is an old one–at least as a fantasy. And as a science? The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine has been around since 1992, but the discipline it represents has yet to gain much of a foothold in mainstream medicine. Research has been slow to generate results. Consider Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge, Mass., company built around a promising drug called SRT501, a proprietary form of resveratrol, the substance found in red wine and once believed to have anti-aging properties. In 2008, GlaxoSmithKline snapped up Sirtris for $720 million. By 2010, with no marketable drug in sight and challenges to existing resveratrol research, GlaxoSmithKline shut down trials. Other anti-aging initiatives exist purely as nonprofits with no immediate plans for commercial products. Why would Google be able to get traction on aging when huge pharmaceutical companies haven’t? Page himself doesn’t oversell his knowledge of the industry. “I don’t have as much personal expertise in the technology,” he admits. “I have some knowledge of it, just being in Silicon Valley.” Google has invested in gene-sequencing company 23andMe, a startup co-founded by Anne Wojcicki, Brin’s wife. And in February, Levinson and Brin joined Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner in organizing the $33 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, to “recognize excellence in research aimed at curing intractable diseases and extending human life.” It’s a lot easier to take Google’s venture seriously if you live under the invisible dome over Silicon Valley, home to a worldview whereby, broadly speaking, there is no problem that can’t be addressed by the application of liberal amounts of technology and everything is solvable if you reduce it to data and then throw enough processing power at it. The twist is that the technophiles are right, at least up to a point. Medicine is well on its way to becoming an information science: doctors and researchers are now able to harvest and mine massive quantities of data from patients. And Google is very, very good with large data sets. While the company is holding its cards about Calico close to the vest, expect it to use its core data-handling skills to shed new light on familiar age-related maladies. Sources close to the project suggest it will start small and focus entirely on researching new technologies. When will that lead to something Google might actually sell? It’s anybody’s guess. What’s certain is that looking at medical problems through the lens of data and statistics, rather than simply attempting to bring drugs to market, can produce startlingly counterintuitive opinions. “Are people really focused on the right things?” Page muses. “One of the things I thought was amazing is that if you solve cancer, you’d add about three years to people’s average life expectancy. We think of solving cancer as this huge thing that’ll totally change the world. But when you really take a step back and look at it, yeah, there are many, many tragic cases of cancer, and it’s very, very sad, but in the aggregate, it’s not as big an advance as you might think.” Page, in other words, is a man for whom solving–not curing–cancer may not be a big enough task. Spring Cleaning Page’s tenure has not been free of controversy. Like some of its competitors in Silicon Valley, Google was caught up in a government-spying scandal earlier this year. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed a National Security Agency data-collection program called Prism, which internal documents claimed offered direct access to the servers of tech firms, including Google. The company denies this characterization. “There’s some misunderstanding, probably, of people assuming we were complicit,” Page says of the ongoing episode. “We’ve tried hard to correct those things. We work very hard to protect your data as a user.” In the wake of the revelations, Page and Schmidt have tried to walk a fine line, calling for greater transparency without explicitly criticizing law enforcement. Page has also concentrated on avoiding flops like Wikipedia knockoff Knol and Google Buzz, a Twitter clone almost nobody wanted to use. He has done this, in part, by ratcheting down the number of new-product introductions and by axing existing projects in periodic “spring cleanings.” (Both of those products, for instance, were killed.) He has, in a memorable phrase, declared his intention to put “more wood behind fewer arrows.” “When Larry co-founded Google, he was not ready to run Google,” explains venture capitalist and early investor John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. “Today, I can’t imagine anyone doing it better than Larry Page.” (Doerr sits on Google’s board.) Jeff Jarvis, author of What Would Google Do?, echoes that, noting that Page has been “ruthless” about nixing lackluster ideas. The new role model for Google products turns out to be the oldest one in the store: search. Early incarnations of Google.com slaughtered competitors like AltaVista by being vastly more accurate. Other early hits like Gmail, with its abundant free storage, and Google Maps, with its Street View imagery, succeeded for similar reasons. Google is trying to prove that it can still do that. “Larry pushes us to have 10x innovations–innovation 10 times greater than what we have in the market today,” explains Johanna Wright, a vice president whose portfolio includes one of the company’s most important growth areas, mobile search. Most of the firm’s wildest ideas are dreamed up at Google X, which functions something like Google’s fantastical subconscious. It’s a secretive research arm headquartered a three-minute ride from the main Googleplex on one of the company’s 1,000-plus brightly colored bikes. While Page tends to the entire business as CEO, Brin now devotes much of his attention to X, which he runs in partnership with scientist and entrepreneur Astro Teller. Teller’s title–just to underline the operation’s stratospheric aspirations–is “Captain of Moonshots.” (Teller changed his name from Eric to Astro, a reference to the AstroTurf-like buzz cut he sported in high school.) Except for his long hair, beard and mustache, he’s a dead ringer for his paternal grandfather, physicist Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb. According to Teller, Google X’s moon shots have three things in common: a significant problem for the world that needs solving, a potential solution and the possibility of breakthrough technology making all the difference. (Making money comes later.) Even a proposed project that meets all these criteria probably won’t make the cut. “Sergey and I being pretty excited about it is a necessary but not sufficient condition,” Teller explains. “Depending on what it is, it might require consulting experts, it might require building prototypes, sometimes even forming a temporary team to see where it goes and then saying to the team, ‘It is your goal to kill this idea as fast as possible.'” Four big Google X efforts are public knowledge. There’s Google Glass, the augmented-reality spectacles that pack a camera and a tiny Web-connected screen you can peek at out of the corner of your right eye and control with your voice and gestures. Makani Power–a startup that the company invested in and then bought outright in May–puts energy-generating wind turbines on flying wings that are tethered to the ground but circle 1,000 ft. in the air. Project Loon aims to deliver Internet access to remote areas of the planet by beaming it wirelessly from 39-ft.-tall helium balloons hovering 12 miles in the sky. Though Calico is a Google X–style long shot, it will be a separate entity from Teller’s shop. But if you had to pick a Google X moon shot with the most plausible chance of permanently reshaping the way we live, it would be the self-driving automobiles. Page first became intrigued by the concept at Stanford in the mid-1990s and seems doleful that the idea was still up for grabs when Google got around to tackling it. “I think one of the big things we did is just tell people, ‘Hey, we’re going to work on it. It’s a big deal. It should be done.’ We said we’re going to actually drive on public roads and we’ll do it safely. We’re going to test it. We’re going to prove these things are possible. That all could have been done 10 years ago.” To date, Google’s robocars, which use lasers and cameras to see other vehicles and even read road signs, have covered half a million miles of road in California, Nevada and Florida. Spotting one cruising alongside you on a Bay Area freeway–always with a human in the driver’s seat just in case–has become a common enough occurrence that it’s no longer that big a whoop. Last fall, Brin declared that the technology would be far enough along for “ordinary people” to experience it within half a decade. How Google might sell the technology was left unanswered. Google Glass, although more fully baked, is also still in a distinctly experimental phase. Brin wears them frequently, and a few thousand people outside of Google own a $1,500 beta version. A few companies, such as Evernote and Twitter, have written apps for the device. Glass won’t go on sale in a less expensive commercial version until next year, but already the way it enables users to see information and capture images is raising concerns about privacy. (Some users report that a common question from strangers is, “Are you recording me?”) Teller says the limited release of Glass is an attempt to jump-start a conversation about the technology before it’s part of everyday life. “I think if we’re aspiring to take moon shots, designing things for today’s cultural norms, on any front, doesn’t make any sense,” he says. “You’re not going to be able to help society in a really big way if you’re fully constrained by those things. But it is also not our mind-set that we’re going to decide what the new cultural norm is.” Unlike present-day NASA missions, Google’s moon shots are unlikely to suffer from underfunding: the company has a $54 billion cash stockpile, not to mention dominant market share in its most important lines of business. But will any of its long-shot projects be the Google cash cows of tomorrow? Maybe. Google X, says Teller, “is not a philanthropic organization.” But neither is it picking projects based on obvious profit potential. “If you make something a little bit better, people might pay you for it; they may not. But if you make the world a radically better place, the money is going to come find you, in a fair and elegant way.” The Core It’s not as though Google’s mainstream services–Search, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and Android–are languishing for lack of attention. “It’s funny, you’d think you’d run out of things to do in those core areas,” says Page. “But our core areas are so important to people: access to information, understanding the world, communications, interactions with other people, helping you with your work … It’s incredibly exciting to come in to work every day and work on those things.” Last year Google introduced Knowledge Graph, which lets its search engine understand and answer questions like “How tall is Justin Bieber?” Technologically, it represents an advance as significant as Page and Brin’s original algorithm. Last November, YouTube opened YouTube Space Los Angeles, a sprawling 41,000-sq.-ft. video-production facility housed in a rehabbed 1950 aircraft hangar originally erected by Howard Hughes. Smaller YouTube Spaces have opened in London and Tokyo, with more on the way. “Programmers like to move to Silicon Valley,” says Robert Kyncl, who heads YouTube’s content and business operations. “With creators, it’s New York, L.A., London, Mumbai, Tokyo. Those are their tribal areas. We felt like it was important for us to have our physical tent in those areas.” Page says his primary responsibility is to make sure that the entire organization errs on the side of thinking big. “Larry always asks hard questions,” says Brian McClendon, VP of Google Geo, who joined in 2004 when the company bought his startup and renamed its 3-D-mapping program Google Earth. “Sometimes he asks unreasonably hard questions. He forces you to think, ‘Did I actually get as much out of this plan as I could have?’ He does that even when you do great things.” Despite its founder’s emphasis on focus, Google is not immune to distractions. In August, technology site All Things D reported that Brin and Wojcicki had separated, setting off an unprecedented flurry of coverage of their personal lives. More important, even juggernauts like Apple and Amazon have learned how willing investors are to punish overly long-term bets by driving down a company’s stock price if they are displeased. So far that hasn’t been a problem: Google’s stock hit its all-time high in July at $928 a share. Page concedes that he’s been known to underestimate how tough it all can be: “I’m very optimistic and certain about things, so I always assume they’re going to get done quickly, but actually they take a long time.” He says he initially thought Google could whip up great software for next-generation smartphones in a year but learned that getting Android there was a half-decade effort. Though it did get there: Android is closing in on an 80% share of the smartphone market. Again, he sounds impatient. “Big companies–and maybe even Google too–we’re not as good as we should be at starting these things up early enough so that it’s really done by the time we need it to be a real business.” Though Page doesn’t mention Google+, the company’s attempt to roll an array of services into a cohesive Facebook competitor, it’s a case in point: In 2011 he tied part of every employee’s bonus to their contributions to Google’s social effort. The results, though slick, haven’t yet gelled into anything with a fraction of Facebook’s impact or revenue. The truth about Page’s brand of 10x thinking is that it creates a never-ending cycle. If you believe that it is always possible to be 10 times better than your current self (or the other guy), it is impossible to reach a state of self-satisfaction. Which means that even if Calico, Glass, self-driving cars, Makani Power and Project Loon all turn out to be wild, epoch-shifting hits, success for Google will still be another moon shot or two away. And Page will probably be fretting that the company isn’t moving fast enough to launch them.

All of them offer the same software features, like Whispersync, which saves and syncs the last page you read, your bookmarks and annotations across all your devices, and Goodreads, which provides reading recommendations.

Price: $289.99, buy on Amazon here Screen: Glare free 6-inch touch screen with built-in light, 300 pixels per inch, 60% more LED lights than the Kindle Voyage Weight and Thickness: 4.6 ounces, 0.13 inches (at thinnest point) Battery: Amazon claims more than nine weeks when paired with included cover The biggest difference between the Kindle Oasis and its predecessors is its sleeker and lighter design. Amazon says the Oasis is roughly 30% thinner on average and 20% lighter than any of its other e-readers. It has a sloped design, so it’s thicker where the battery and processor are stored and slims out toward the edges, vaguely resembling the binding of a book. This makes it ideal for one-handed usage. Each Kindle Oasis comes with a leather charging cover, which the company says adds around seven weeks of extra battery life to the e-reader. The Oasis also has a brighter screen than the Kindle Voyage.

Amazon eliminated the plasticky bezels to make the device’s borders flush with the screen, creating a slimmer overall look. The Voyage also comes with an adaptive light sensor and page-turn sensors unlike the Paperwhite and standard Kindle. Price: $119.99, buy on Amazon here Screen: Glare free 6-inch touch screen with built-in light, 300 pixels per inch Weight and Thickness: 7.2-7.6 ounces, 0.36 inches Battery: Amazon claims up to six weeks on a single charge Amazon updated its Paperwhite in 2015 to make its screen just as sharp as that of the Kindle Voyage. The most important differences between the Paperwhite and Voyage are physical: the Paperwhite’s screen is slightly recessed underneath its bezel, and it doesn’t come with physical page turn buttons. It’s also slightly thicker and heavier than the Voyage, although the average user probably won’t notice. Price: $79.99, buy on Amazon here Screen: Glare-free 6-inch touch screen, 167 pixels per inch Weight and Thickness: 6.7 ounces, 0.4 inches Battery: Amazon claims up to four weeks on a single charge Amazon’s cheapest Kindle skimps out on some of the flourishes you’ll get with more expensive models, but still accomplishes its basic purpose. The $79.99 Kindle comes with a lower-resolution screen that doesn’t have a reading light and a lower battery capacity. In terms of design, it’s similar to the Kindle Paperwhite, with its thick bezels and recessed screen. The Kindle also uses an older type of E Ink technology known as Pearl, whereas the newer models use E Ink Carta. The latter is said to offer a 50% increase in contrast and smoother page turns than previous generations of ePaper. (Read TIME’s affiliate link policy.)

Now, Apple CEO Tim Cook is hinting that he’s keeping an eye on one emerging technology in particular: augmented reality. “I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology,” Cook told The Washington Post. “So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain we talked about.” Augmented reality, unlike virtual reality, overlays images and graphics on the real world. This is why wild creatures that appear in Pokémon Go look like they’re hiding underneath your desk or above your computer, for instance. Google Glass also used AR to display information like alerts from incoming calls and search results above the wearer’s line of sight. Augmented reality has existed for decades, but a new class of apps and products like Pokémon Go, Microsoft’s upcoming HoloLens headset, and the Google-backed startup Magic Leap have renewed interest in the technology. This isn’t the first time Cook has expressed interest in the AR field. When analysts probed Cook about augmented reality during Apple’s earnings call in July, he said the company will “continue to invest a lot” in the technology, adding that Apple is “high on AR for the long run.” Apple reportedly has a team of experts in augmented reality and virtual reality and is said to have built prototype headsets similar to Facebook’s Oculus Rift and Microsoft HoloLens, according to The Financial Times. If Apple does intend to pursue augmented reality, Cook’s comments suggest that it will be quite some time before the tech makes its way into any of the company’s products.

It’s just that Apple, to maintain its competitive edge, refuses to tip its hand. When Apple announced its quarterly earnings last month, one analyst asked whether the company was in “a gap period” in which new products aren’t quite ready. “We have the strongest pipeline that we’ve ever had, and we’re really confident about the things in it,” Cook replied. “But as usual, we’re not going to talk about what’s ahead.” Another asked why the Cupertino, Calif. firm’s research and development spending had more than doubled in three years, growing much more quickly than revenue. Cook would only say that some of that spending would go to products in development. For some, Cook’s discreet act is starting to look old. Apple released the iPod in 2001, the iPhone six years later and the iPad three years after that. All three have defined or redefined their markets in ways that the Apple Watch or Apple TV haven’t. It’s coming up on seven years since the iPad was unveiled, and Apple doesn’t seem to have its next big hit ready for showtime. Read more: Review: Apple finally brings touch to the MacBook Pro For investors, this is leading to impatience — and worry. Apple recently posted its first annual revenue decline in 15 years. Its stock is down 6% over the past year, despite paying investors $12 billion in dividends and $29 billion in stock buybacks. By contrast, the Nasdaq Composite is up 5%. And Apple’s longtime rival Microsoft is up an even more impressive 13%. Under Steve Jobs, Apple became the corporate equivalent of Hank Aaron, a champion slugger. Five years into the Tim Cook era, Apple has managed some decent base hits, but it’s coming up short on homers. The company is far from broken, posting quarterly revenue of $46.9 billion in the most recent period. But that figure, impressive in a vacuum, marked a nearly 10% drop year-over year. And the iPhone, which makes up nearly two thirds of Apple’s revenue, saw revenue decline by 12% last fiscal year. The company synonymous with Silicon Valley innovation is now in need of a major hit. [findthebest id=”9jMXCmT3FAN” title=”Apple Inc. (AAPL) Revenue – Last 5 Quarters” width=”650″ height=”502″ url=”https://sw.graphiq.com/w/9jMXCmT3FAN&#8221; link=”http://listings.findthecompany.com/l/8500602/Apple-Inc-in-Cupertino-CA&#8221; link_text=”FindTheCompany | Graphiq”] “The cracks are showing in the Apple wall of invulnerability,” Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Andrew Uerkwitz wrote in a research note this week. He predicts the iPhone’s next release will offer “one last ‘growth’ hurrah.” And then? “Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise,” Uerkwitz said, arguing that Apple lacks the courage to lead in growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and the cloud. Other analysts have expressed similar worries, though few of them so bluntly. Still others jumped to Apple’s defense. “I think they’re making a big mistake,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said of Apple’s doubters. Technology analyst Horace Dediu, speaking at an investment conference, said that Apple has been de-emphasizing the notion it’s a hit-driven business, an expectation that has overshadowed its success in other areas. Apple’s defenders can make a strong case. Revenue from services such as music streaming and Apple’s mobile app store grew by 22% in its last fiscal year, more than doubling the growth rate of fiscal 2015. Apple’s Other Products category, which includes the Apple Watch, Apple TV and Beats audio products, grew by 11%. Products that saw revenue decline, like the iPhone and MacBooks, recently received significant upgrades that will likely boost revenue in coming quarters. There are also signs that Apple could unveil new products over the next year or so that could bring in new sources of revenue, if not replicate the iPhone’s smashing success. Apple is reportedly working on digital glasses that connect to an iPhone and display images through augmented reality. Some technology leaders, including Apple’s Cook, believe augmented reality will be bigger than virtual reality. Health care is another area of potential growth for Apple. By building on its health apps and devices like the Apple Watch and iPhone, “Apple is on the cusp of playing a larger role in the healthcare industry,” Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a research note. That would put Apple in a unique position “to better monitor their health and interact with medical professionals in a seamless way relative to current methods.” But there are also recent moves that support the Apple skeptics. The first MacBook Pro redesign in four years received lukewarm reviews, with some calling it “a step forward and a step back” and others concluding Apple was “shooting for a future it can’t quite reach.” Apple is also delaying shipments of its wireless AirPods and backing out of making products like routers and monitors. And it’s scaled back its automotive ambitions, too. Cook has told investors Apple’s innovation pipeline is as healthy as its ever been. If so, the bigger questions are when new products will arrive, and how impressive they’ll be. The spirit of skepticism embraced by many on Wall Street is lowering the bar of expectations. If and when Cook does deliver a home run, it will catch many by surprise.

Everything about it feels more refined, sharper, and faster than your old laptop. But it’s probably out of your budget, and even though everything about it is better than what you’re used to, you can’t name one particular thing you miss when it’s gone. I’ve been using Apple’s MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, for the past week. It begins shipping this month starting at $1,799 for the entry level 13-inch version. Apple also offers a 15-inch model starting at $2,399 that includes a faster processor, boosted graphics, more memory, and a larger trackpad. As the laptop’s name implies, the most significant upgrade is the addition of a thin horizontal touchscreen called the Touch Bar, which sits just above the keyboard, where the function keys once resided. The Touch Bar’s big trick is its ability to change functionality based on the software you’re using — it will show media controls in iTunes and editing buttons in Photoshop, for instance. It’s a welcome upgrade along with the new Pro’s upgraded keyboard, snappier performance and other enhancements. But it’s not as radical a change as including a full-blown touchscreen, which Apple has yet to do despite the prevalence of touchscreen laptops on the market. The new MacBook Pros’ high price make them tough to recommend unless you’re a professional who might view a new computer as an investment. There are well-built Windows laptops out there with just as much power — and full-blown touchscreens — that cost considerably less. The Touch Bar is a nice addition, but it’s not enough to warrant upgrading if your current laptop is only a couple of years old or newer. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Touch Bar The Touch Bar, the standout feature on the new MacBook Pro, is a classic Apple flourish: It’s not, strickly speaking, a must-have, but it’s pleasant to use nontheless. Put simply, it’s a tiny touchscreen whose buttons change as you hop around different apps. When browsing in Safari, for example, the center portion of the strip will display your currently open tabs, making it easy to jump between them. In Apple’s mail app, a trash can icon helps speedily delete unwated emails, while the “Move to” key helps you quickly sort messages into various folders. Most of Apple’s default apps already make good use of the Touch Bar, including Messages, Calendar, iTunes and more. Outside developers can incorporate the Touch Bar into their apps as well; you’ll find it used by Photoshop, Microsoft Office, 1Password and Pixelmator to start. I found the strip most helpful when it came to editing photos and videos, as it makes it easier to compare edited and unedited versions of photos as well as scrub through footage. Should you find yourself unhappy with the commands the Touch Bar offers by default, you can customize them to your liking. The Touch Bar also includes Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint reader, enabling faster switching between accounts as well as digital payments via Apple Pay.   While I like the Touch Bar, there are plenty of ways Apple could improve it. Not every shortcut implementation is perfect just yet — it’s nice to be able to switch tabs more quickly in Safari, for instance, but it’s tough to distinguish between different sites on the tiny screen. Nor does the Touch Bar accelerate the process of switching between apps. (Accessing the standard function keys, including the button to open Apple’s app-switching Mission Control interface, requires an extra tap when within an app.) That said, the Touch Bar is a welcome step forward in creating a computer that’s better able to adapt to users’ needs at a given time. But it’s not a necessity. Computer buyers who only need a laptop for light document editing and web surfing can steer clear of paying the extra $300 for the Touch Bar. (A non-Touch Bar version of the new MacBook Pro can be had starting at $1,499, while the company’s cheaper laptops and iPad Pros are also good options if you need an Apple machine.) Creative professionals, however, should give it serious consideration. Using It Apple’s new MacBook Pro offers other improvements, too. While it’s slightly heavier than the MacBook Air (2.96 pounds versus 3.02 pounds), its overall size remains impressively compact. The new Pro is both shorter and narrower than the Air. The refreshed MacBook Pro also features an updated version of Apple’s butterfly-style keyboard, which the company introduced with the 12-inch MacBook. Although I was reluctant to embrace that keyboard when it first appeared — it always felt too shallow to me — I enjoy typing on Apple’s latest effort. The keys feel deeper and less stiff, making it easier to type quickly when compared to previous Apple laptops. The new laptop’s trackpad is significantly larger than that of Apple’s previous efforts, which provides more room for gestures like pinch-to-zoom. Still, I found the bigger trackpad to be more of a hinderance than a benefit. I keep right-click enabled on my Mac as my secondary click mechanism, so I often found myself accidentally right-clicking when I meant to single-click. The Retina display on the new Pro is exceptionally beautiful, and will be one of the most noticible upgrades for anybody upgrading from a MacBook Air. The 2,560×1,600 display makes colors and text pop in a way that the MacBook Air’s 1440×900 screen simply can’t match. Performance, Battery Life, and Connectivity The MacBook Pro’s battery life seemed to fall in line with Apple’s claims of a 10-hour lifespan. I was able to get through a workday with a little power to spare before the laptop shut down, which is satisfactory but outpaced by the 13-inch MacBook Air. The MacBook Pro, as its name might imply, is capable of handling far more than just casual computing. Whether I was running video games on their highest graphics settings, opening and editing high resolution photos, or browsing Safari with 10 or more tabs open, I never saw any performance hiccups. Before buying the MacBook Pro, you ought to consider the port situation. The new laptop includes four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports, with nary a standard USB or SD card slot to be found. USB-C offers plenty of benefits over older ports (like faster file transfer speeds), but we’re still in the middle of a transition period, meaning you’ll probably need to buy some adapters for connecting your MacBook Pro to external displays, a camera memory card, or even, yes, an iPhone. That’s going to be a headache for many potential buyers, especially professional users who rely on lots of peripherals to get their job done. Apple has long been known to make controversial connectivity decisions. The MacBook Air was initially derided for its lack of an optical drive, while the more recent omission of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7 invited similar complaints. For its part, Apple says wireless connectivity and USB-C are the future. That’s likely true, but it’s not particularly helpful to those who’ll need to spend extra money on dongles. (Apple responded to an outcry over the MacBook Pro’s port situation by reducing the price of adapters through the end of the year.) Conclusion Windows PCs have undergone huge transformations over the past several years: they’ve gained touchscreens, the ability to bend and twist, and many can pull double duty as tablets. Apple’s MacBooks haven’t changed nearly as dramatically — using an Apple laptop built in 2015 is largely the same as using one from 2010. Apple’s new MacBook Pro changes all that, finally revealing what Apple believes is the next step for its laptops. Unlike many Windows manufacturers, Apple isn’t trying to compeletely reinvent the laptop. Rather, it’s thinking about how laptops can get smarter, with features like the Touch Bar that adapt to meet users’ needs at a given time. Early reports indicate Apple may double down on this concept with an entire keyboard of context-aware buttons, rather than just a single row. Still, the new Macbook Pro isn’t for everybody. As helpful as it may be for digging through your inbox or inserting emojis into your chats, its steep price means it’s a better buy for media professionals rather than everyday users. (And even they will have to deal with the port situation.) For the rest of us, there are plenty of cheaper options, including Apple’s lower-end laptops, its iPad lineup, and excellent-yet-affordable Windows laptops like Dell’s XPS 13. 4 out of 5 stars Pre-order now: 15-inch model starting at $2,399 here, 13-inch starting at $1,799 here Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4546888/apple-macbook-pro-2016/", "http://time.com/3745070/usb-c-macbook/", "http://time.com/4559059/apple-dongle-accessory-usb-macbook-pro-prices/"], "sentiment_score": 0.14478995310245318, "subjectivity_score": 0.4580728264790763},

We have at least three primary screens we use almost on a daily basis: a TV, a PC (laptop or tablet) and a smartphone. And lately, more screens have been showing up in our cars, appliances and wearable devices. However, even when it comes to major companies’ operating systems, too often the screens’ user interfaces and data are different on each device. For example, the Mac’s user interface is different than the user interface on Apple’s iOS devices. And Google’s Android user interface on its tablets and smartphones is different than what’s found on the company’s Chromebooks. Same goes for these companies’ TV products. Also, some of your data is stored locally, so it’s not shared with or available on any other device you own. At Apple’s recent Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, the company introduced a concept it calls “continuity.” What this basically means is that in the future, the new Mac operating system, called Yosemite, will look and feel much more like an iOS-based device. In fact, if the continuity theme plays out as I expect it will, Apple will eventually make all of its products — including Apple TV and Apple CarPlay and any wearable devices — have the same look and feel, making it very easy to go from one device to another seamlessly. Also, in this continuity idea, everything would be in sync. That means if you change something on one device, it would be changed and updated on any other Apple device you had tied to the company’s ecosystem of apps and services. Over at Re/code, my good friend Walt Mossberg did a great piece called “How the PC Is Merging With the Smartphone.” In it, he talks about Apple’s continuity approach to make the PC act, look like and work like an iPhone or iPad. He also mentions how Google is doing something similar with Chromebooks and Android. For many years, I have thought that in an ideal digital world, people would ultimately have many screens as part of their lifestyles. In that vision, I also had this idea that all of these screens would be connected, work together seamlessly and, perhaps more importantly, would always be in sync with one another. The other part of this vision is that the user interface on each of these devices would be the same. I have always felt that people would be more likely to use new devices if each device worked the same as any other device they already had. In a sense, I think Apple’s continuity strategy pretty much maps to this vision I have written about for two decades. Now, lest you think I am a serious visionary when it comes to these types of connected ecosystems, keep in mind that this vision came out of my own need for something like this. For most of my career, I really only had to deal with one computing screen — that being the one on a personal computer. However, my digital life became more complicated when I got my first feature phone. It, too, had apps on it, albeit very limited ones. But the operating system and user interface on my feature phone were completely different than the ones on my PC. I had to learn how to use it from scratch. Then, as early as 1990, I started to use tablets. Again, because of the form factors and designs, the operating systems and user interfaces on my first three or four tablets were all different. I had another set of learning curves to contend with before I could use them with any sense of ease. Also, all of the data on these devices was local and none of these devices talked to each other. What I wanted was for all of my devices to work together seamlessly, talk to each other, have the same operating system and user interface, and to always be in sync. Interestingly, we have had the technology to deliver on this vision for over five years, but only now have the big companies started to really move us in this direction. If Apple’s overall continuity strategy is fully realized, it would mean that every one of my Apple devices will look and act alike, talk to each other and always be in sync. If I get a new device that is part of Apple’s portfolio, I would have no new learning curve. For consumers, this would is a big deal. First, if you learned the user interface on one device, it would be the same on all of your devices. Second, the apps and data would all be the same or extremely similar, and available on most of the screens you would be using. The exception would be wearables. These screens bring limitations, so any interface and operating system would be highly streamlined. However, even in this case, they would work very much like the other devices and, more importantly, would be connected to these devices either directly or through the cloud. And third, all of the data on all of the devices would be in sync and, at least in theory, would work together seamlessly. Apple is not the only one driving us in this direction. Microsoft and Google are similar in that all of their respective devices will eventually look, feel and work in similar ways, tying directly into their cloud-driven ecosystems. The goal, of course, is to hook consumers into one particular ecosystem, making it hard to leave once you’re invested in the products that are tied to their respective apps and services. At the moment, it appears to me that Apple has the broader ability to deliver on this “continuity” concept since it owns the devices, processors, interfaces and services layer, making it easier to make all of its devices work together with a look and feel that’s similar across all of the company’s products. Google would like to do the same, but there is still too much fragmentation in the Android world at the moment. But over time, I suspect it will achieve a similar level of device continuity. Microsoft’s concept would be the most challenging to deliver due to its various operating systems. And with the acquisition of Nokia, Microsoft adds Android to its product line, which has a completely different ecosystem tied to it. However, all three companies are working hard to deliver on this continuity vision, and as they succeed over time, it should make it easier for customers to better fit these companies’ devices into their digital lifestyles.

{"type": "article", "header": "Everything You Need to Know About Apple’s OS X Yosemite", "author": "John Patrick Pullen", "update_date/publish_date": "October 30, 2014 10:57 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/3548338/apple-osx-yosemite-features/", "text": "On the screen and behind the scenes, Apple’s new desktop operating system, OS X Yosemite, is packed with new features large and small. From a graphical overhaul that even changes the Mac’s longstanding fonts to reconfigured apps that sling data back and forth from your computer to your iDevice, it’s a big leap for Apple. Here’s what you need to know before you download Yosemite: Who Can Use It: This rule isn’t confirmed by Apple, but if your Mac’s body is made of aluminum, it can probably run Yosemite. That includes iMacs dating to mid-2007, MacBooks from late 20008, Macbook Pros going back to mid-2007, all the Macbook Airs, Mac Minis from early 2009, and Mac Pros since 2008. Whats It Does: In a word, lots. On the surface, a redesigned interface that stretches all the way down to the toolbars serves as window dressing for great new capabilities and some under-the-hood improvements. Some of these visual enhancements, like a dark menu bar, are simple but have been in demand by users for years. Meanwhile, other graphical add-ons, like the “Today” panel in the Notification Center, which displays dynamic information pertinent to the user, are real productivity boosting time-savers. But Yosemite’s biggest and most innovative new feature is called Continuity, a technology that allows your Mac to connect with your iPhone and/or iPad to do some very useful things. For example, you can answer phone calls (streamed from your smartphone) on your computer, you can quickly connect to your Mac to your mobile device to use it as an Internet hotspot, and you can start work on one device (say, writing an email on your iPad) and pick up where you left off on another. Its a fluid technology that makes workflows actually flow. There’s also an abundance of enhancements to the Mac’s default apps. For instance, Safari has undergone a huge overhaul, with security enhancements like stronger cookie blocking and integration of the non-tracking DuckDuckGo search engine, along with improved video performance that makes Macs more energy efficient Netflix machines. Continuity integration makes it possible to receive SMS messages in iMessage and to make a phone call on your iPhone (or from the FaceTime app) simply by clicking on an icon in the computer’s Contacts app. It’s improvements like these make Yosemite a bold first step towards unifying Macs and iDevices into one seamless supercomputer. Why You Should Install It: While these latest features provide plenty of reasons to run the newest Mac operating system, the simplest Yosemite justification is that the download is new and free. But beyond having the latest and greatest capabilities for a song, it’s almost always advisable to update any software as soon as upgrades are available, because newer versions patch security holes while older versions are vulnerable to being hacked. Of course, it’s entirely possible that after upgrading her Mac, your cousin’s best friend’s daughter wasn’t able to log into her email anymore — but issues like these are generally few and far between. If you want to hear more horror stories, search the web for “OS X Yosemite problems,” just keep in mind that people typically don’t post comments online when things work great (which is most of the time). And along those lines, this operating system is better than most first builds that Apple has released previously. That’s because prior to launch, OS X Yosemite had a widely-released public beta (a user-friendly practice that Apple only began doing recently), which helped make the software stable and functional. However, there is one caveat: if your computer is one of the older compatible Macs, it might be wise to decline the install — especially if you’re planning to upgrade your hardware soon, anyway. Then you’ll be upgraded by default, because all new Macs ship with Yosemite already installed. How to Get It: For the rest of us, Yosemite is available for download on the Mac App Store, for free. Depending on the speed of your Internet connection, the 5.16 gigabyte file could take a while to copy to your computer, so make sure you have the time and storage space necessary to run the updater.

Some six months after unveiling the device, CEO Tim Cook filled in many of the blanks, such as how much various versions will cost and how long the built-in battery will last. Cook revealed more about the device’s price. The Watch, which comes in three distinct lines and various metals, is the most customizable device the company has ever sold. The entry-level Watch Sport will cost $349 and $399, depending on the size of the body, 38 millimeters or 42 millimeters. The mid-tier Watch collection will range from $549 to $1099. The top-of-the-line Watch Edition will retail for $10,000 and up. Cook said the later device will be available in limited quantities and only in certain stores. Apple will begin taking Watch pre-orders on April 10, and is planning to offer a preview program to let customers try the devices on in stores. The Apple Watch will go on sale April 24. Cook also reviewed the device’s major features, including receiving and making phone calls, reading email, making wireless payments, controlling the music on a connected iPhone, and tracking exercise. Apple’s CEO touted features that let two Apple Watch owners send each other animated messages and imprints of their heart beats. Many of those features had been presented last year. The Apple Watch will be able to run third-party apps, much like iPhones and iPads, and the firm showed off a few new examples. Kevin Lynch, the company’s vice president of technology, demonstrated a weather application powered by The Weather Channel. Another, messaging app WeChat, works on the Watch much like it does on a smartphone, allowing users to send one another text and images. Other apps included Facebook’s Instagram, ride-hailing app Uber, music app Shazam, and a ticketing system for American Airlines. Lynch said the Watch connects to a user’s iPhone over both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, meaning the phone doesn’t necessarily have to be in close range of the watch to provide data connectivity. Cook for the first time showed off the company’s Apple Watch iPhone software, which will allow users to download apps for the device and configure their wearable via their phones. He also addressed the Watch’s battery life, one of the device’s biggest unanswered questions. He said the device would last 18 hours on a single charge. Cook showed a video of former model Christy Turlington using the device. She wore the Watch during a half marathon she ran for charity in Africa. She spoke about how the device tracked her run, including distance and pace. In a departure from previous Apple presentations, Turlington then came on stage wearing the device to give a testimonial. “We want to the Apple Watch to help you prepare for your next marathon,” Cook told her.

{"type": "article", "header": "6 Crucial Unanswered Questions About HBO’s New Streaming Service", "author": "Victor Luckerson", "update_date/publish_date": "October 15, 2014 12:53 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/3510575/hbo-streaming-service-no-cable/", "text": "After years of maybe’s and not yet’s, HBO has finally announced that it will offer its content as a streaming service independent of a cable subscription sometime in 2015. People who don’t subscribe to cable have been begging HBO to take their money for years. Now, it seems, a rising tide of cord-cutters getting rid of cable and young adults who never subscribed to cable in the first place have compelled the network to fulfill their wishes. But the announcement was painfully light on details. We don’t even know whether this service will be the same as HBO Go, the robust streaming app the network currently offers to its subscribers. Here are the questions HBO still needs to answer: How much will it cost? They don’t call it “premium cable” for nothing. The cost of HBO currently differs based on pay-TV provider and region but generally falls in the range of $15 to $20. Many cable operators offer the service at a discounted price of $10 per month for the first year. High-definition streaming on Netflix, for comparison, costs $8.99 per month. It’s hard to say where exactly an independent HBO would fall on this spectrum. Time Warner, which owns HBO, currently splits subscription fees with cable operators, but the operators handle the billing, customer service, delivery of content and some marketing. With a standalone service, HBO would have to deal with those issues itself and charge a fee appropriate to recoup those costs. Two years ago, HBO tweeted that a TechCrunch story that pegged the amount people would pay for the service at $12 per month “has it right.” Will I be able to watch the newest episode of Game of Thrones? If this service is the same as the current streaming service, yes. HBO Go allows customers to live stream the network’s TV shows on their laptops, mobile devices, and televisions. But it’s worth noting that HBO didn’t specifically say that HBO Go will be the standalone offering. The company has been notoriously reticent to offer its newest content to people who don’t pay for cable. Even the monumental deal to bring HBO content to Amazon Prime Instant Video for the first time doesn’t include Game of Thrones or more recent seasons of current shows like Boardwalk Empire. Will the service perform well, technically? Going by HBO’s past track record, this could be a problem. HBO Go crashed during the season finale of True Detective and multiple times during the last season of Game of Thrones because too many people were accessing the service simultaneously. Obviously a standalone service would be even more popular. No doubt HBO would beef up its servers to handle additional load, but that added expense would place more pressure on the network to raise the price it charges customers. Will Internet service providers play nice with an HBO streaming service? This year has seen an ongoing debate between Netflix and several ISPs over who should pay to deliver Netflix’s content to customers. Netflix suffered slowed speeds on the networks of Comcast and Verizon until the company agreed to pay them to establish a better connection. As a streaming service that will also stream its content over ISP’s pipes, HBO could face similar costs. It doesn’t help that many of the ISPs are also pay-TV operators that aren’t likely to be pleased that HBO is giving customers an incentive to cut the cord. Can I finally dump my cable company? If you were only keeping it around for HBO, and the new service functions similarly to HBO Go, sure. Otherwise, you’ll still need cable to watch a lot of TV content live, especially sports. But the fact that a cable network as prestigious as HBO is willing to break out of pay-TV’s walled garden in such a big way could have implications later. Other channels that already have robust streaming apps, such as FX and ESPN, could follow in HBO’s footsteps. Does this matter to me if I still have cable? It might. Cable operators initially offer HBO at a discount to entice customers to subscribe to the service. Now that HBO is becoming a competitor as well as a partner, they may be less motivated to subsidize the channel. And with HBO having to take on new infrastructure costs, the network may pass those expenses along to both cable and non-cable subscribers.

Pokémon Go is a smartphone game that blends the real and digital worlds, tasking players with exploring their neighborhoods to find creatures and treasure for in-game use. Just days after being released in the U.S., Go is seemingly everywhere. Walking around New York this weekend felt like being in an episode of Black Mirror. People were wandering around with their heads in their phones—more than usual—and every once in a while, they would stop and exclaim, “There’s a Geodude nearby!” or some such. The hunt is on. Go‘s popularity extends well beyond this city. A rapidly increasing number of YouTube videos show players worldwide going for drives around their neighborhoods (they will brake for Pokémon). As of Monday morning, Go is the top free app in Apple’s iTunes Store. Its international rollout has been paused as its developer struggles to deal with the intense server demand. While the game was developed by Google spinoff Niantic, Nintendo investors are celebrating the company’s involvement regardless, sending its stock up over 20% as they cheer a rare success in smartphone gaming. (Nintendo is a part owner of both Niantic and Pokémon’s license owner.) What explains Pokémon Go‘s seemingly inexplicable popularity? Go offers an interesting twist over most games in that players must set off and move around their physical world. (Blog Gizmodo’s recent headline nailed it: ‘Sore Legs Become Pandemic As Pokémon Go Players Accidentally Get Exercise.’) But beyond that, Go is almost boringly simple: Once you encounter a Pokémon in the wild, Go switches into “capture mode,” where users flick Pokeballs at the creature until they nab it. It gets more interesting a few hours in when players are able to lay claims to Pokegyms, digital representations of real-life landmarks where creatures can battle one another for supremacy. The Pokémon skin is going a long way towards fueling this fire. Millennials around my age—27—feel considerable nostalgia for Pokémon, which had its heyday while we were middle schoolers. Younger kids, meanwhile, are still discovering (and loving, it seems) the franchise for the first time. It remains the third-best selling game series ever, behind Mario’s many iterations and Tetris. Had this been anything other than a Pokémon game, there’s little chance it would’ve caught fire the way it has. (Indeed, Niantic’s previous and similar game, Ingress, has a dedicated but relatively small player community of amateur cartographers.) It’s also possible that because Go forces players outside, they’re more visible than people enjoying the latest Call of Duty or Madden title. By plan or by coincidence, Go‘s release was well-timed. The summer months offer the best weather for getting out of the house and exploring on foot. School, meanwhile, is out, giving younger kids plenty of free time. The game also happened to launch at the end of a particularly brutal week in the U.S., offering a palliative diversion. (Go, it should be said, is also generating some unfortunate news stories, ranging from near-miss car accidents and alleged robberies fueled by in-game items used to lure victims.) Whether the Pokémon Go craze lasts is an open question. Smartphone games have a habit of burning brightly and then flaming out. Remember Bejeweled? Or Words With Friends? Or Dots? Still, the early indications are that Go will last through the season at least. The game already has more users than Twitter, by one count. Go-themed bar crawls are being planned. An unofficial but potentially massive meetup is in the works for the Nintendo Store in midtown Manhattan next month. Long story short, 2016 is shaping up to be the Summer of Pokémon.

Let’s put aside for a moment that Apple’s quarterly profit is down 27%, that iPhone revenue is down 23%, and that unit sales of the iPhone, iPad and Mac lineups are all down. (iPad revenue is actually up 9%, it should be noted.) For Apple, the most alarming numbers are coming from China. Apple’s revenue in China is down 33% year-over-year, the company says. (That’s actually “Greater China,” which also includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.) China had been Apple’s second-biggest market in terms of revenue, but the drop-off was enough to allow Europe to reclaim that spot for the first time since early last year. Why is Apple struggling in China? First and foremost, its expensive iPhones are facing competition from increasingly capable and cheaper handsets from local manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi. The Chinese government, meanwhile, has been making life difficult for the Cupertino tech giant, banning services like book and movie sales. (A patent battle hasn’t eased the headache.) That sales ban is particularly problematic for Apple. Facing slowing hardware sales, Apple CEO Tim Cook has increasingly been trying to convince the world to view his company as a provider of services. Indeed, Apple’s services category, which includes things like music and app sales, is once again a bright spot of Apple’s earnings report, with revenue up 19%. But if Apple can’t count on making services money in China, that narrative becomes a harder sell.

With its latest model, the company takes a big step towards achieving that goal. The new Kindle Oasis, which will start shipping on April 27 and costs $289.99, is Amazon’s most compact e-reader yet. Preorders start immediately. Amazon says the new Kindle is roughly 30% thinner and 20% lighter than its predecessors. That’s largely thanks to a new design, which features a sloped form factor with a thicker portion on one side resembling a book binding. (The thicker side makes the Oasis easier to grip, while also housing its processor and battery.) Technological advancements, like display technology that’s as thin as aluminum foil and a frame that’s been crafted using a process known as structural electroplating, also help reduce the Oasis’ width. Electroplating is a technique that enables Amazon to create a single sheet of metal that’s denser in certain areas than others, giving the device more protection in spots that may be prone to damage while maintain a thin overall profile. The Oasis includes 60% more LED lights than its Kindle Voyage, making it the brightest Kindle display ever. The Oasis comes with a cover that gives the e-reader an extra seven weeks of battery life, according to Amazon. This leather case is included with the Kindle and comes in black, merlot, and walnut color options. After having used the Kindle Oasis briefly, I can say that it certainly felt portable and lightweight. Text looked crisp and sharp, and there was no lag when flipping through pages or switching the device between hands. (The Oasis’ accelerometer can tell if you’re holding it in your left or right hand, adjusting the orientation accordingly.) However, the coating on the back of the e-reader gathered fingerprint smudges quickly. This won’t be a problem for those who frequently keep their Kindle in a case. The Kindle Oasis is a gorgeous, compact e-reader, and an engineering marvel for Amazon. But it’s an expensive device — it’s nearly $100 above the Kindle Voyage, which offers a similar experience in a form factor that’s only slightly larger.

{"type": "article", "header": "You Asked: What Is a Chromebook?", "author": "John Patrick Pullen", "update_date/publish_date": "August 31, 2016 11:16 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4474181/what-is-a-chromebook/", "text": "A little over five years ago, Sundar Pichai, then Google’s vice president of Chrome, took the stage at the company’s 2011 developer conference and revealed a surprising new product from the search giant. It wasn’t a new advertising program, search algorithm, or app. Instead, it was an entirely new personal computing operating system, Chrome OS.  How important has this product been for Google? Well, Pichai is now the company’s CEO. Chrome, the web browser that’s the backbone of the operating system, is the most widely used in the world. And this year, Chrome OS machines outsold Macs for the first time. So in other words, Chrome has caught on big time. When Google set out to build a system optimized for how people were using their computers in 2011 — and how they’d use them today — they began by looking at the operating systems on the market. “Most of these systems were designed 25-plus years ago,” says Kan Liu, Google’s senior director of product management with Chrome. “If you think of what you do on a PC today, I would argue that 95% of the time that you spend is in a browser.”  So, Google built Chrome around the browser. That eliminated a lot of what Liu calls “crust that had built up over time” on legacy computers like Windows and Mac machines. “They were designed for use cases (like floppy disk drives) that don’t exist anymore, and enable more holes for viruses to attack,” he says.  The result was Chromebooks, laptops that run Google’s Chrome OS. They come in many different shapes, sizes, and price points, but they all share a few common characteristics. Most noticeably, they start up fast, have built-in virus protection, automatically update their software, and are generally inexpensive. For these reasons, Chromebooks have becoming increasingly popular with casual Internet users — people who just want to surf the Web — and in the education field, a market that Apple had once dominated. It’s interesting that Chromebooks are taking on Macs, because when the system was revealed, experts had Google gunning for Microsoft and the popular, inexpensive ultrabooks and netbooks of that day. But with Windows 10 shifting Microsoft’s strategy towards hybrid tablet-turned-computers, an opportunity opened up for Google in low-cost laptops. And manufacturers followed. That’s why — just as you can find many variants of Android phones and tablets — you will also see Chromebooks from many different makers. Currently, manufacturers such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, LG, Samsung, and Toshiba all make Chromebooks. Haier and Hisense currently make the least expensive models on the market, while HP puts out one of the best models at just under $400. Every Chromebook is a little different, helping to meet the needs of a variety of users. Some, like the Acer Chromebook R11, have plenty of ports, while others, like the Dell Chromebook 13, have excellent (13 hours) battery life. But one thing that unites the platform is how people use it. First, in an increasingly cloud-based computing world, it makes ever-more sense to use an operating system built around a web browser like Chrome. Of course Google has built its own suite of productivity apps like Docs, Sheets, and Gmail, but if you can’t ween yourself off Microsoft’s programs, Word, Excel, and Outlook offer browser-based solutions too. There’s also a Chrome Web Store for adding apps that were custom-built for the platform. But even more game-changing is Chrome OS’s ability to port your computer to any Chromebook you might use. Simply type in your Google username and password into a machine, and all your apps, documents, bookmarks, and other work appears on the screen, exactly where you left off on another Chromebook. Chrome’s capabilities are catching on even outside education. For instance, some companies are integrating these low-cost machines into their workflow. “Every Starbucks you walk into has a Chromebook in it for their employees to use in their daily activities, whether it’s checking their mail or logging [human resources] data, or whatever” says Lui. However, if there is one knock on Chrome machines, it’s how little onboard storage they tend to have. Because the machines are so reliant on the web, they’re able to cut costs by skipping on big hard drives. Google gets around this by offering 100 gigabytes of storage free (for the first two years, at least). But even these largely Internet-based he machines aren’t lifeless without a connection — apps including Gmail and Google Docs will run offline, syncing up once you’re online again. And that probably won’t take long, considering how connected we are these days, anyway.

Put one of their headsets on, and you’re transported to another world. But Microsoft is taking a different tack: Wear its HoloLens headset, and suddenly holographic images appear on the walls and floor of the physical space around you. Instead of virtual reality, or VR, Microsoft calls this “mixed reality.” I’ve tried all the major VR headsets out there, but I’ve been itching to get my hands on the HoloLens since Microsoft unveiled it in January. I finally had my chance this week. In an effort to woo coders to the new platform, Microsoft is opening a HoloLens developer’s showcase at its new flagship store in New York City. The company invited me along with other journalists to come check it out on Wednesday. First, I had the distance between my pupils measured with a special tool, a calibration step that Microsoft says will happen automatically in the HoloLenses of the future. Microsoft representatives then walked me through three different demos: A shooter-style video game, a product showcase simulation, and a creative tool. The video game involved shooting bug-looking robotic aliens as they crawled out of the walls around me, Alien-style. The aliens shot fireballs and lasers, and you had to duck and dodge around them. It was visually impressive, but a little bit boring compared to more fully realized console shooters. Gaming-wise, the HoloLens is probably better suited to slower-paced games like Minecraft. The product showcase demo helped show off how companies might use HoloLens to put together a presentation or demonstrate a conceptual project. (In this case, a Swiss-style watch, which I could blow up into individual parts to examine them more closely.) The best of the three demos, though, was the creative software. Imagine Microsoft Paint, except in three dimensions. You can rotate your designs, walking around, under and above them to make sure you get all the details right. First I got to play around with an underwater SCUBA scene, copying and pasting fish at will. Then I played around with a Star Wars X-wing, changing the color scheme from red to blue. There was an option to 3D-print my design, but sadly there were no such devices in sight. All told, I walked away from the experience excited to see what creative applications HoloLens developers might come up with—it’s rarely a tool’s creators that find the most interesting uses of that tool. But there was one big drawback. Microsoft’s HoloLens videos give the impression that wearing the headset means holograms will appear all around you at once. But the actual field of vision in which those holograms appear is fairly limited. Microsoft says this helps keep wearers aware of their physical environment, but it was jarring after seeing all those videos the company has made. At this point, Microsoft hasn’t said when the HoloLens will be available commercially. But programmers interested in coding for the device, which runs Windows 10, can now apply to spend $3,000 on a developer’s edition, which begins shipping in the first quarter of 2016.

The news is momentous—and also a little confusing. The question now is, why? That Google is no longer just a search company has been evident for a long while. Though its mission has always famously been to organize all the world’s information, the company has increasingly gotten into more and more disparate lines of business—when new ventures were businesses at all, that is. Beyond selling ads against searches—it’s core moneymaking venture—Google is making driverless cars, beaming Internet signals from giant balloons, delivering high-speed Internet access, redefining television, making phones, and even trying to cure (or significantly delay) death. When such ventures might actually turn a profit, however, has been a consistent, nagging question. At best, some will never turn into big money makers and others will take decades to do so—at a significant drain of financial resources. Over the past decade, technology investors have gotten significantly more comfortable bullying big companies, no matter how profitable, which they deem lacking focus. Once untouchable firms like Apple and Microsoft have, for instance, been egged into giving up board seats or instituting investor-enriching stock buyback programs as a result. Google’s move will, presumably, insulate Alphabet from such meddling. What’s more, search and the ads sold against it, have come under increasing pressure. The business is still a behemoth: Google brought in $16.2 billion in ad revenue for quarter ended June 30 2015, up 11% year-over-year. But the shift to mobile has caused some observers to wonder about the company’s future rate of prosperity. As Internet users abandon desktop computers and flock to mobile devices, search results become harder to monetize, either because there’s less screen real estate or because users are searching in distinct apps rather than on the open web. Google’s dominant position with its Android mobile operating system is a hedge against such concerns, though not a panacea exactly. Read more Read TIME’s 2013 cover story, ‘Google vs. Death’ The birth of Alphabet is likely to be analyzed for years to come as a corporate tactic, as a management maneuver, as pure theater. At first blush the “why” is fairly straightforward: Pichai’s Google will be freed up to focus on finding ways to better monetize the mobile explosion; Alphabet will be liberated to think different (and bigger, way bigger). In the near-term, Google itself will probably look a lot like YouTube has over the past several years: a mostly independent company with its own CEO operating inside a much larger organization. The more interesting and as of yet unanswered question is “what is Alphabet?” That question may take years to answer.

{"type": "article", "header": "Google vs. Death", "author": "Harry McCracken", "update_date/publish_date": "September 30, 2013 11:47 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/574/google-vs-death/", "text": "In person, it can be a little hard to hear Larry Page. That’s because he has nerve damage in both vocal cords: one was paralyzed about 14 years ago, the other left with limited movement after a cold last summer. This rare condition doesn’t slow him down, though it has made his voice raspy and faint. You have to listen carefully. But it’s generally worth it. Page, 40, is the co-founder and CEO of one of the most successful, ubiquitous and increasingly strange companies on the planet. Google is, of course, in the search business, and more important for its profitability, it is in the online-advertising business. But it’s also in the mobile-operating-system business, the Web-browser business, the free-e-mail business, the driverless-car business, the wearable-computing business, the online-map business, the renewable-energy business and the business of providing Internet access to remote areas via high-altitude balloons, among countless others. Google’s corporate strategy is one part mainstream services and one part risky long shots. Page prefers to refer to Google’s more out-there ventures as moon shots. “I’m not proposing that we spend all of our money on those kinds of speculative things,” he says during a rare interview at the Googleplex, the company’s Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. “But we should be spending a commensurate amount with what normal types of companies spend on research and development and spend it on things that are a little more long term and a little more ambitious than people normally would. More like moon shots.” This is why Google, in Page’s words, is not a normal type of company. At the moment Google is working on an especially uncertain and distant shot. It is launching Calico, a new company that will focus on health and aging in particular. The independent firm will be run by Arthur Levinson, former CEO of biotech pioneer Genentech, who will also be an investor. Levinson, who began his career as a scientist and has a Ph.D. in biochemistry, plans to remain in his current roles as the chairman of the board of directors for both Genentech and Apple, a position he took over after its co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011. In other words, the company behind YouTube and Google+ is gearing up to seriously attempt to extend the human life span. Google isn’t exactly bursting with credibility in this arena. Its personal-medical-record service, Google Health, failed to catch on. But Calico, the company says, is different. It will be making longer-term bets than most health care companies do. “In some industries,” says Page, who spoke exclusively with TIME about the new venture, “it takes 10 or 20 years to go from an idea to something being real. Health care is certainly one of those areas. We should shoot for the things that are really, really important, so 10 or 20 years from now we have those things done.” It’s worth pointing out that there is no other company in Silicon Valley that could plausibly make such an announcement. Smaller outfits don’t have the money; larger ones don’t have the bones. Apple may have set the standard for surprise unveilings, but excepting a major new product every few years, these mostly qualify as short term. Google’s modus operandi, in comparison, is gonzo airdrops into deep “Wait, really?” territory. Last week Apple announced a new iPhone; what did you do this week, Google? Oh, we founded a company that might one day defeat death itself. The unavoidable question this raises is why a company built on finding information and serving ads next to it is spending untold amounts on a project that flies in the face of the basic fact of the human condition, the existential certainty of aging and death. To which the unavoidable answer is another question: Who the hell else is going to do it? New Horizon Google’s fondness for moon shots, and its ability to take them, can be attributed in large part to Page himself. When he was a Stanford computer-science grad student, his insight that the most relevant Web pages are those with the most links to them became the basis of a remarkably precise search engine, which he created with fellow student Sergey Brin. Google became a company in 1998 and a phenomenon shortly thereafter. Page served as its chief executive until 2001, when tech veteran Eric Schmidt was brought in from software giant Novell. Even then, the unconventional troika of Page, Brin and Schmidt raised eyebrows, but the power sharing led to Google’s monster growth years. In April 2011, Page reclaimed the CEO title, and Schmidt became executive chairman. The effect of Page’s leadership at Google was immediately clear. In 2012 the company closed a massive $12.5 billion acquisition of troubled handset maker Motorola Mobility in a bid to begin manufacturing its own hardware. Page also reshaped Google’s management structure, creating the so-called L Team (L for Larry) of top managers. There were notable departures, including employee No. 20, Marissa Mayer, who left to run Yahoo. Most important, Page has shown that Google, long criticized as a one-trick pony dependent on serving ads, can grow its other businesses. Most of its $50 billion in revenue still comes from search-related ads. Analysts estimate that YouTube is a $4 billion business, and Android, its mobile operating system, is estimated to bring in an additional $6.8 billion from use on smartphones. Beyond all that is the simple fact that Page is uncommonly ambitious and impatient, and he wants the company he created to be as well. “For me, it was always unsatisfying if you look at companies that get very big and they’re just doing one thing,” says Page. “Ideally, if you have more people and more resources, you can get more things solved. We’ve kind of always had that philosophy.” Longtime Google observers tend to agree. “Guys like Larry don’t focus on preserving value; they just work on building new value,” says Ben Horowitz, co-founder of venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. “It’s the advantage of having made something from nothing.” Google has never tried to solve anything quite as far afield as, well, mortality. The idea of treating aging as a disease rather than a mere fact of life is an old one–at least as a fantasy. And as a science? The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine has been around since 1992, but the discipline it represents has yet to gain much of a foothold in mainstream medicine. Research has been slow to generate results. Consider Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge, Mass., company built around a promising drug called SRT501, a proprietary form of resveratrol, the substance found in red wine and once believed to have anti-aging properties. In 2008, GlaxoSmithKline snapped up Sirtris for $720 million. By 2010, with no marketable drug in sight and challenges to existing resveratrol research, GlaxoSmithKline shut down trials. Other anti-aging initiatives exist purely as nonprofits with no immediate plans for commercial products. Why would Google be able to get traction on aging when huge pharmaceutical companies haven’t? Page himself doesn’t oversell his knowledge of the industry. “I don’t have as much personal expertise in the technology,” he admits. “I have some knowledge of it, just being in Silicon Valley.” Google has invested in gene-sequencing company 23andMe, a startup co-founded by Anne Wojcicki, Brin’s wife. And in February, Levinson and Brin joined Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner in organizing the $33 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, to “recognize excellence in research aimed at curing intractable diseases and extending human life.” It’s a lot easier to take Google’s venture seriously if you live under the invisible dome over Silicon Valley, home to a worldview whereby, broadly speaking, there is no problem that can’t be addressed by the application of liberal amounts of technology and everything is solvable if you reduce it to data and then throw enough processing power at it. The twist is that the technophiles are right, at least up to a point. Medicine is well on its way to becoming an information science: doctors and researchers are now able to harvest and mine massive quantities of data from patients. And Google is very, very good with large data sets. While the company is holding its cards about Calico close to the vest, expect it to use its core data-handling skills to shed new light on familiar age-related maladies. Sources close to the project suggest it will start small and focus entirely on researching new technologies. When will that lead to something Google might actually sell? It’s anybody’s guess. What’s certain is that looking at medical problems through the lens of data and statistics, rather than simply attempting to bring drugs to market, can produce startlingly counterintuitive opinions. “Are people really focused on the right things?” Page muses. “One of the things I thought was amazing is that if you solve cancer, you’d add about three years to people’s average life expectancy. We think of solving cancer as this huge thing that’ll totally change the world. But when you really take a step back and look at it, yeah, there are many, many tragic cases of cancer, and it’s very, very sad, but in the aggregate, it’s not as big an advance as you might think.” Page, in other words, is a man for whom solving–not curing–cancer may not be a big enough task. Spring Cleaning Page’s tenure has not been free of controversy. Like some of its competitors in Silicon Valley, Google was caught up in a government-spying scandal earlier this year. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed a National Security Agency data-collection program called Prism, which internal documents claimed offered direct access to the servers of tech firms, including Google. The company denies this characterization. “There’s some misunderstanding, probably, of people assuming we were complicit,” Page says of the ongoing episode. “We’ve tried hard to correct those things. We work very hard to protect your data as a user.” In the wake of the revelations, Page and Schmidt have tried to walk a fine line, calling for greater transparency without explicitly criticizing law enforcement. Page has also concentrated on avoiding flops like Wikipedia knockoff Knol and Google Buzz, a Twitter clone almost nobody wanted to use. He has done this, in part, by ratcheting down the number of new-product introductions and by axing existing projects in periodic “spring cleanings.” (Both of those products, for instance, were killed.) He has, in a memorable phrase, declared his intention to put “more wood behind fewer arrows.” “When Larry co-founded Google, he was not ready to run Google,” explains venture capitalist and early investor John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. “Today, I can’t imagine anyone doing it better than Larry Page.” (Doerr sits on Google’s board.) Jeff Jarvis, author of What Would Google Do?, echoes that, noting that Page has been “ruthless” about nixing lackluster ideas. The new role model for Google products turns out to be the oldest one in the store: search. Early incarnations of Google.com slaughtered competitors like AltaVista by being vastly more accurate. Other early hits like Gmail, with its abundant free storage, and Google Maps, with its Street View imagery, succeeded for similar reasons. Google is trying to prove that it can still do that. “Larry pushes us to have 10x innovations–innovation 10 times greater than what we have in the market today,” explains Johanna Wright, a vice president whose portfolio includes one of the company’s most important growth areas, mobile search. Most of the firm’s wildest ideas are dreamed up at Google X, which functions something like Google’s fantastical subconscious. It’s a secretive research arm headquartered a three-minute ride from the main Googleplex on one of the company’s 1,000-plus brightly colored bikes. While Page tends to the entire business as CEO, Brin now devotes much of his attention to X, which he runs in partnership with scientist and entrepreneur Astro Teller. Teller’s title–just to underline the operation’s stratospheric aspirations–is “Captain of Moonshots.” (Teller changed his name from Eric to Astro, a reference to the AstroTurf-like buzz cut he sported in high school.) Except for his long hair, beard and mustache, he’s a dead ringer for his paternal grandfather, physicist Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb. According to Teller, Google X’s moon shots have three things in common: a significant problem for the world that needs solving, a potential solution and the possibility of breakthrough technology making all the difference. (Making money comes later.) Even a proposed project that meets all these criteria probably won’t make the cut. “Sergey and I being pretty excited about it is a necessary but not sufficient condition,” Teller explains. “Depending on what it is, it might require consulting experts, it might require building prototypes, sometimes even forming a temporary team to see where it goes and then saying to the team, ‘It is your goal to kill this idea as fast as possible.'” Four big Google X efforts are public knowledge. There’s Google Glass, the augmented-reality spectacles that pack a camera and a tiny Web-connected screen you can peek at out of the corner of your right eye and control with your voice and gestures. Makani Power–a startup that the company invested in and then bought outright in May–puts energy-generating wind turbines on flying wings that are tethered to the ground but circle 1,000 ft. in the air. Project Loon aims to deliver Internet access to remote areas of the planet by beaming it wirelessly from 39-ft.-tall helium balloons hovering 12 miles in the sky. Though Calico is a Google X–style long shot, it will be a separate entity from Teller’s shop. But if you had to pick a Google X moon shot with the most plausible chance of permanently reshaping the way we live, it would be the self-driving automobiles. Page first became intrigued by the concept at Stanford in the mid-1990s and seems doleful that the idea was still up for grabs when Google got around to tackling it. “I think one of the big things we did is just tell people, ‘Hey, we’re going to work on it. It’s a big deal. It should be done.’ We said we’re going to actually drive on public roads and we’ll do it safely. We’re going to test it. We’re going to prove these things are possible. That all could have been done 10 years ago.” To date, Google’s robocars, which use lasers and cameras to see other vehicles and even read road signs, have covered half a million miles of road in California, Nevada and Florida. Spotting one cruising alongside you on a Bay Area freeway–always with a human in the driver’s seat just in case–has become a common enough occurrence that it’s no longer that big a whoop. Last fall, Brin declared that the technology would be far enough along for “ordinary people” to experience it within half a decade. How Google might sell the technology was left unanswered. Google Glass, although more fully baked, is also still in a distinctly experimental phase. Brin wears them frequently, and a few thousand people outside of Google own a $1,500 beta version. A few companies, such as Evernote and Twitter, have written apps for the device. Glass won’t go on sale in a less expensive commercial version until next year, but already the way it enables users to see information and capture images is raising concerns about privacy. (Some users report that a common question from strangers is, “Are you recording me?”) Teller says the limited release of Glass is an attempt to jump-start a conversation about the technology before it’s part of everyday life. “I think if we’re aspiring to take moon shots, designing things for today’s cultural norms, on any front, doesn’t make any sense,” he says. “You’re not going to be able to help society in a really big way if you’re fully constrained by those things. But it is also not our mind-set that we’re going to decide what the new cultural norm is.” Unlike present-day NASA missions, Google’s moon shots are unlikely to suffer from underfunding: the company has a $54 billion cash stockpile, not to mention dominant market share in its most important lines of business. But will any of its long-shot projects be the Google cash cows of tomorrow? Maybe. Google X, says Teller, “is not a philanthropic organization.” But neither is it picking projects based on obvious profit potential. “If you make something a little bit better, people might pay you for it; they may not. But if you make the world a radically better place, the money is going to come find you, in a fair and elegant way.” The Core It’s not as though Google’s mainstream services–Search, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and Android–are languishing for lack of attention. “It’s funny, you’d think you’d run out of things to do in those core areas,” says Page. “But our core areas are so important to people: access to information, understanding the world, communications, interactions with other people, helping you with your work … It’s incredibly exciting to come in to work every day and work on those things.” Last year Google introduced Knowledge Graph, which lets its search engine understand and answer questions like “How tall is Justin Bieber?” Technologically, it represents an advance as significant as Page and Brin’s original algorithm. Last November, YouTube opened YouTube Space Los Angeles, a sprawling 41,000-sq.-ft. video-production facility housed in a rehabbed 1950 aircraft hangar originally erected by Howard Hughes. Smaller YouTube Spaces have opened in London and Tokyo, with more on the way. “Programmers like to move to Silicon Valley,” says Robert Kyncl, who heads YouTube’s content and business operations. “With creators, it’s New York, L.A., London, Mumbai, Tokyo. Those are their tribal areas. We felt like it was important for us to have our physical tent in those areas.” Page says his primary responsibility is to make sure that the entire organization errs on the side of thinking big. “Larry always asks hard questions,” says Brian McClendon, VP of Google Geo, who joined in 2004 when the company bought his startup and renamed its 3-D-mapping program Google Earth. “Sometimes he asks unreasonably hard questions. He forces you to think, ‘Did I actually get as much out of this plan as I could have?’ He does that even when you do great things.” Despite its founder’s emphasis on focus, Google is not immune to distractions. In August, technology site All Things D reported that Brin and Wojcicki had separated, setting off an unprecedented flurry of coverage of their personal lives. More important, even juggernauts like Apple and Amazon have learned how willing investors are to punish overly long-term bets by driving down a company’s stock price if they are displeased. So far that hasn’t been a problem: Google’s stock hit its all-time high in July at $928 a share. Page concedes that he’s been known to underestimate how tough it all can be: “I’m very optimistic and certain about things, so I always assume they’re going to get done quickly, but actually they take a long time.” He says he initially thought Google could whip up great software for next-generation smartphones in a year but learned that getting Android there was a half-decade effort. Though it did get there: Android is closing in on an 80% share of the smartphone market. Again, he sounds impatient. “Big companies–and maybe even Google too–we’re not as good as we should be at starting these things up early enough so that it’s really done by the time we need it to be a real business.” Though Page doesn’t mention Google+, the company’s attempt to roll an array of services into a cohesive Facebook competitor, it’s a case in point: In 2011 he tied part of every employee’s bonus to their contributions to Google’s social effort. The results, though slick, haven’t yet gelled into anything with a fraction of Facebook’s impact or revenue. The truth about Page’s brand of 10x thinking is that it creates a never-ending cycle. If you believe that it is always possible to be 10 times better than your current self (or the other guy), it is impossible to reach a state of self-satisfaction. Which means that even if Calico, Glass, self-driving cars, Makani Power and Project Loon all turn out to be wild, epoch-shifting hits, success for Google will still be another moon shot or two away. And Page will probably be fretting that the company isn’t moving fast enough to launch them.

It’s an elegant piece of industrial design, which will come as a shock to absolutely no one. It’s a powerful computer with chips that eclipse most conventional laptops in speed. And it’s host to a range of new Apple accessories, some expected and some surprising. But after using it consistently for work and play, I’m convinced it’s one thing in particular: The iPad Pro is the best computer Apple has ever made. Not the fastest. Not the most portable. And certainly not right for everyone. But, considered as a whole, this version of the iPad achieves the best balance between traditional computing and the places mobile devices like smartphones and tablets seem to be inevitably taking us in the future. It’s a remarkable piece of technology anybody considering buying either a tablet or laptop computer should consider seriously.  The iPad Pro comes in several version starting at $799 for a model with 32GB of internal storage and Wifi connectivity, rising to $1,079 for a model with 128GB as well as Wifi and Cellular connectivity. That’s expensive and, once you factor in the cost of accessories, you can get just above the price of an entry-level MacBook. This iPad is big, almost ludicrously so at first encounter. The device is built around a 12.9-inch, high-resolution touchscreen that provides a viewing area the size of two “normal” size iPads side by side. It’s thin (0.27-inches) and weighs a little over a pound and a half. You get used to it pretty quickly: after a day or two, my iPad Air 2 started to look too small in contrast. But the dimensions can make it awkward to hold with one hand, especially in portrait orientation. With an iPad Air, portrait feels like the natural way to hold the device, while the iPad Pro felt most comfortable to me in landscape. Size matters, in this case, for what it allows you to do. First and foremost, the additional screen real estate—it’s 2732-by-2048 pixels—lets the device take advantage of productivity improvements Apple built into iOS 9, the company’s mobile operating system. Features called Slide Over and Split View allow you to run multiple applications at once, dividing the screen according to your needs. I found this worked particularly well when writing or editing a document in a main window while keeping track of conversations in Slack or Messages to the side. There are other advantages. Movies streamed from iTunes and HBO Now, for example, as well as the variety of games I tried looked fantastic on the bigger display. The higher resolution means webpages frequently render in their entirety. Apps like iMovie, Apple’s film editing software, shine in particular because they become much more useful. The preview window in iMovie, for instance, only takes up a small portion of the screen but is still displaying in 1080p. A lot of this is made possible by the iPad Pro’s internal components. Apple says the A9X processor inside the device is “desktop class,” a.k.a. as or more powerful than many traditional computers, but also power efficient, providing 10 hours of battery life. Benchmarks have shown the A9X is indeed both, and day-to-day use confirmed as much for me. Battery life was excellent as well, just shy of Apple’s estimates when used for web browsing and watching video. This iPad brings with it two new Apple accessories. The Smart Keyboard is a $169 magnetic cover that integrates a full set of keys inside a folding cover. In my experience it worked well, and I was especially thankful not to have to recharge it. Apple powers it through a new port built into the side of the iPad. I’ve never been bothered by keyboards that don’t have a lot of travel (i.e. keys that don’t press down very far) so I found it comfortable to use. Your mileage may vary. More interesting is the Apple Pencil. This device—don’t call it a stylus—works in tandem with the display technology in the iPad Pro to allow you to write or draw on the screen without much latency. This works and became surprisingly natural, surprisingly quickly. I used it mostly to take notes and to doodle. But when I let some of TIME’s graphic designers play with the device, they were impressed. Apple is pitching this new iPad as a potential game-changer for creatives and, the small sample size notwithstanding, the creatives I work with seem to concur. The iPad Pro is not perfect. Many apps have yet to be optimized for the larger display and, as a consequence, either look ugly or bizarrely spartan. Some games inexplicably wouldn’t run for me. These are likely temporary conditions that will be addressed as developers update their apps. More distressing are a series of small but annoying inefficiencies in iOS 9 that are a drag on the overall experience. Scrolling through webpages on a desktop Mac, to take just one example, is well calibrated—pages move to give you a small overlap in what you were reading. iOS 9, by contrast, doesn’t handle this very well. Sometimes the on-screen keyboard—which is full-size on the iPad Pro—came up despite having the external keyboard plugged in and then later disappeared inexplicably. Some ways of selecting text are counter-intuitive when you have Split View enabled. None of these are major flaws, but I hope Apple addresses them in future software updates. Apple’s tablets are a pleasure to use for two reasons: the software frequently obscures the unnecessary and touch provides an immediacy normal laptops—even so-called convertibles—don’t have. I found this to be the case with the new iPad. But I also found I could do a lot more with it than versions past, namely work on it. I found I prefer the proximity and intimacy of a touchscreen paired with a keyboard, than a regular MacBook. (Because there is no trackpad, the iPad Pro ends up sitting three or four inches closer to you.) And, for my needs at least, I concluded that the iPad Pro is powerful and versatile enough to replace my laptop.

The successor to the iPhone 7, which may be called the iPhone 7s or iPhone 8, could be a more noticeable departure from the current iPhone’s design. This year’s release will also mark 10 years since the original iPhone launched in 2007. Here’s a look at what’s been reported about Apple’s next iPhone so far. Apple may use an OLED (organic light emitting diode) screen for its next iPhone instead of an LCD display, according to reports from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. These types of screens offer better contrast than LCD displays, and are often brighter. The blacks in OLED screens are also deeper than those of LCD displays, making colors pop more prominently. Apple already uses OLED display technology for the Apple Watch, while other tech giants, like Samsung, have been using variants of OLED screens in their smartphones for years. It’s unclear whether or not all new iPhone models will feature an OLED screen or if Apple will reserve them for its high-end variant, as a report from Nikkei Asian Review indicates. One new iPhone model may feature a curved screen similar to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, according to reports from The Wall Street Journal and Nikkei Asian Review. This rounded model will likely be more expensive than the standard edition and may be 5.5-inches or larger, says Nikkei Asian Review, while other analysts point to a 5.8-inch screen for this premium version. Apple is said to have recently ordered enough flexible OLED for mass production of the next iPhone, as the Journal reports. In May, a gadget leaker who has been accurate in the past shared a rendering of what the next iPhone might look like. However, he cautioned that this may not match the final result because Apple is testing multiple prototype designs. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September, but that could change this year, according to a report from Chinese news outlet Economic Daily News. The company’s new smartphones may go on sale starting in October, although Apple is still likely to unveil them during an event in September. Those hoping to snag Apple’s top tier smartphone when it launches may have to shell out upwards of $1,000, reports Fast Company. That price tag will apply to the most expensive iPhone model (of three Apple is expected to launch later this year), which is said to have an OLED screen. The report didn’t specify whether that price refers to entry level cost for the OLED iPhone 8, or the version with the most storage space. Apple could add facial recognition to its upcoming iPhone, according to Cowen and Company’s Timothy Arcuri. In a note, which Apple Insider published, Arcuri predicts Apple may place an infrared sensor next to the front-facing camera to enable the phone to recognize a user’s face. Separately, Digitimes has reported that Apple plans to add an iris scanner to its next iPhone, although it’s worth noting the website hasn’t always been accurate about future Apple products in the past. Samsung introduced a similar feature on its ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, which included an iris scanner that allowed owners to unlock their phone just by looking at it. Apple may also add 3D-sensing technology to its high-end next generation iPhone, which could be used for anything from facial recognition to allowing the camera to capture sharper photos, or for augmented reality, according to Fast Company. Apple traditionally releases its new iPhones on a tick-tock cycle, either giving them a title that includes just a number or a number paired with an “S.” For its next iPhone, however, the company may break this habit by simply calling it iPhone X, as Loup Venture’s Gene Munster predicts. “Apple will likely break from its historical naming convention and call this iPhone something other than iPhone 7S or iPhone 8 because it will be the 10th anniversary iPhone,” Munster writes. “Like they did with the 10th version of the Mac OS, it seems logical that they’ll call the next iPhone: iPhone X.” Not all predictions align with Munster’s: multiple reports from Bloomberg and other outlets suggest Apple’s refreshed lineup could include three new iPhones rather than two: a 4.7-inch iPhone 7s, 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus and totally revamped 5.8-inch OLED iPhone 8. Apple hasn’t significantly redesigned its iPhone since it unveiled the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. That could change in 2017. The company reportedly plans to overhaul the next iPhone with a new design that includes an edge-to-edge glass screen and no home button, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Touch ID fingerprint sensor, meanwhile, could be built directly into the iPhone’s screen. But Apple may still be in the process of figuring out how to work the fingerprint sensor into the front of a home-button-less iPhone. The company is weighing three options, says Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri according to a Barron’s report. These methods include using a different type of sensor that could be integrated into the screen, thinning the cover glass over the area that would include the sensor, or inserting a pinhole into the glass for fingerprint reading. Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with KGI Securities, offered an idea for how Apple may fill the space underneath the screen where the home button currently sits. The company could place virtual buttons in this area dedicated to specific tasks, Kuo said in a note published by Apple Insider. Kuo calls this the “function area,” and it sounds similar to the capacitive buttons found on some Android phones like the Galaxy S7. While Samsung’s phone has a physical home button, flat keys for browsing through currently open apps and navigating backward appear below the screen as needed. Further changes could include a frame made of stainless steel and glass, according to Bloomberg. Future iPhone owners may not have to plug their phones into a power cord to charge it. Apple is said to be testing wireless charging technology that could appear in iPhones as soon as 2017, according to reports from Bloomberg and Nikkei Asian Review. Wireless charging has existed in certain Android smartphones for years, but Apple could be exploring a method that makes it possible to power iPhones from a distance, Bloomberg reports. It’s unclear how close that technology is to a commercial release, however. Apple may ditch the iPhone’s Lightning port in favor of USB-C, according to The Wall Street Journal. This could more closely align Apple’s next smartphone with its recent Mac laptops, which only include USB-C ports.

Sony boss Andrew House kicked off the show by leaping straight to the revised system, which he said would be “slimmer, lighter, more energy efficient” than the current model, which hasn’t changed since its launch in November 2013. The slimmer PlayStation 4 will be the “standard” PlayStation 4 moving forward, said House, and it’s designed “to appeal to as wide an audience as possible.” It’ll be available by September 15 for most markets, and Sony’s going to sell it for $299, or $50 less than the current model’s $350 price tier. PlayStation 4 system architect Mark Cerny then confirmed the existent of PlayStation Pro, Sony’s souped-up, razzle-dazzle followup to its not quite three years old PlayStation 4 games console. Cerny said the new system more than doubles the power of the console’s GPU, which is based on AMD’s Polaris architecture. They’re also boosting the clock rate of the CPU and including a 1 terabyte hard drive. The system will be able to “reach resolutions not thought to be possible on console in 2016,” added Cerny. Cerny then showed footage from several games running on the Pro, including Insomniac’s forthcoming Spider-Man game, Square Enix’s recently released Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Square Enix’s forthcoming Rise of the Tomb Raider (released last year as a timed-exclusive for Microsoft’s Xbox One) and an extended glimpse of Watch Dogs 2. All save Spider-Man represent Sony taking existing titles and cranking up the resolution. PlayStation Pro won’t be merely a shift to higher 4K-angled resolutions, said Cerny. It’ll also allow developers to retroactively upgrade older titles for existing 1080p TVs, say making scenes more visually complex without sacrificing performance. Sony calls this process “forward compatibility,” and Cerny says patches for over a half-dozen first party titles are in the offing, as well as several from third party developers. Crucial to Sony’s strategy not to balkanize its considerable PlayStation 4 base, now boasting over 40 million users, Sony says disc-based games and downloads must run on both the standard PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Pro. Sony says it’s also asking (though not requiring) publishers and developers to support games on both standard and 4K high-definition TVs when they launch. Sony also confirmed a new 4K-focused Netflix app would launch with PlayStation Pro, and that 600 hours of 4K content will be available on Netflix by the end of 2016. And in what seemed a response to Microsoft’s recent launch of its HDR-enabled Xbox One S, Sony says it’ll be making every PlayStation 4 HDR-capable by dint of a firmware upgrade next week. And last but not least, Sony revealed the new PlayStation Pro will launch this year, November 10, for $399, and that you can lay hands on the new slim-sized PlayStation 4, for $299, on September 15.

{"type": "article", "header": "10 Incredible Experiences I Had Playing the Final Oculus Rift", "author": "Matt Peckham", "update_date/publish_date": "March 16, 2016 10:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4259799/oculus-rift-virtual-reality-games/", "text": "The opening salvo in the high-fidelity, high-price virtual reality wars kicks off in less than two weeks, when Oculus VR rolls out its $600 Rift headset to consumers. TIME spent a day at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco test-driving the final version of Rift, and some of the experiences you can expect to have when it launches on March 28.   Futuristic race cars hurtle over pulsing tubes that snake through 3D-space with hazards you can only anticipate if you snap your view toward the ceiling. Except there is no ceiling, because this is Radial-G: Racing Revolved on Oculus Rift, the virtual reality version of Tammeka Games’ breakneck anti-grav racer staged on tracks that weave crazily through a derelict asteroid mining station. Its twice-Bafta-nominated producer Sam Watts told me the game took some 4,000 human hours to make, and that the VR version—a non-VR version for PC launched in December 2014—has been in the works for more than two years. It’s also one of less than a dozen launch titles to earn an Oculus “Intense” comfort rating, though Watts told me the studio came up with some clever field-of-view tricks to mitigate queasiness when you’re executing barf-prone maneuvers. Radial-G launches on March 28 for $24.99.  Hand over hand, ledge by crack, I’m pulling myself along the face of a rust-red cliff that soars thousands of feet above anything like safe ground. I swivel my head and there’s a view that makes me think of the Paramount Pictures logo: a hyper-majestic Olympian mountain aglow in the engine’s killer sunset. I’m playing The Climb, studio Crytek’s thrilling rock-climbing game for Oculus Rift, feeling simultaneously contemplative and scared you-know-what-less. The Climb uses the Rift’s forthcoming Oculus Touch, a pair of bracelet-sized controllers you hold, one in each hand, to simulate that signature primate feature: opposable thumbs. In the game, they control a pair of virtual hands you can move freely along a cliff wall, reaching for handholds identified by faint chalk lines. Hit a dead end and you may have to jump, terrifying lurch-of-faith moments that had me gasping repeatedly. Or dangle from one hand for too long, and you’ll lose your grip (and maybe your lunch), plummeting backwards into the waiting arms of a blessed checkpoint reload. The Climb arrives in April for $49.99.  If there’s a point that spending the day with an Oculus Rift strapped to your face reinforces, it’s that sufficiently conveying the experience of virtual reality with mere words is impossible. In videos, Lucky’s Tale looks like any other cutesy 3D game where you dash and jump between platforms. But pull on the Rift, and there’s no way to translate what happens, save that buzzwords like “presence” become eerily accurate, the immediacy of being a movable head inside a box of wonders driven home by your ability to scoot towards or crane your neck over or peer around the corner of virtually anything at all. So imagine, if you can, the extraordinary feeling that arises when you can lean down until your face is inches from Lucky, the game’s anthropometric fox-hero. Do so and he’ll “notice” you, then mug for…well, it’s not really the camera, because now your head’s doing the looking instead of your fingers waggling a joystick. And it’s that ability to perceive objects in uncanny detail up close, or perceive them from any direction by subtly shifting your head just as you would in real life, that finally overwhelms your brain’s logic centers, immersing you completely in studio Playful’s dazzling carnival of the imagination. Lucky’s Tale comes bundled with the Rift at launch on March 28. When I heard that someone at Oculus VR had gone nearly prone playing Dead & Buried to dodge bullets, I scoffed—until I wound up doing the same thing myself instinctively. In fact I found myself doing a form of instant-yoga as I played Oculus Studios’ ghostly arcade shooter, which pits teams of two against each other in Western-inspired settings wielding pistols, futuristic rifles and fizzing sticks of dynamite. Reach for your holsters using the Oculus Touch controls and you’ll draw a pair of guns that reload by snap-swiveling your wrists. Or grab a stick of dynamite off the rail you’re crouching behind, then wing it at your target like a pitcher hurling a ball. And since the Rift’s cameras keep track of where the headset is in the environment, you can use cover just as you would in real life, crouching to reduce visibility and leaning left or right to around rails or support beams to pop off shots while avoiding damage. Dead & Buried doesn’t have a release date or price yet, but should appear when Oculus Touch arrives in the second half of 2016.  Finally, a game that had me reaching for handfuls of the ginger chews Oculus kindly situated around their demo rooms. Ubisoft’s Eagle Flight lets you pretend you’re a bird of prey soaring over a near-future version of Paris devoid of humans (I didn’t catch why, nor did I much care, since it’s probably just a narrative excuse to lay off already hyper-stressed PC graphics processors). After spending 30 minutes arrowing over a stunning reproduction of the Ile de la Cite, all I can say is that if this doesn’t make you at least a trifle green, you’re not of this world. Learning to fly happens even more instinctually than the first time we all hefted a Wiimote. Move a dot on screen with your head and you fly in that direction, or tilt left or right and you’ll turn respectively. You can go faster and slower, or fire the equivalent of a shockwave blast (dubbed an “eagle scream”) at other eagles by tapping a button. And the game’s 3-versus-3 multiplayer mode, where each side tries to snatch a rabbit and schlep it to a distant nest without crashing or being shot, made Eagle Flight the only game you could easily hear people playing between floors, so loud were the cries of frustration or triumph. Eagle Flight doesn’t have a price yet, but Ubisoft says it’ll ship sometime this fall.  It’s the kitchen of the future meets a recipe book of the uncanny. I kid not, by the time I’d finished playing Owlchemy Labs’ clever, quirky demo for Oculus Touch showcase Job Simulator, I’d whipped up a can of “magazine, compact disc and cookbook“ soup for some unfortunate soul, who I can only presume ate it. Imagine the kitchen transformer Hasbro has yet to make, wrapped around you, a solo robotic line chef who can summon unique cook-spaces and appliances with the flip of a dial. Snatch slips of paper off an order wheel with your virtual hands, then follow recipe instructions—or take them creatively sideways by adding “extra” nearby ingredients—to craft delicacies along a spectrum that ranges from the tasteful to the tastefully bizarre. Job Simulator doesn’t have a release date or price yet, but should appear when Oculus Touch arrives in the second half of 2016. A real-time strategy virtual reality game? Did someone get hit over the head before green-lighting this thing? No? Well thank goodness, because playing an RTS like a tabletop game looks pretty dang cool, even if the interface for zipping around the battlefield needs work. That may be partly because AirMech: Command predates virtual reality, one of the Rift launch titles that’s been ported over rather than being designed from the ground up for VR. It’s a real-time action game in the online battle arena mold where you play a transforming robot that can shift between bipedal and flying forms, snatching up allied units to redistribute around the battlefield in the latter. Getting to lean in and see your unit squads trundling around like toy soldiers is both startling and incredibly satisfying. All studio Carbon Games needs to do is figure out a way to make panning around the battlefield smoother, since at this point you can only do it spasmodically by tapping a button to re-center the camera on your robotic avatar. AirMech: Command launches on March 28 for $39.99.  Who doesn’t want a giant killer robot virtual reality game? Answer: the little guy who has to fend off all those giants. Damaged Core lets you play as both, but not at first. And boy is it chilling watching evil Terminator-esque robots twice your size arc fluidly over your head, thrusters firing as they land, then lumber towards you, guns-a-blazing. But target key areas on some of the biggest enemies and you can “possess” their sparking husks, teleporting across the field of battle by “looking” at a target, then towering several stories above foes as you unleash geysers of destruction. You’re more like a turret than a robot, incapable of locomotion as you leap from host to host, but capable of swiveling 360 degrees (by simply moving your head) to spray enemies with bullets and more. Just don’t let your host body die, else you have seconds to find another to leap into—including any of several strategic battlefield cameras—before the screen goes black. Damaged Core doesn’t have a price yet, but High Voltage says it’ll ship sometime this spring.   Playing Gunfire Games’ Chronos had me thinking what might happen if you married Alone in the Dark to ICO, then dropped players’ heads into the space where the fixed cameras would be. It’s a third-person roleplaying game, only you watch your hero navigate each screen from a static position that automatically shifts as you cross invisible thresholds between one area and the next. While in that position, since this is virtual reality, you can peer in any direction, sticking your head out from under a ledge to eyeball the panoramic sweep of stratospheric cliffs, or notice a pair of smoldering yellow eyeballs waiting in the darkness at stage left or right. The other twist is how the game handles dying: each time you perish, your character ages a year, though the person demonstrating the game admitted his desire to make it a serious caveat—to let players age right out of the game—was overruled by his teammates, so it’s apparently more a vanity thing. Chronos launches on March 28 for $49.99.   Oddly my favorite Oculus Rift demo, Defense Grid 2 is another virtual reality port of an existing tower defense game. But again, as with AirMech: Command, the allure is how simple and intuitive it is to stick your face right down in the action, scrutinizing intricate sci-fi battlefields littered with marching, ant-like robots trying to bypass your matrix of defensive turrets from any angle. The VR version adds something essential you don’t fully realize was missing from this sort of game until you’ve yanked off the headset and looked at the standard flat-screen version, which now feels lifeless by comparison. I hate to use that buzzword again, “presence,” but there it is. And with a tower defense game, where you’re already meant to hover and peruse and fuss over each level’s splendid minutia, it’s as natural and simultaneously uncanny as watching a real-world diorama come to life. Defense Grid 2: Enhanced VR Edition launches on March 28 for $29.99.

The company on Thursday unveiled a new version of the MacBook Pro with a thin touch display that sits above the keyboard. This screen, called the Touch Bar, will offer different “keys” depending on the app that’s being used, effectively eliminating the need for a row of function keys, or F-keys. This new 13-inch MacBook Pro will start at $1,799, while the 15-inch version will start at $2,399. Both are available for preorder starting immediately, and will begin shipping in the next two to three weeks. By default, the Touch Bar will display the array of controls Mac owners are used to seeing on their keyboards, like playback and brightness controls. But those options will change depending on the current software being used. When browsing through your email inbox, for example, the Touch Bar will show buttons for flagging emails or replying to messages. It can also show suggestions as you type, similar to how the iPhone keyboard behaves. That same Touch Bar will display commands for answering or declining a caller when receiving an incoming FaceTime call. Shortcuts like these will pop up on the Touch Bar while using Apple’s array of apps like Photos, Safari, Maps, and GarageBand, among others. MacBook Pro owners will be able to customize the Touch Bar by dragging and dropping options down from the screen to the touch strip. Apple is promoting the Touch Bar as an especially useful tool for photo and video editing. As shown in a demonstration on stage, the Touch Bar will show different shortcuts and editing options depending on the specific task. This can range from changing the size of a brush in Photoshop to displaying a timeline for a project in Final Cut Pro. Microsoft is also updating its suite of Office apps to be compatible with the Touch Bar. Apple is also bringing Touch ID to the Mac, making it possible to log in to your computer by resting your finger on the sensor. If multiple users have accounts on the same MacBook Pro, they can use their fingerprint to quickly swap between logins. The company says this is the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro it has ever made. The Force Touch trackpad on the new MacBook Pro is also twice as large as that of the previous generation MacBook Pro. The same second-generation butterfly mechanism keyboard from the 12-inch MacBook is making its way to the new Pro in the upcoming model. The new MacBook Pro’s display is also 67% brighter and shows 25% more color than Apple’s previous generation Pro laptop. Performance is getting an all-around boost on both models, and both notebooks deliver all day battery life and come with improved speakers. Apple is also releasing a new MacBook Pro that won’t include the Touch Bar starting at $1,499. This model, launching immediately, is aimed at those who would typically be interested in the MacBook Air. Here’s a closer look at the specifications for each model of the new MacBook Pro: <img class=”wp-image-4548248 size-portrait_small_2x” src=”https://time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/new-macbook-pro-specs.png?w=560&#8243; alt=”Apple” width=”560″ height=”315″ /> <span class=”credit”>Apple</span> Apple is also offering its 12-inch MacBook, with no Touch Bar, starting at $1,299.

The Cupertino, Calif.’s automotive team is shifting to a strategy that emphasizes creating software for self-driving cars rather than building an actual vehicle, Bloomberg reports. Apple may seek to partner with, rather than compete with, existing automakers. Apple is said to have cut hundreds of members from its car team in the process of changing its focus. Some have been reassigned to other teams within the company, while others have been let go or have chosen to depart, per Bloomberg. The company’s automotive team, whose efforts have been referred to as “Project Titan,” has been given a deadline of late 2017 to prove that its plans are worth continuing. An Apple representative declined to comment for this story. The pivot is another indicator that Apple has been running into roadblocks when it comes to its automotive efforts. Apple began pivoting its focus from building a vehicle to self-driving technology in July, when it tapped company veteran Bob Mansfield to oversee the project, according to a Bloomberg report at the time. Then, in September, Apple reportedly laid off dozens of employees after shuttering parts of its self-driving car program. Bloomberg’s July report indicated the Project Titan team may have had trouble meeting the initial launch target of 2020 due to technical delays, departures, and confusion about the project’s direction. The most significant team member to depart was Steve Zadesky, a 16-year Apple veteran who initially lead the effort but who left the company in January. Apple’s shift comes as other technology companies are also pursuing self-driving car technology. Uber launched a pilot program in Pittsburgh last month to test pickups with self-driving cars.

You check the message and decide to dash off a quick reply. But then things get complicated. There’s cutting, pasting, and backspacing. You wish you had replied on your Mac, which is two feet away — but it might as well be two miles from you, because there’s no way you’re abandoning this half-written response. Handoff, a new feature in OS X Yosemite, makes it possible to quit thumb-strumming that iPhone email and pick it up on your computer, exactly where you left off. Here’s how to make it work. Step 1: Get the Gear It wouldn’t be an Apple innovation if it didn’t leave some users feeling left out in the cold. Apple hasn’t posted any technical specifications for Handoff, but the key requirement seems to be that every device needs to have Bluetooth 4.0, also known as Bluetooth LE. This low-energy Bluetooth allows the iPhones, iPads, and Macs to connect to each other wirelessly without eating away at your battery in the process. Compatible Macs include those released between mid-2012 and now. On iOS, compatible devices include iPhones as old as the 4s, the fourth generation iPad, both iPad Airs, all the iPad Mini models, and even the fifth generation iPod Touch. If you have those any of those, make sure your Bluetooth connectivity is turned on in Settings on the iOS hardware and in the System Preferences on your Mac. Also, your iDevices need to have iOS 8 installed. Step 2: Log Into iCloud Using the same Apple ID login, sign into Apple’s iCloud services on your computer, phone and/or tablet. (Note: After following all these steps, if your Handoff-compatible devices still don’t detect the feature, logging out of iCloud on the Mac, iPhone and/or iPad is a good way to “reset” the computers’ connection to this service. Then, once they are all disconnected from iCloud, wait about ten seconds, and log them back in.) Step 3: Turn On Handoff For such a heralded new feature, Handoff’s settings are buried pretty deep in the devices’ preferences. But because of Apple’s “it just works” mentality, it’s possible that the service has already activated on your devices by default. On your Mac, open the System Preferences, click on General, and then look near the bottom of the window to toggle on “Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices.” If the option isn’t there, then your computer isn’t compatible with Handoff. On your handheld Apple gear, tap on Settings, then General, and finally Handoff & Suggested Apps. Toggle the Handoff switch to the “on” (or green) position. Below that setting on iOS, there are also toggles for Suggested Apps. These allow other, unfamiliar computers to suggest apps to you in a manner that’s similar to how Handoff works. For example, if you’re at Starbucks, the store’s computer can push their app to your lock screen, “suggesting” you download and use it for convenience’s sake. But some users may feel like this is pushy or a privacy issue — those people should switch the bottom two toggles to “off.” Disabling Suggested Apps will not affect using Handoff on your personal computer. Step 4: Watch For Handoff Icons If all of the background technology did what it’s supposed to, Handoff is activated and already operating. You’ll know because app icons will start popping up in new places. For example, when you’re browsing the web on your iPhone, a Safari icon with a tiny iPhone badge will appear to the left of the Finder icon in the Mac’s dock. Alternatively, if you were on your computer working on a spreadsheet in Numbers, upon waking your iPad you’d find a small Numbers icon at the bottom left of the iOS lock screen (if the Numbers app is installed on your iPad). Swipe that icon up (or click on the Dock icon on your Mac), and it will open not only the app, but also the spreadsheet you were working on at the computer. Or, if your iOS device is already unlocked, double-tap the home button to open the App Switcher, then swipe right, past the home screen, and you’ll get a second chance to hand off your computer’s app to your handheld. Handoff isn’t just a hack for Apple-made programs; it currently works on a small but growing number of third party iOS apps, including news apps VICE News and the NYTimes (which open the Grey Lady’s stories in Safari on the Mac) and Wunderlist (which has both OS X and iOS apps). But there will certainly be more uses for this technology to come as developers get their hands dirty coding more Handoff-enabled apps.

When speaking with The Washington Post in August, Cook referred to augmented reality as a “core technology” and “something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain we talked about.” Cook also said Apple is “high on augmented reality for the long run” during the company’s earnings call this summer. Much of this excitement came following the success of Pokémon Go, which launched in July. A previous report from The Financial Times also suggested Apple has been building a team to work on an augmented reality headset. The introduction of smart glasses would mark the first time Apple has expanded into a new product category since it unveiled the Apple Watch in 2014. Apple declined to comment for this story.

Even Apple has embraced USB-C in its updated line of MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops, all of which include USB-C ports only.

The news comes after the Journal reported in November that Apple had been considering such a change. Nikkei Asian Review also said in August that Apple will release a new iPhone model with a curved screen. This could enable Apple to better compete with rival Samsung, which has been releasing smartphones with rounded screens since 2014.

Microsoft unveiled the HoloLens during a Windows 10 press conference at its Redmond, Washington headquarters on Wednesday. Rather than immerse the user in a digital fantasy world, like the Oculus Rift, the HoloLens overlays 3-D images on top of real-world surroundings, blurring the line between fantasy and reality. No recording devices were allowed into the demonstration rooms, which were hidden beneath the ground floor of Microsoft’s Visitor Center and secured behind locked doors. Unlike the sleek, donut-shaped headset unveiled on stage, the prototypes in the demonstration were skeletal contraptions that wrapped around the cranium and included a small computer slung around the neck. The weight was easy to ignore once the technicians fired up a game of Minecraft and the game’s fantasy world sprawled out over real world living room furniture. As the headset’s spatial sensors scanned their surroundings, a pulse of blue light passed over the tabletop and slipped around the corners. Suddenly a slightly translucent image of a castle rose from the tabletop. Beneath it, a pool of blue water was spread across the floor and thumb-sized sheep grazed at the water’s edge. The images are projected directly into the user’s eye and precisely turn with the user’s movements. While the images appear to fade away at the periphery, a turn of the head quickly fills in the blank with new terrain. Users can interact with their surroundings by training their eyes on any object of interest, holding out a pointer finger and “air tapping” it with a downward flick. Air tap a holographic shovel, for instance, and it punches a hole through the coffee table. A soft beam of light passes through the opening and casts a bright patch on the floor. The holes can offer keyhole glimpses into new terrains. Beneath the side table was a lake of lava. After a blowing a hole through the wall, a passageway to a cave opened, complete with bats flitting back out towards the user. But the highlight of the demonstration had to be the bizarre-yet-satisfying pleasure of tickling miniature sheep across a table, and watching one poor creature take a lemming-like leap over the table’s edge. The second demonstration suspended a Skype video screen in mid-air. The caller, a Microsoft engineer, shared my view on her screen and directed me toward a scattering of tools. She then guided me through a real world installation of a light switch, with her drawing holographic arrows at the tools I needed each step of the way. It worked, and it showcased the HoloLens ability to stick an expert into a novice’s field of vision, instantly eliminating the skills gap. A third demonstration projected photographic landscapes of Mars, snapped by NASA’s mars rover, in a surprisingly crisp image of its cracked and rocky surface. Microsoft has partnered with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab to simulate exploratory missions on Mars. A real-world monitor showed the two-dimensional landscape on a conventional screen, but pull the mouse cursor beyond the screen’s edge and it floats seamlessly into the 3-dimensional landscape, where a mouse click can plant a holographic flag into the ground. A final demonstration showed how models can be constructed in space, by pinching pre-fabricated shapes, rotating them and gluing them together. A “perfect print preview for 3-D printing,” explained a Microsoft engineer as a coworker put the finishing touches on a koala wearing a space helmet. Moments later they distributed 3-D printed models of the same koala in a goodie bag. To be sure, these were highly stage managed interactions with the HoloLens, and it remains to be seen how it will fare for the average consumer. When that will happen remains an open question. The HoloLens has been under development for at least five years, and its lead inventor, Alex Kipman, said the product would release sometime “within the Windows 10 timeframe,” which could mean a matter of years. Still, the technology is mind-bendingly cool. If the experiences in the demonstration rooms can be carried over into the real world, Microsoft may have a shot at reclaiming the mobile market, leapfrogging over the current jumble of smartphones, tablets and phablets, and into the next generation of augmented reality.

Project lead Alex Kipman, who unveiled the HoloLens in January, took the stage at Microsoft’s BUILD conference Wednesday to offer a preview of Windows 10 running on the new device. In a mock-up of a living room, a developer wearing the headset pulled up three holographic windows that hung like framed pictures on the wall. “Instead of digging through menus, everything is right where he wants it,” Kipman said as the developer walked around the space and the windows appeared to adjust to his viewing angle. The developer pulled up new apps by air-tapping a floating start menu. The demonstration showed off how easily HoloLens wearers can move Windows apps around a physical space. A media player, for instance, could be detached from the wall with one tap. The voice command, “follow me,” made the floating app glide behind the user, ready to be pinned and scaled on another wall. “Every single universal Windows app has the same capabilities,” said Kipman to the Windows developers gathered in the crowd, an audience that’s crucial to Microsoft’s attempt at re-thinking how computing might work in three dimensions. The HoloLens’ real test will come once the “wow” factor of a floating operating system wears thin and developers begin cooking up new ways to use the device. At Wednesday’s event, Microsoft revealed two groups of test users, one made up of students and one of architects, are working with the HoloLens team to come up with new uses for the device. The architects have been able to build and share blueprints in three dimensions, scaling up the models to take walking tours through their designs. Case Western Reserve University’s Dr. Mark Griswold, meanwhile, was invited on stage to show how medical students could use the HoloLens in lieu of cadavers. A holographic body could be separated into bones, muscles and arteries, and animations could give students their first look at the inside of a beating heart without using a scalpel. “This could change how everyone learns,” Griswold said. “Chemistry and genetics, art, engineering, and paleontology.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.09241973304473301, "subjectivity_score": 0.4466901154401155},
{"type": "article", "header": "11 Things We Learned By Trying Every Virtual Reality Headset Out There", "author": "TIME Staff", "update_date/publish_date": "August 6, 2015 7:30 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/3986185/virtual-reality-headset/", "text": "In the August 17 cover story of TIME, we take a deep look at the mainstreaming of virtual reality, the long-promised technology that is now becoming widely available to consumers. Headsets from Facebook’s Oculus, Valve, Sony, Microsoft, Google and many others will start going on sale this year, and competition will increase dramatically through 2016. Throughout this year, we set out to try every major in-development headset out there. These devices promise to change not only entertainment, but education, health, and work. Here’s some of what we learned: 1. Palmer Luckey, the creator of the Oculus Rift, is not your typical nerd… He’s cheery and talks in normal sentences that are easy to understand. He was homeschooled, and though he did drop out of college, it was California State University, Long Beach, where he was majoring not in computer science but in journalism. He prefers shorts, and his feet are black because he doesn’t like wearing shoes, even outdoors. He doesn’t look like a guy who played Dungeons & Dragons so much as a character in Dungeons & Dragons. He’s a nerd from a different century, working on the problems of a different century. 2. …and he kicked off this revolution by tinkering in his garage. As an 18-year-old who took apart smartphones and fixed them for cash, Luckey figured out that the solutions to the problems virtual-reality engineers weren’t able to solve were right inside his phone. Now 22, he sold his company, Oculus VR, to Facebook last year for $2.3 billion, allowing it to grow to more than 350 employees in offices in Silicon Valley, Seattle, Dallas and Austin as well as in South Korea and Japan. That’s because, as fantastical as Luckey’s dreams were, Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of the tech industry had a much bigger hope for the sensory-­immersion goggles Luckey used to carry around in a yellow bucket in order to hold loose wires. They had seen the Internet get disrupted by mobile and were wary of being blindsided by the next platform for accessing ­information—which they think might just have been hiding in Luckey’s yellow bucket. (Here’s how Mark Zuckerberg explains VR.) 3. Silicon Valley is pouring money into the concept like crazy. Venture capitalist Mike Rothenberg, who runs a VR accelerator, says his firm has already secured enough money to invest in a second round of virtual-reality companies this fall. “It’s hard for people to write checks for virtual reality until they try it. Then, not that hard,” he says. He likens this opportunity to the Internet in 1995. “No one calls a company an ‘Internet company’ anymore. In 10 years, everyone will have VR as part of their company.” 4. But Luckey doesn’t feel pressure to bring out the Rift by Christmas, even though others will have come out by then. “If the iPhone were introduced in any quarter, it would have been a hit. I doubt they were saying, ‘What’s important for the iPhone? We have to hit Christmas,’” says Luckey about letting his ­competition beat him to market. 5. Google already has a low-tech version, dubbed Cardboard (because that’s what it’s made of), on the market. Through a program called Expeditions, Google has already sent 100 classrooms a field trip in a box; teachers use Cardboards to lead kids through natural, architectural and Martian wonders. The company worked with partners like the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural History to create 3-D images not unlike those in the plastic viewfinders that were popular in the 1970s. This comparison isn’t lost on Google, which has a deal with Mattel to put out a version of Google Cardboard in a View-Master. 6. Valve, the gaming company that will be first of the high-end manufactures to market with its Vive headset this year, is full of true believers who can’t wait for you to get your hands on VR. The Vive is different because it lets you walk around in a virtual environment, rather than staying seated in your chair. The headset alerts you when you’re near a wall, but it requires you to have a 16-by-12-ft. (5 by 4 m) empty room in your house. Jeep Barnett, who has worked on the project from the beginning, isn’t worried. “Sell your dining-room table and eat over your sink,” he says. “If you have a pool table, get rid of that. Get a Murphy bed. People are going to find a space. You have a space for your car because you have to have the superpower of getting downtown in 20 minutes.” 7. Sony, which also has a headset coming out for the Playstation 4, says the hardware is becoming less important than the software. Richard Marks, a senior researcher at Sony, says that in the past few months it has gotten the hardware far enough along that the software will now matter more. Already, he says, what game designers call “talent amplification” is more impressive than he imagined. “I can point at something and have the force and levitate it, and it really feels like I’m doing it. When you play a game, you say, ‘I died.’ But in virtual reality, man, it’s even more powerful.” I try a few more games before I’m ushered out so they can clear the room for a VIP. As I walk out, Steven ­Spielberg walks in. 8. Some of the coolest applications have nothing to do with gaming. In the most impressive virtual-­reality experience I have, I use a program called Tilt Brush (since purchased by Google, which has a bunch of high-end virtual-reality projects it’s keeping quiet) to paint in three dimensions. Walking around dripping neon, I paint in the sky in a way that makes me never need to try LSD. 9. Microsoft is trying to leapfrog everybody else with its own Hololens, which is technically augmented reality since it projects holograms onto the real world. Alex Kipman is in charge of the Hololens, having overseen Microsoft Kinect, the Xbox add-on that allowed people to control what happens onscreen by waving their hands and using their voices, like in Minority Report. When the first version of Kinect was released five years ago, it was the coolest thing Micro­soft had ever made. Kipman is also cool. He’s got a Brazilian accent and dresses like a man who takes Burning Man seriously: shiny gray pants; a long jacket with embroidery; blunt, shoulder-length hair. “If I told people at Microsoft I wanted to make virtual reality, they would have nodded their head yes,” he says. But Kipman wants to save us from spending yet more time on our computers instead of with one another. “Virtual reality is not embracing that which makes us human. Kinect was about ­embracing what’s in all of us. Humans exist in the real world. Holograms say, ‘Hey, technology has become sophisticated enough today that we’re ready to go beyond being stuck behind pixels all day long.’” Holograms, he believes, will reverse our isolation and inactivity. 10. There’s debate within the community about what VR is really good for. Jeremy Bailenson, who founded Stanford’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab in 2003, doesn’t think that his life’s work is the final platform. He thinks people will get hurt walking into walls or when a dog darts across the room. He thinks the glasses will never be comfortable to wear for long periods. And that an all-virtual world is creepy. “I’m actually a Luddite. I don’t play video games. I don’t have a Facebook account,” he says. At the Tribeca Film Festival’s symposium on virtual reality this year, he warned the audience against making entertainment for virtual reality. “Do you want to be in the trash compactor in Star Wars? No, you don’t. If Jaws felt like what you just did in my lab, no one would ever go in the ocean again.” VR, he believes, is an empathy machine and should be saved for that purpose. 11. Hollywood also has had mixed reactions. But when one VR pioneer showed virtual reality to director James Cameron—the technology-pushing cre­ator of Avatar, Titanic and Terminator—in May 2013, Cameron stated that he had no use for it. “This has very little to do with controlling the viewers’ attention,” says a colleague. “It’s not necessarily a medium for filmmakers.” For more on VR, read the cover story and check out: — Watch the Demo That Will Make You Want Virtual Reality Right Now — This Is When Sony’s Virtual Reality Headset Is Coming Out — Here’s When You Can Buy Oculus’s Long-Awaited Virtual Reality Headset Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3987022/why-virtual-reality-is-about-to-change-the-world/", "http://time.com/39577/facebook-oculus-vr-inside-story/", "http://time.com/3919120/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-virtual-reality-oculus-rift/", "http://time.com/2923531/google-cardboard-app/", "http://time.com/3966151/valve-vive-controller/", "http://time.com/31869/sonys-project-morpheus-virtual-reality-headset-10-things-to-know/", "http://time.com/3677905/hololens-mars-nasa-microsoft/", "http://time.com/3987022/why-virtual-reality-is-about-to-change-the-world/", "http://time.com/3965843/portal-vr-demo/", "http://time.com/3921168/sony-project-morpheus-vr/", "http://time.com/3918081/oculus-rift-release-date-microsoft/"], "sentiment_score": 0.12451529205561457, "subjectivity_score": 0.5037526093977706},

Thanks to the rise of Chromebooks, it’s easier than ever to find a basic yet functional laptop for less than $400. But while Chromebooks have improved significantly over the last five years, buying one still means making tradeoffs. Chromebooks are (typically) inexpensive, but their Chrome OS operating system can’t handle demanding software like Photoshop or complex video games. And aside from Google’s pricey $1,299 Pixel, some models feel cheap compared to Windows and Mac laptops. Recently, however, Google and its partners have strived to make Chromebooks feel more like full-fledged PCs. A standout example is HP’s new Chromebook 13, among the few such computers to feature a polished, refined design that feels more like an Apple product. Google also recently announced that Android apps are coming to the Chrome ecosystem, giving some Chromebook owners plenty of new software to use. The new hardware and the incoming bounty of apps make the case for buying a Chromebook stronger than ever. But these inexpensive machines still aren’t for everybody. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use the HP Chromebook 13 for the past several days. Hardware When closed, the Chromebook 13 looks like a flat, sleek sheet of aluminum. As you lift the lid and power it on, the backlit keyboard begins to gleam. These are superficial details, but they’re a refreshing change from the plethora of plasticky Chromebooks out there. Still, this quality comes at a cost: depending on which configuration you choose, the Chromebook 13 can cost anywhere between $500 and $800. That’s on par with some mid-range Windows devices. The $500 entry level version is powered by an Intel Pentium processor, comes with 32GB of storage, 4GB of memory, and has a 13.3-inch 3,200×1,800 resolution screen. Paying $600 gets you a Core m3 processor, but leaves the same storage, memory, and display. For $819, you get a more powerful Core m5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and the same display and amount of storage. Further customization options allow you to swap out the processor and upgrade to a Core m7, choose a lower resolution 1920×1080 screen, or add more memory. Who’s it for? HP’s Chromebook 13 is suitable for most work-related tasks and casual needs. I used it as my primary work computer for two days, and found it was sufficient for handling most of my daily responsibilities, like writing, editing, researching, and communicating with coworkers. Chromebooks tend to rely heavily on the Internet, but I barely noticed when my Chromebook 13 lost its connection — Google Drive and Gmail, among other apps, have workable offline modes. In a nod to office workers, the Chromebook 13 supports virtual desktop software for accessing workplace programs remotely. But connecting the Chromebook 13 to a larger external monitor means buying an adapter or a dock — HP sells one for $149. Testing it out The Chromebook 13 is (mostly) a pleasure to use. The spacious keyboard, with its deep key travel, provides rich and tactile feedback that makes it easy to type quickly. It doesn’t feel flimsy or mushy when you press down on the keys, as is the case with some cheaper notebooks. The screen is crisp and clear enough to make for an enjoyable viewing experience when watching Netflix or viewing photos. My two complaints: The Chromebook 13’s screen can catch distracting glare, making it harder to view. Meanwhile, the touchpad’s mouse button felt clunky and sticky, requiring a harder press than usual to register a click. That sounds minor, but it grew irritating after a few days of use. The Chromebook 13’s battery lasted long enough to get me through nearly an entire workday. I was able to use the computer for roughly seven and a half hours before it died, which is on par with competitors like the Toshiba Chromebook 2 and the Lenovo ThinkPad 11e Chromebook, as PCMag and The Wirecutter have noted in their tests. That should get the job done for most users, but those who want to really go off the grid should shop around. Dell’s Chromebook 13 is said to get nearly 17 hours of battery life, while Acer’s Chromebook 14 reportedly lasts for more than 11 hours. Final word The HP Chromebook 13 is high-performing yet simple laptop that makes very few compromises. Those who already know they want a Chromebook and aren’t necessarily looking for the cheapest option certainly won’t be disappointed. At about half the price of Google’s Pixel, it’s the first affordable, truly premium Chromebook. That said, it’s worth taking a long look at your other options before pulling the trigger. Cheaper Chromebooks, while they may not be as attractive or comfortable to type on as HP’s latest, still offer a solid experience for hundreds of dollars less. The $300 Toshiba Chromebook 2 and $249 Asus Chromebook Flip, while they have have less memory and storage, are two strong examples. A Chromebook can be great option for those who want a very basic computer that requires no maintenance, making them an ideal choice for classrooms, kids, and grandparents. But if you’re going to commit $500 to $800 for a new computer, it’s worth thinking about whether you want that to be a Chromebook or a more traditional PC. 3.5 out of 5 stars Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/money/4132543/google-chromebook-christmas-gift/"], "sentiment_score": 0.12097913952282886, "subjectivity_score": 0.46095283626837025},

The speakers, the thoughts, the frustration and anger — all the same. But what was different at a meeting of the Next Generation Action Network — the lead group that sponsored Thursday’s night Black Lives Matter rally in Dallas — was that five police officers had died and seven were wounded protecting many of the people in the crowd Sunday night at Friendship West Baptist Church in southern Dallas. “I ain’t anti-police,” said Fredrick Douglass Haynes, the pastor at Friendship West. “It’s about a system that needs to be corrected.” While most speakers expressed regret and condolences for the officers who had lost their lives or were wounded, many felt that such violence was inevitable. And while they condemned the alleged shooter Micah Johnson, they also said he was Exhibit A of the problem. “Micah, God rest his soul, no excuse. It’s horrible, but he’s homegrown,” Haynes said. “You reap what you sow when you’re the most violent nation on the earth.” Echoed Dominique Alexander, the head of NGAN: “We should look also at what got him there, and address the issues. What got him there is the failure of our government to serve the veterans,” he said. “They train them to be vicious and then throw them out on our streets.” Johnson, 25, served a tour in Afghanistan before being honorably discharged from the Army. Before an audience of nearly 1,000 mostly African Americans, the group held two discussions. The first looked at policy changes and things everyone can do to make things better. Ideas ranged from joining nonprofits; attending city council meetings — even when there’s nothing on the agenda — to show numbers and interest; to voting for Republican candidates, when it makes sense to become all-powerful swing voters, and to have a voice in places like Texas, where Republicans have control of most of the government. “As long as we vote for the same people all the time, we’re not going to have any power,” said Pastor Juan Price. “Don’t vote for [Donald] Trump,” his fellow panelist state senator Royce West said, to laughter. “Well, not Trump, no,” Price said. “But I’m independent. I listen to the issues, I don’t get caught up in that party stuff.” But their top recommendation: love. All five people on the panel agreed that the first step to change was “love: that’s what missing in our community. We don’t know how to love each other,” Price said. The second panel talked about grassroots organizing and included Mark Hughes, the man Dallas police falsely accused as a “suspect” and later cleared, as well as Adrian Taylor, whose 19-year-old son Christian was shot and killed by a Dallas police officer last year. The panel also included representatives from the Nation of Islam, a mental-health group and a Latino group to talk about common areas of interest and bringing many groups together to address problems of criminal-justice reform. But after two hours of sedate panels, a long line formed full of angry people yelling to be heard. They demanded to know what answers panelists had to stop police brutality, racial profiling and economic disparity. As each fuming questioner refused to be silenced by the moderator, the audience roared its approval. “We had a community meeting, but we didn’t hear anything from the community,” said La’Shadion Anthony, Dallas Action Coalition. “We were told we can’t effect change in 24-hours. If we stand up all together we can get change … We had a panel about policies but we didn’t discuss any policies.” “Amen! Amen” the audience called.

There might be one lurking in your bathroom shower, or hiding behind your trashcan outside, or across the street shuffling across the neighbor’s porch, or up the road in a grocery store tap-dancing on a pile of papayas. You’ll eventually find Pokestops or Pokegym superimposed on real-world landmarks, join teams of other players and do battle with other squads to maintain control of some precious slice of virtual real estate. Behold, Pokémon Go is now a thing. Which, when you consider Pokémon was already the third-biggest franchise in video games history (after Tetris and Nintendo’s own Mario games), maybe isn’t so surprising. As they say, ya gotta catch ’em all, even where–and let’s just call these examples curious outliers for now–that’s meant invading police stations, stumbling on real dead bodies, training at the Westboro Baptist Church and being ambushed by armed robbers. It sounds crazy because that is crazy, though it stands to reason the majority are having the opposite experience: playing studio Niantic’s game perfectly safe and sound. The Tinder/Twitter figures describing all these players come from data aggregator SimilarWeb, which adds that the game managed to colonize over 5% of Android devices in the U.S. just 48 hours after release. More than 60% of those who’ve downloaded it use it daily (about 3% of all U.S. Android users), says SimilarWeb, and it’s that figure (“Daily Active Users”) SimilarWeb sees as rising to eclipse Twitter’s engagement figures. Big doesn’t necessarily mean well-crafted — I have mixed feelings about the way Pokémon Go actually plays. But you’ll brook no argument from me that it’s a phenomenon (how long-lived, or how much nuttier the stories are going to get…well, stay tuned). And it’s had me dashing everywhere with my almost-four-year-old son, from grassy knolls around my neighborhood, to cornfields over six feet high, to a stick-cluttered beach along the Mississippi river. If you’ve been wondering when the next augmented/virtual reality shoe would drop, pay attention, because we may be witnessing a Tunguska scale event.

This week Netflix placed a message on the buffer screen of its app blaming Verizon and its FiOS Internet service for slow streaming speeds. Verizon took offense and issued a cease-and-desist letter demanding that Netflix remove the message. Now Netflix has just a few days to prove that it was appropriate to blame the ISP, or Verizon may take legal action. This recent bickering is just the latest step in a winding saga that also involves Comcast, Google and the future of the Internet. Here’s a quick Q&A to get you up to speed on the story behind the Netflix-Verizon feud. OK, so why exactly is Verizon mad at Netflix? Netflix has been testing a new version of the buffering screen on its app that gives customers more specific information about why a video is loading slowly. On Tuesday a Vox Media employee spotted the new screen, which placed the blame for sluggish streaming squarely on Verizon. “The Verizon network is crowded right now,” a message on the screen reads.     It is extremely unusual for an online video company to blame a specific ISP for service problems, but Netflix says the message is an effort to “keep [its] members informed.” On Wednesday, Verizon dismissed the message as a “PR stunt.” But Thursday the telco giant issued a cease-and-desist letter to Netflix demanding it remove the accusatory language from its app. “There is no basis for Netflix to assert that issues with respect to playback of any particular video session are attributable solely to the Verizon network,” the letter reads. “As Netflix knows, there are many different factors that can affect traffic on the Internet.” Different factors, huh? Like what? As my colleague Sam Gustin has explained, the journey for a video from Netflix’s servers to your living room is pretty complicated. Broadband companies like Verizon and Comcast are responsible for delivering online content across the so-called “last mile” into customers’ homes. But before that happens, Internet data is typically exchanged between consumer-facing ISPs and bandwidth providers that serve as intermediaries between content companies and consumer ISPs. These deals, called peering agreements, have historically been free, but ISPs like Verizon are now demanding money to connect to their network because they are being forced to transfer lots of high-definition video from companies such as Netflix. Stalled negotiations between Verizon and bandwidth provider Cogent earlier this year caused Netflix speeds to fall significantly for Verizon customers. But I thought Verizon and Netflix already made a deal to fix that? They did. In April Netflix signed a paid peering agreement with Verizon to directly connect to its broadband network and bypass intermediaries such as Cogent. Netflix, it seems, is not happy with the improvements (if any) so far, so the company has decided to call Verizon out directly to consumers. Doesn’t Netflix already have beef with some other Internet Service Provider? Yes, Netflix is quickly becoming the Tupac of online video companies, racking up enemies right and left. In February the company signed a paid peering agreement with Comcast, which first thrust the negotiations between ISPs and content companies into the public conversation. Netflix is very unhappy that it has to pay either Verizon or Comcast to connect to their networks. As Netflix sees it, the ISPs are getting paid twice, once from customers who are promised a certain quality of Internet service per month and then again from content providers who must pay to deliver their video to consumers. Hey, yeah! That’s not fair! Down with Verizon and Comcast! Calm down. From the ISPs’ point of view, Netflix is doing a lot of public grandstanding to try to rewrite the rules of interconnection deals that have been around for decades. Netflix was already paying intermediaries like Cogent to deliver its content before streaming speeds slowed earlier this year. Now, the ISPs say, Netflix is trying to get its content delivered for free and force all broadband subscribers pay for the cost of delivering massive amounts of high-definition video instead of just Netflix subscribers. But some ISPs, such as Google Fiber, agree with Netflix and don’t charge companies to establish a connection to their network. But isn’t this a violation of net neutrality, or something like that? Not really. Net neutrality rules concern the “last mile” delivery of content into residential customers’ homes. Netflix’s fight with Verizon and Comcast centers on how content is delivered to consumer-facing ISPs and who pays for it. Netflix believes the core issue—that ISPs have the ability to charge different companies different prices to connect to their networks—means these peering issues are in the spirit of the net neutrality debate. Since the net neutrality rules are currently being rewritten, it’s possible that peering agreements could be incorporated into the new regulations. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has said he will look into Netflix’s paid peering complaints as the new net neutrality governance is drafted. So are Netflix and Verizon going to court? In its cease and desist letter, Verizon said Netflix must tell it the names of every customer who saw the accusatory message, along with proof that Verizon’s network was to blame for slow speeds, within five days. Otherwise Verizon reserves the right to pursue “legal remedies.” Netflix has so far not indicated that it plans to remove the messages blaming Verizon. A Netflix spokesman told TIME that the company is trying to provide transparency to consumers and Verizon is “trying to shut down that discussion.” But neither side actually wants a court battle, since the discovery process might dredge up communications during their negotiation process that they’d rather keep private (just ask Apple and Samsung). They’ll most likely come to a private agreement that satisfies both parties. Screw these companies. When are my movies going to start streaming faster? Both Netflix and Verizon have said that the streaming speeds would increase over the course of months, not days or weeks. “We are working quickly to implement the network architecture and expect improvements to be experienced across the FiOS footprint throughout 2014,” Verizon spokesman Bob Elek said in an e-mail to TIME. We’ll have a better idea of whether the paid peering deal has been effective when Netflix releases its monthly ranking of ISP streaming speeds later this month. But even if the service quality increases and the legal threats end, the rhetorical battle between Netflix and the major ISPs is likely to continue for quite a while. Now go on and marinate on that while you watch the new season of Orange Is the Black. Hopefully, with very little buffering.

Facing a slowdown in iPhone sales and other tribulations, Apple is on track to spend $10 billion on R&D this year, a 30% increase from 2015. That’s quite a leap. If you look at Apple’s recent financial report, you know the Cupertino, Calif. company had phenomenal earnings last quarter. But what spooked Wall Street is that it’s clear that Apple’s iPhone sales trajectory has leveled out. Sales of iPhones during the last quarter were only about 54 million, compared to over 70 million in the same quarter a year before. Investors, who panic if they don’t see growth, have penalized Apple’s stock in a big way for the slowdown. Still, some financial analysts still see Apple as a good bet. Many have have a “buy” recommendation on the firm, even after factoring in lower iPhone sales levels as the new normal. They realize the iPhone will still be a major cash cow, along with the $10 billion-and-growing service segment of Apple’s business, Mac sales, Apple Watch sales and a new iPhone expected later this year. All of these add up to Apple being a solid company, albeit not with the rapid growth of years past. That said, this major increase in R&D spending is significant. It suggests that Apple has more new products in the research labs that likely go beyond its current lineup. Some of these R&D dollars will be used to enhance the iPhone, iPad, Macs, Apple Watch and Apple’s service programs. But given the size of this budget, it appears that Apple may be “pivoting” towards new categories as well. So what could Apple be working on? Here are a few ideas. Apple recently invested $1 billion in Didi, a Chinese ride-sharing company that competes with Uber. This investment is further evidence that Apple has a serious interest in transportation. This particular investment will help Apple gain greater insight into one of Apple’s most important markets, as well as signal to China’s government and its people that Apple believes in that country’s growth. In a way, it will help make Apple a “local” company in the eyes of the Chinese people, going a long way towards helping Apple enhance its relationship with China’s leaders. Given the rumors that Apple is working on some form of a car — or at the very least working on ways to make cars smarter — you can bet that a significant portion of this R&D spending will be in the automotive space. Apple CEO Tim Cook believes that virtual reality (VR) is not a passing fad, signaling that Apple has great interest in this area. I suspect that Apple has multiple VR projects in the works, including one that most likely has the iPhone’s fundamental technology built into a VR headset. This does not preclude Apple doing something like what Samsung and Google already does, in which an Android smartphone powers a VR headset. But I consider this approach as little more than training wheels for VR. The future of VR will be stand-alone headsets with powerful processors, optics and an optimized operating system and user interface that includes voice commands and navigation gestures. Apple may also have projects in artificial reality or “mixed reality.” Apple is highly committed to the iPhone, iPad, Mac lineup and the Apple Watch, as well as its lucrative services businesses. I suspect that at least $4 billion of this R&D budget will be used to bring more innovation to these devices and Apple’s services platforms to keep them competitive. Cook made a comment late last year during an earnings call that Apple is working on various “things” unknown to the outside world. More recently, Cook has said that he is highly excited about the products Apple has in the pipeline, adding that he has no concern about Apple’s future and its ability to continue to innovate and “delight” its customers. Clearly a portion of this R&D will be aimed at these mystery projects. I’m not even going to try and speculate on what these “things” are. But given Apple’s track record of introducing hit products, this area is worth watching to see how Apple’s R&D spending affects Apple’s ability to innovate.

But anyone who continues to stand against it on principle—“My childhood has been defiled! I don’t like its stars! The trailer was bad!”—is an unimaginative schmuck. Because Feig’s Ghostbusters is its own definitive creature, an affable, inventive riff on Ivan Reitman’s proton-packing caper that exists not to score points, but only to make us laugh. For a summer comedy, there’s no nobler purpose. Like their 1984 counterparts, the new Ghostbusters—Kristen Wiig’s no-nonsense yet vaguely daffy physics whiz Erin, Melissa McCarthy’s screwball scientist Abby, Kate McKinnon’s deadpan gearhead Jillian and Leslie Jones’ fervent Manhattan history nut Patty—are all classic New York City eccentrics who need to find their place in world of nonbelievers. (Their dimwitted but hunky receptionist, Chris Hemsworth’s Kevin, helps out too, but mostly he’s just ridiculously enjoyable eye candy, a form of gentle revenge for years of stereotypical sexy secretaries.) When Erin, Abby and Jillian spot their first real ghost—a nutso turn-of-the-century murderess, now a listless, translucent jellyfish of doom—they jump and squeal with delight, a spontaneously girly reaction for which they make no apologies. But later, when the ghostbusting gets tough—after a squadron of nasty ghouls descend upon an unsuspecting Manhattan—they wield their ectoplasm blammers with Rambo-like authority. It’s all presented with a wink—there’s nothing heavy-spirited or assaultive about this Ghostbusters. Feig, who co-wrote the script with Katie Dippold (The Heat), has clearly taken great care with the movie’s tone—it’s as delicately balanced as the wings of a spectral butterfly. He honors the spirit of the original: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts all have cameos, and a gleaming bronze bust of the late Harold Ramis graces the hallowed halls of Columbia University, where part of that Ghostbusters, like this one, takes place. Yet there’s little that’s nostalgic, in the musty sense, about Feig’s reimagined ghostbusting universe: The movie glows with vitality, thanks largely to the performers, who revel in one another’s company, and not in a self-congratulatory, Ocean’s Twelve-style, “We’re awesome movie stars, together” way. Some of their dialogue has a loose, loopy, unscripted vibe, a la Bill Murray’s poker-faced asides in the original. When the heroines take time out from their heavy-duty citizen-saving for an impromptu Patrick Swayze reverie, they’re inviting us right into the crystalline goofiness of the moment. There’s visual glory here, too: The finale takes place in a dazzling Times Square mashup of past and present, a place where contemporary digital news tickers share space with ghost establishments like Regal Shoes, Nathan’s and an RKO National theater showing Bruce Lee’s 1972 Fists of Fury. In one of the most stunning moments, the women face down a phalanx of sinister vintage Macy’s Parade balloons—floating along, they’re a kiddie nightmare come to life, glowing and gorgeous even as they advance with menacing intent. Their macabre beauty stops the movie for a moment. They’ve come from the past to shake their fists at the present—maybe they don’t like remakes either, but that’s their problem. Happy or not, they’re part of the here and now. This is the kind of movie you make when you ain’t afraid of no ghosts.

The Cupertino, Calif.-based firm hasn’t revealed any information about its upcoming products. But a handful of reports have indicated new Mac devices are in the works. The language on Apple’s event invitation (“Hello again”) may also be a reference to the company’s original Mac launch, hinting that a major update to the Mac might be imminent. Here’s a closer look at what Apple will likely announce on Oct. 27. New MacBook Pro If the latest rumors and reports are to be believed, a redesigned MacBook Pro will be the star of Apple’s show. The new laptop will mark the first major overhaul to the MacBook Pro family in more than four years, according to Bloomberg. The most significant change is expected to be a new touchscreen strip that sits just above the keyboard (where the function key row is now.) The tools shown on this touch bar will change depending on the task or application being used, Bloomberg reported. The row might show playback controls when a media-centric application like iTunes is open, while editing commands may appear when using a program like Microsoft Word. Some have speculated that this strip will be called the Magic Toolbar, after blog Trademark Ninja spotted a trademark application to this effect. Update: An image hidden in Apple’s own macOS Sierra update appears to show a MacBook Pro with just such a touch strip. Other new MacBook Pro features reportedly include a fingerprint scanner and the option to include a more powerful graphics chip made by AMD. Bringing Apple’s TouchID fingerprint sensor to the Mac makes sense, considering Apple Pay (which relies on TouchID to verify users’ identity) now works on websites as part of the recently launched macOS Sierra update. The new MacBook Pro is also expected to be thinner, include a wider trackpad, and inherit the USB Type-C port, flatter keyboard, and pressure sensitive trackpad of its 12-inch MacBook cousin. Other Mac Laptop Updates  Apple will likely introduce a new MacBook Air that features a USB Type-C port, bringing it up to date with Apple’s other newer laptops, according to Bloomberg. KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo also believes Apple could debut a 13-inch variant of its regular MacBook during the event. New iMac Apple’s upcoming iMac refresh will reportedly bring the option to choose new graphics chips from AMD, according to Bloomberg. While this report says the iMac could launch before the end of the year, Kuo cautions it may not be ready until 2017. 5K Display Apple recently discontinued its Thunderbolt display — and it now plans to bring a new external monitor with a sharp 5K screen to market, Bloomberg reports. As is the case with the new iMac, the exact timing of the launch is unclear. Bloomberg said the display could come late this year, while Kuo says to expect it in early 2017. It’s also possible that Apple may unveil these products during its event and wait until next year to release them. AirPods Launch Apple debuted its wireless earbuds when it introduced the iPhone in September, but we have yet to hear of an official release date beyond “late October.” The timing for Apple’s event this week would certainly fall in line with that launch window.

That’s the product’s first-ever year-over-year drop. The Cupertino, Calif. company makes about 65% of its revenue from selling iPhones. So any falloff in those sales is a problem. [findthebest id=”dC2WHJWi9V3″ title=”Apple (AAPL) Revenue Breakdown by Product” width=”600″ height=”523″ url=”https://w.graphiq.com/w/dC2WHJWi9V3&#8243; link=”https://www.graphiq.com&#8221; link_text=”Visualization by Graphiq”] There are two clear reasons for declining iPhone sales. First, wireless carriers are killing off their hardware subsidies. That means many people are feeling the full cost of their smartphones for the first time, leading some to keep their devices for longer periods of time without upgrading. Apple is trying to fight this effect with a kind of leasing program, but how successful that effort has been is unclear. (This problem is affecting all smartphone makers, not just Apple.) Second, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus set a high bar for iPhone sales — shoppers simply went nuts for their larger-than-ever form factors. But making iPhones a little bigger is a trick Apple can only pull off once. (The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which feature more minor upgrades, have had trouble matching their predecessors’ success.) Whether Apple’s next iPhone can match the magic of the 6 remains to be seen. 2. Apple’s predictions about its business are weaker than expected. Every quarter, companies like Apple make a public prediction about how their next few months are going to look. Apple’s guess of revenue between $41 billion and $43 billion for the upcoming quarter is way below what Wall Street analysts were expecting. Their consensus estimate was in the $47 billion range, per CNBC. That gap is wide enough to scare away some investors. 3. Growth in China is slowing down big time. China is Apple’s second-largest market and a source of massive potential growth. The company’s revenue there grew 14% in the quarter before this one, and a staggering 99% in the quarter before that. This time around, however, Apple’s growth in China was negative, dropping 26%. Read next: 3 Things Apple Investors Need to Know Now There are multiple potential reasons for this, some of which are outside Apple’s control. A slowing Chinese economy means consumers aren’t as willing or able to pay Apple’s steep costs. A strong dollar makes Apple’s devices more expensive abroad. And Apple is facing pushback from the Chinese government, which recently banned some of the company’s services in the country. So are there reasons to be optimistic about Apple? Absolutely. Let’s remember that the company still pulled in $50.6 billion in revenues for the quarter, which is, well, a lot of money. There’s also 20% growth in the all-important “Services” category, which includes revenue from offerings like movie rentals and data storage. If Apple can continue to grow that side of its business, it could help make up for falling iPhone sales. (Though software doesn’t provide the huge margins that Apple’s hardware business does.) Expect company executives to make that case in the coming days.

{"type": "article", "header": "RECAP: ", "author": "Eric Dodds", "update_date/publish_date": "April 6, 2014 10:00 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/50225/game-of-thrones-season-4-episode-1-recap/", "text": "Caution: Spoilers ahead.  “As long as I’m better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn’t matter.” The characters in the Game of Thrones universe live their lives based on fear, so in a sense, it’s fitting that the audience does as well: Fear that a favorite character will be killed; fear that something will prevent George R. R. Martin from finishing the books; fear that, for those who have only experienced the television version (this writer included), the events yet to unfold onscreen will be spoiled for them. The season premiere of the show’s fourth season makes it clear that whatever our fears may be, the ones that our friends in Westeros will face over the next 10 weeks are far, far worse. The episode begins with Ned Stark’s enormous sword, forged from Valyrian steel, being broken down, melted and made into two separate swords by Tywin Lannister, who is still serving as Hand to the King. It’s not hard to sort out the symbolism here. For all the talk throughout the episode about how the war was over — thanks to Stannis Baratheon’s defeat at Blackwater and Robb Stark’s butchering at the Twins — it’s clear that the Seven Kingdoms are as divided as they’ve ever been. That division spells trouble for everyone. Though the Lannisters appear strong and unchallenged with the Starks out of the picture and Jaime returned home only slightly worse for wear, the cracks are readily apparent. Between the hand missing from his right arm and the Hand of the King pressuring him to accept de facto exile as de facto Lord of Casterly Rock, Jaime finds himself in an unfamiliar position (though one with which Tyrion is altogether too well-acquainted): unwanted. And if Jaime thought his nephew would be any more grateful for his return, he quickly discovered he was sorely mistaken. Joffrey spent his few minutes on screen this week mocking Jamie for being captured in battle and losing his hand. (It’s fun to remember that Jaime hasn’t seen Joffrey since Season 1, but if he believed that his “nephew’s” reign as king would have made him any less of a brat, coming home must certainly have been a rude awakening.) Even Cersei, who has been desperate for Jaime return since his capture, seems to want nothing to do with him. “If not now, when? I’ve been back for weeks,” he pleads, but his words do absolutely nothing to shake Cersei’s resolve. “You took too long,” she says, and though it’s clear she’d like Jaime to believe that his inability to escape from Robb Stark has caused the change she keeps mentioning, it’s obvious that Jaime believes it has more to do with the visits she’s been receiving from her doctor. Sure, Tywin gave Jaime a lovely sword, but if we’ve learned anything about the Game of Thrones universe, it’s that it takes more than steel to wield power. Things aren’t much better for Tyrion, who spends most of the episode running interference on newly arrived Dornish prince Oberyn (Pedro Pascal). If there’s one area that Tyrion excels in, it’s neutralizing would-be antagonists with his words, rather than his blade. That gift is lost on Oberyn, however, who has a hatred for the Lannisters that only Arya Stark seems capable of matching. Unlike Arya Stark, Oberyn has the means to seek immediate retribution, plunging a dagger deep into the wrist of an unnamed member of the Lannister clan at Littlefinger’s brothel. Seems rather unlikely that it’ll be the last squabble Oberyn gets in during his time at King’s Landing. Of even greater concern for Tyrion, however, is the fate of Shae, as she continues in her role as most openly disdainful attendant of all time. After spending most of last season abiding Tyrion’s wishes that she keep her distance for fear that Joffrey or Cersei will use her to get to Tyrion, Shae has finally had enough. After watching Tyrion’s pitiable attempts to comfort Sansa — inconsolable since learning of her mother and brother’s deaths — Shae goes to the one place Tyrion has forbidden her to go: his bed. However persuasive, her attempts at seduction are no more heeded by Tyrion than Jaime’s were by Cersei, and Shae leaves in a huff after flinging a few choice words in Tyrion’s direction. On her way out, she’s spotted by an attendant who then reports to Cersei that she had heard something “important,” which doesn’t at all bode well for Tyrion or Shae. Cersei might not be in the best of spirits right now, but it’s likely that only makes her more dangerous, not less. In even more imminent peril are the few remaining members of the Stark clan. Jon Snow manages to avoid execution by being completely honest — a tactic that never served his father particularly well — but certain members of the Night’s Watch council still want his head for killing Halfhand and sleeping with Ygritte. More urgently, Mance Rayder’s roving bands are closing in on Castle Black, and if you thought the Wildlings we had already met were dangerous, Styr’s cannibalistic tribe gives a whole new meaning to the phrase “out for blood.” (It became rather obvious what the Thenns were carrying in those bags only moments after they showed up, but something about seeing a human arm on a spit never fails to be chilling). Only Arya appeared to come out on top, but it’s likely a pyrrhic victory. After leaving the atrocities at the Twins, she and the Hound happen upon a local tavern where a group of Lannister-employed soldiers are preparing to rape the daughter (or wife — it can sometimes be difficult to tell on this show) of the barkeeper. One of the men — who had stolen “Needle” from Arya back in Season 2, and killed her young friend — recognizes the Hound, and their initially cordial conversation takes a turn for the nasty, particularly after the doomed man mentions the Mountain. After a typically gory brawl, Arya herself finishes off the man who had struck up the conversation, sinisterly repeating the words he had once spoken to her back to him, then thrusting Needle into his throat. For other characters, this might qualify as a triumph, but it’s harrowing to watch a child kill so mercilessly. More than any of her kin, Arya is becoming someone who’s capable of surviving in Westeros — but at what cost? This sort of ruthlessness has been typical for Daenerys Targaryen for quite some time now. She’s become a mother of dragons, acquired a vast army and conquered cities, and accomplished none of these things by being fearful. Her subordinates worship her (and occasionally vie for her affections, none more aggressively than Daario Naharis, who looks a little different than when we first met him). But because so much of Daenerys’ power is based on her children, she could face substantial problems if they continue to misbehave. She hasn’t looked as scared as she did when one of her dragons snapped at her since Season 1. Daenerys will likely need her dragons — and her troops — to keep in line more than ever as she marches on a city that offers crucified children as welcoming gifts. By all accounts, the season-opener was setting the table for what promises to be a season filled with violence and intrigue. For now, the fear is only creeping in along the edges. Once it arrives in full, that’s when the real fun is likely to begin. Now for the quick hail of arrows:   The most confusing thing from this episode (if you haven’t kept up with casting news) is that Ed Skrein was replaced by Michiel Huisman as Daario Naharis. It’s unclear whether he’ll have better luck charming Daenerys than did his predecessor. Jaime even tries turning to old traveling companion Brienen for kind words, but she seems far more concerned with getting him to uphold his end of the bargain that he made with the late Catelyn Stark. Even though Jaime jokes that she must be part of his family with talk like that, at least she doesn’t appear to consider him entirely useless. Brienne may want to learn to choose her words more carefully around others, though, as Margaery reminds her while the pair discuss poor, dead Renly. It’s hard to know exactly what to make of Oberyn’s companion, Ellaria Sand (Indira Varma of Rome fame), but it’s clear she calls at least a few of the shots — though even she isn’t able to fully control Oberyn’s Lannister-induced rage.

Apple claims Samsung sold products that violate its patented smartphone and tablet —and owes $2 billion for the transgression. Samsung is claiming Apple violated two of its patents and owes $6 million. Apple and Samsung’s tussles in the highly competitive smartphone/tablet market have led to some bad blood. In a biography of Apple’s co-founder Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, Jobs, who died in 2011, is quoted saying, “I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go to thermonuclear war on this.” In the two companies’ last patent fight, Apple was awarded nearly $1 billion, though Samsung is appealing the verdict. But just a week into the case, emails and memos released as evidence in the lawsuit deep the antagonism between Apple and Samsung really is. They also shed light on how each company reacted to the challenge posed by the other. Here are some of the biggest surprises from emails released last week:   Google is a proxy in the Apple-Samsung feud, as Google created much of the technology that powers Samsung’s smartphones and tablets. If Apple wins, Google could have to make big changes in many of its features. But Apple and Google have been at loggerheads for years. In an email revealed last week that Apple’s former chief executive circulated to top company employees in October 2010, Jobs outlined his plan for a meeting at an annual retreat. One of Jobs’ planned discussion points included Apple’s “Holy War with Google” and “all the ways we (Apple) will compete with them (Google).”    Samsung stepped up its ad game in 2012 and 2013 with commercials targeted at Apple that made the iPhone’s technology appear antiquated and unattractive. After Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of global marketing, saw Samsung’s 2013 pre-Super Bowl commercials, he was dismayed enough to write an email to Apple’s outside ad producer, TBWAMedia Arts Lab, comparing Samsung to “an athlete who can’t miss because they are in the zone,” “while we struggle to nail a compelling brief on iPhone.” “I can’t help but think ‘these guys are feeling it,’” Schiller wrote of Samsung.   Apple’s disgruntlement with Samsung’s ad campaign pushed Apple to reconsider its relationship with its outside ad producer Media Lab. Apple “may need to start a search for a new agency,” Schiller wrote to Apple chief executive Tim Cook in early 2013. He added, “we are not getting what we need from them and haven’t been for a while.” The email is all the more surprising considering Media Arts Lab had long been Apple’s go-to ad campaigner, and had created the famous “1984” Super Bowl ad that introduced the Macintosh personal computer.   As part of Apple’s planned move into TV, Jobs was mulling options for the attack. “Apps, browser, magic wand?” he said in a 2010 email as part of potential strategies to bring Apple into television.   In a Samsung business forecast for 2012, the company made it clear that its top prerogative was its tussle with Apple. “Beating Apple is #1 Priority (everything must be in context of beating Apple).” The forecast anticipated the release of the iPhone 5 and said the “threat from Apple is extremely real and urgent.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/42826/apple-samsung-patents/"], "sentiment_score": 0.13136742424242426, "subjectivity_score": 0.39298863636363646},

In a blog post published Wednesday, Google said that it doesn’t charge companies like Netflix for a direct interconnection to its Fiber Internet network. Such connections are necessary to deliver online content across the so-called “last mile” of the Internet to users’ computers. Netflix has paid other ISPs, such as Comcast and Verizon, to establish a direction interconnection to their networks and boost streaming speeds. “We don’t make money from peering or colocation,” a Google Fiber official wrote in the post. “Since people usually only stream one video at a time, video traffic doesn’t bog down or change the way we manage our network in any meaningful way — so why not help enable it?” Google’s argument is essentially the same as Netflix’s—that Internet service providers have already agreed to provide customers download speeds at a certain rate and should honor those deals without also charging content companies to meet those speeds. Companies like Comcast argue that there are costs associated with delivering the large amount of video data Netflix carries into people’s homes, and Netflix should bear those costs instead of everyone that uses a given ISP. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler has said that the FCC will look into Netflix’s complaints regarding paid peering agreements. Though Google Fiber is an ISP that could theoretically make more money charging companies like Netflix, it’s a minuscule part of Google’s business that is mostly aimed at shaming traditional Internet providers like Comcast into building faster networks (faster Internet means more Google searches, which means more advertisements served). Free peering deals are another opportunity for Google to attempt to set a standard that other ISPs might follow. Larger parts of Google’s business, such as YouTube, would greatly benefit from a future where content companies don’t have to pay ISPs to guarantee their content streams speedily in customers’ homes.

The deal, which establishes a direct connection between the two companies to improve service for users, comes two months after Netflix struck a similar deal with Comcast. “We have reached an interconnect arrangement with Verizon that we hope will improve performance for our joint customers over the coming months,” Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers tells TIME. A Verizon spokesperson confirmed the agreement but declined to provide financial terms of the arrangement. After the Comcast pact with Netflix, both Verizon and AT&T expressed a desire to reach similar deals with the streaming service to improve service for consumers. Netflix’s pact with Verizon was first reported by Walter Piecyk at BTIG Research and quickly followed up by Ars Technica and by GigaOm. It’s important to emphasize that paid-peering, or transit, agreements, which occur at interconnection points around the U.S., are not considered to be a “Net neutrality” issue by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Net neutrality is the idea that Internet users should have equal access to public websites over the “last mile” into their homes. After the Comcast deal, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings complained about having to pay “an arbitrary tax” to the broadband giant in order to improve service for customers and urged federal regulators to include paid-peering agreements in the new Net-neutrality rules currently under development by the FCC. But despite his protests, Hastings has begrudgingly agreed to pay up for better service. Paid-peering agreements were not covered by the FCC’s 2010 Open Internet Order, which was struck down by a federal judge in January. By striking paid-peering-interconnection agreements with Comcast and Verizon, Netflix gains a direct connection to their networks, bypassing bandwidth providers that operate as third-party intermediaries between residential broadband companies and Internet firms.

The dispute, which involves secret negotiations about how Internet traffic is routed, has spilled into public view as the relationship between giant broadband providers like Verizon and online content companies like Netflix continues to deteriorate. Most consumers don’t care how Netflix videos arrive on their computer or TV — they just want the service to work. Behind the scenes, those videos must often pass through several bandwidth companies to get to the user. In order to ensure the reliable flow of traffic on the Internet, broadband companies strike so-called “peering” agreements in which they agree to carry each other’s traffic. The actual transfer of data takes place at a handful of “interconnection” hubs around the globe. These are large facilities — sometimes called “telecom carrier hotels” — where companies like Verizon and AT&T can physically share space with other bandwidth providers and Internet companies to exchange traffic under one roof. One of the most famous is 111 Eighth Ave. in New York City, which was purchased by Google in 2010 for almost $2 billion. (MORE: Comcast Set to Buy Time Warner Cable for $45 Billion) Traditionally, these peering agreements were straightforward deals between bandwidth companies that operated on a principle of symmetry. Telecom companies would agree to exchange delivery services in order to ensure that data like phone calls were routed across the country. These pacts helped ensure that calls from New York to Los Angeles could be completed, even if it took a few networks to actually complete the call. You connect my phone calls, I’ll connect yours. But with the explosion of high-bandwidth services like Netflix, which accounts for a massive amount of Internet traffic, the traditionally amicable peering relationship between bandwidth providers is starting to break down. Consumer broadband companies like Verizon and Time Warner Cable are increasingly demanding payment from intermediaries like Level 3 and Cogent in order to carry high bandwidth traffic in excess of peering agreements from other service providers. This feud is now harming Netflix service for consumers, according to the Wall Street Journal. (Time Warner Cable was spun off from TIME parent Time Warner in 2009.) This is a scenario that open Internet advocates have been warning about for years. It’s no secret that the big telecom and cable companies resent the fact that they are obliged to deliver high bandwidth content like Netflix — which competes against their own video offerings — in addition to less bandwidth-intensive traffic like emails and chats. In 2005, incoming AT&T CEO Ed Whitacre famously remarked that upstarts like Google would like to “use my pipes free, but I ain’t going to let them do that because we have spent this capital and we have to have a return on it.” (MORE: Massive Cable Deal Means Your Bill May Jump) The FCC’s 2010 Open Internet order prohibited broadband companies like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon from blocking or discriminating against rival services on their networks. But last month, a federal court struck down most of the FCC’s order, because the agency had earlier failed to classify broadband as a “telecommunications” service, which would have allowed it to establish “common carrier” regulations prohibiting the broadband giants from discriminating against rival services. In the wake of that ruling, the nation’s largest broadband companies insisted that they remain committed to open Internet principles. But the FCC’s order specifically exempts “existing arrangements for network interconnection, including existing paid peering arrangements.” That means that peering deals aren’t covered by the rules. Now, it appears that the big broadband companies are shifting the battle over net neutrality from the so-called “last mile” consumer connection to private peering deals that weren’t covered by the FCC’s order in the first place. “The dominant broadband companies have been working to favor their own services for years,” says Lauren Weinstein, a tech policy expert who supports net neutrality and is a consultant to Google. “These broadband companies have absolute control of access to subscribers, which gives them enormous leverage in commercial peering agreements to the detriment of all competitors, and consumers are unaware because these agreements are typically not public.” (MORE: Net Neutrality Ruling Paves the Way For Internet Fast Lanes) It’s worth noting that Google anticipated how important peering agreements would become. In 2006, just as Google was finalizing its blockbuster deal to buy YouTube, which now ranks second to Netflix in bandwidth usage, the Silicon Valley tech giant moved into New York City’s 111 Eighth Ave., one of the one of the world’s most important telecom peering points. Google would later buy the building outright for $1.9 billion in 2010’s largest U.S. real estate transaction. One way for the big broadband companies to improve service for Netflix users would be to work with the video service’s caching technology — using what’s known as a content delivery network (CDN) — so that the content is closer to the end user. That way, Netflix could peer directly with the likes of Verizon and Time Warner Cable, without having to go through intermediaries like Level 3 or Cogent. Such a move could improve Netflix performance for subscribers, but Time Warner Cable, the nation’s second largest cable company, has balked. Time Warner Cable had been in talks with Netflix about making the video service available for consumers on the cable giant’s set-top boxes. But those discussions have now broken down, according to Bloomberg, after Comcast’s announcement that it intends to purchase Time Warner Cable in one of the largest media buyouts in history. Consumer advocates and public interest groups warn that the proposed deal, which will take a year to be approved by regulators, could limit consumer choice and raise prices. Comcast has dismissed such fears as “hysteria.” Now that the Open Internet rules have been struck down, the FCC faces a tough choice about whether to reclassify broadband as a “telecommunications” service. The big broadband companies aren’t waiting for an answer. The FCC’s now-defunct Open Internet order paved the way for commercial interconnection agreements, which is why private peering deals are the new front in the war between the broadband giants and Internet content companies. Update: Feb. 19 — 3 p.m. ET. Shortly after this post was published, the FCC announced that it would not seek to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service. The agency plans to move ahead with new open Internet rules using its existing authority.

By Thursday evening, in the aftermath of a horrific shooting at a Black Lives Matter rally in Dallas that left five police officers dead and another seven wounded, you would’ve gotten the photo and name of a gun-toting man suspected of killing cops. The problem is: the man in that image released by the Dallas Police Department Thursday evening was at that moment joking around with cops as he helped safely evacuate panicked rally attendees. The tale of Mark Hughes and his brother Corey is a story of everything that is wrong with race relations and policing in America today, except that this tale has a marginally happier ending in that no one actually died. Hughes says he’s lucky to have left police custody alive, though without his rifle or the shirt off his back. But, he notes wearily—by Friday afternoon he still hadn’t slept—he must now live fearing for his life and the safety of his family; both Hughes brothers have received “hundreds” of death threats, presumably from people who believed or still believe that he is a cop killer. “Mark Hughes of yesterday is not the same Mark Hughes of today,” he tells TIME, sitting in his lawyer’s offices a couple of blocks from the crime scene. “When I was walking out of the police station, I saw on big screen TV—on CNN, I think—I saw my face on there. I couldn’t believe it. I was angry for the simple fact that I hadn’t done anything wrong. I was just down there to clear my name.” Thursday had started with anger, and a sense of incredulity—but the kind held at a distance, on behalf of someone else. Mark, 34, and Corey, 39, had been talking about the four killings of black men by police officers across the country in as many days. They wanted to do something about it. Corey had been asked to be on the board of the Next Generation Action Network. The group is unaffiliated with Black Lives Matter but it has some of the same threads: it’s a loose collection of minority voices, often unheard by authorities, seeking justice and recognition. NGAN had planned an impromptu march in downtown Dallas to show solidarity with those killed and Corey was asked to speak. Mark decided to accompany his brother and to make a point, he decided to come with his rifle. In June, Donald Trump had held a rally in Dallas and several Caucasian men had come openly carrying rifles—in Texas anyone who has legally purchased a rifle can openly carry it. Mark thought he’d make the same point with his AR-15. So, wearing a camouflage shirt and toting his gun, Mark went to listen to Corey speak about how the lives of black men were being reduced to hashtags and Internet memes. The brothers were about a block away when the shooting began. They ran for cover and then Corey advised Mark to hand over his weapon to the police lest they think he might have been involved. Mark did so and the two helped the police evacuate the area. Little did they know that someone had snapped a photo of Mark earlier that evening and handed it to the police as a potential suspect. The police posted the photo on social media with an appeal: “This is one of our suspects. Please help us find him!” Mark had left to go search for his car by the time he’d realized the police were mounting a massive manhunt for him. His first reaction: fear. He immediately took off his shirt. He skirted a mob of policemen, afraid of how a group might react, and found a couple of solitary cops whom he approached. They cuffed him and sent him to central booking. Meanwhile, Corey’s phone had died but when he’d finally gotten it charged his heart dropped. Mark’s face was plastered everywhere. “I thought my brother was going to become a hashtag,” he says. “An enraged police force—hearing chatter [of] multiple shooters, some of their own had fallen—and Mark became the face of their rage. My brother had no idea that he was now a domestic terrorist.” Corey went to the police to explain Mark’s innocence. He eventually found his brother, who police had realized had nothing to do with the attack, arguing with officers about his gun. Corey convinced Mark to leave the weapon. “We know we’ve done nothing wrong, but there are photos of us all over social media,” Corey says. “I didn’t think it would be wise to walk out there with a gun.” So, the pair left the gun—and Mark’s shirt, which the police refused to give back—and walked away. They were never read their Miranda rights, though both were detained. They were interrogated even after both invoked the right to counsel. They walked away to jeers from policemen. And when they asked that the police take down the tweet, or at least correct it, they were declined. Ultimately, the police did send out a tweet saying the “suspect” had been questioned and released and by late Friday, they had taken down Mark’s image, though it remains in a video on the Dallas Police Department’s website. And while a tweet started the whole mess, Mark’s friends used Twitter to help correct the record quickly. Now when you google Mark Hughes, headlines about how he was falsely accused are mostly what come up. But that is cold comfort for the brothers who, with their young children, are essentially in hiding. The death threats are still coming, some of them with google maps of their homes ominously attached. Both men are entrepreneurs whose businesses, they say, are not only suffering but have come to a grinding halt because of this. And still, they haven’t heard a word from the Dallas police. They would like Mark’s gun and shirt back and they would like an apology. When asked if they’d want protection, both shudder: “I couldn’t trust the police again,” Corey says. Dallas police did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.  But all of this hasn’t deterred them: they plan to continue attending rallies. And Mark still plans to bring his gun, when he gets it back. “If we stop going to rallies and we stop bearing arms for fear that thing will happen to us, we’re doing our ancestors an injustice—it means we are giving in to intimidation, threats,” Mark says. “The laws that were passed would not be there for us if we let it go and don’t exercise them.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4397785/dallas-shooting-police-protest-snipers/", "http://time.com/4397911/dallas-police-shooting-victims-sniper", "http://time.com/4398392/obama-police-reform-report-task-force-on-21st-century-policing/", "http://time.com/4396585/philando-castile-police-shooting-diamond-reynolds", "http://time.com/4394664/alton-sterling-family-baton-rouge-police-shooting"], "sentiment_score": -0.030408617204391857, "subjectivity_score": 0.41613269359748223},

But on Friday, the mass of police cars swarming this quiet subdivision wasn’t there for an extraterrestrial; they were searching the home Johnson, 25, shared with his mother Delphene for evidence relating to the attack Johnson allegedly pulled off singlehandedly: killing five cops and wounding seven more at a Black Lives Matter rally one day earlier in Dallas. The Johnson home, where neighbors said the family lived for at least five years, is at the edge of civilization—a mile or two down the road and you hit cows and farmland. Driving into Mesquite from the city, cookie-cutter McMansions give way to industrial area by the railroad tracks—home to Marazzi, an Italian tile manufacturer, and the Vince Hagan Concrete factory—and then on the other side of the tracks, the homes shrink, though they still have good-sized yards.  Sitting outside the Johnson home on Friday were a passel of kids with bikes, staring at the police and reporters. Curious neighbors walked their dogs, only to get mobbed by the press. Dee Smith, 47, and her daughter Kendra Smith, 26, were both shocked. Kendra knew Micah at Horn High School. He was, she recalled, a sober, serious young man in the ROTC. But “a normal, good kid,” she says. Johnson served in the Army Reserve from March 2009 until April 2015 where, according to military records, he was a carpentry and masonry specialist. He deployed to Afghanistan between November 2013 and July 2014, which earned him a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, among other awards, before he was honorably discharged. “When he went into the military something happened, I don’t know if something happened there or what,” Dee says of Johnson’s deployment to Afghanistan. Micah could often be seen cutting the grass and tending the lawn. His mother was the friendly one, often stopping to chat with neighbors. According to a Facebook page belonging to a “Delphene Johnson” from Mesquite, Texas, where friends had begun to post condolences, she works at Citibank and before that at God’s Tabernacle of Deliverance, 30 miles away in DeSoto, Texas. The description neighbors provided of Johnson contrasted strongly with Dallas authorities’ account of his final hours. Police say that after he shot a dozen officers, Johnson continued to threaten the police who had cornered him, offering some rationale for his rampage before he was killed by a police bomb robot. “The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” Dallas Police Chief David Brown said during a press conference Friday morning. “He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.” Federal authorities said Friday evening that it appeared Johnson had acted alone. “They were quiet, normal, God-fearing people,” says Angela Harris, 49, another neighbor. “When the police came her at 2:30 in the morning, I had no idea it could’ve been related to the shooting downtown. I thought it must be something else. But something bad. Because nothing ever happens around here. Maybe someone plays their music too loud and people complain. But that’s it.” “This is a nice place,” Harris added, before trailing off. “I don’t know why he would’ve been so angry…” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4398101/dallas-police-shooting-suspects", "http://time.com/4397785/dallas-shooting-police-protest-snipers/", "http://time.com/4397906/president-barack-obama-sniper-dallas-shootings"], "sentiment_score": -0.00519463340891912, "subjectivity_score": 0.42891912320483755},

Two civilians were also wounded in the Dallas shooting. The gunman—who officials say acted alone—opened fire on officers from an “elevated position.” He was later killed by a police explosive after a standoff with law enforcement officers. The shooting now ranks as the deadliest targeted attack on U.S. police officers in nearly 100 years and the deadliest day for law enforcement since the 9/11 terror attacks, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Details have emerged throughout the day, as the investigation developed. Here’s what’s important to know: The incident began with an “ambush” on officers The first shots rang out around 8:45 p.m. on Thursday near a street in downtown Dallas where protesters were marching and police were engaged in crowd-and-traffic control. A total of 12 officers were injured in the ensuing gunfight. At a press conference on Friday morning, Dallas Police Chief David Brown described the incident as an “ambush” on officers. Carlos Harris, a local resident who witnessed the incident, told the Dallas Morning News that the attack seemed “strategic.” “It was tap tap pause. Tap tap pause,” he said. As the investigation continues, parts of the downtown area will remain closed to the public until Wednesday, police said. The gunman was killed by a police explosive The suspect, who died after a standoff with police at a downtown parking garage, told negotiators he was upset about the recent police shootings as well as the Black Lives Matter movement. He also told negotiators that “the end is coming” and that he planned to “hurt and kill” more members of law enforcement. Officials identified the suspect as 25-year-old Micah Johnson, an Army veteran. He had completed a tour in Afghanistan, serving in the Army from March 2009 to April 2015, according to the AP. “The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” Brown said during a morning press conference. “He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.” Johnson, who was killed by a police bomb robot, told police he was not affiliated with any groups. While Brown initially said three suspects had been arrested, officials at a press conference on Friday evening said it now appears Johnson acted alone. “As we’ve started to unravel this fishing knot, we realized that the shooting came from one building at different levels from this suspect,” Rawlings said. Officials said the explosive became their only option after negotiations broke down. “We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was,” Brown said. “Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger.” These are the five victims  Officials identified the victims as Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) officer Brent Thompson and Dallas Police Department officers Patrick Zamarripa, Michael Krol, Lorne Ahrens and Michael Smith. Friends and families are mourning the victims—a group that included veterans, a newlywed and several fathers. Laura Zamarripa, Patrick’s older sister, remembered her brother in an interview with TIME as a caring force in her life and a good father. “He just had a constant smile on his face after he became a father,” she said. Read more about the victims here. The shooting comes amid a heated debate over the role of law enforcement in communities Thursday’s shooting could further polarize a heated national debate about race and law enforcement following the deaths of Philando Castile in St. Paul, Minn., and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La. — both black men who were shot by police officers within a day of each other. The protest in Dallas was one of multiple demonstrations that took place across the country against the two police shootings, with hundreds of people taking to the streets in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and other cities. Aside from the families of the two victims, activists, celebrities and politicians have spoken out against the deaths of Sterling and Castile. U.S. leaders have condemned the violence In a speech from Warsaw, where he is currently attending the NATO Summit, President Barack Obama called the mass shooting a “vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement” and said there is “no possible justification” for violence against police. At a press conference on Friday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch characterized the incident as an “unfathomable tragedy.” “To all Americans, I ask you, I implore you, do not let this week precipitate a new normal in this country,” she said. “I ask you to turn to each other, not against each other, as we move forward. Let us support one another. Let us help heal one another. I urge you to remember today and every day, we are one nation, we are one people and we stand together.

Or I suppose you’d have to say pre-owner: though I’ve put money down, the revised version of Oculus VR’s $350 virtual reality headset won’t arrive until mid-summer. My more intrepid colleague Jared Newman took the plunge yesterday afternoon, just after Oculus VR revealed it was putting version 2.0 of its Oculus Rift development kit up for pre-order (in tandem with demonstrations at the Game Developer’s Conference transpiring in San Francisco this week). We’re not developers, mind you, just virtual reality enthusiasts, and I think I speak for both of us when I say Oculus’ headset is in our top handful of tech-related things to experience this year. But the image up top isn’t of Oculus’ headset, it’s of Sony’s — unveiled at GDC and codenamed Project Morpheus. Slick as it looks in that shot, Sony says it’s just a prototype without a release timeframe. But as Oculus Rift’s creator Palmer Luckey admits, if a company as powerful as Sony can pair compelling enough experiences with a headset like this, it could be just the shot in the arm the esoteric VR industry needs. Let’s run through what we know about Project Morpheus, as well as what we’ve learned since Sony’s announcement Tuesday night. It sounds impressive on paper. According to Sony Japan honcho Shuhei Yoshida, the visor-style prototype includes a 5-inch LCD capable of delivering 1920 x 1080 pixels (1080p) to each eye (Sony calls it “1920×RGB×1080”). It has a 90 degree field of view; an accelerometer and gyroscopic sensors; USB and HDMI ports; and it works with the PlayStation Camera alongside Sony’s DualShock 4 or PlayStation Move controllers. The headset also features Sony’s new 3D audio tech, capable of generating omnidirectional sound that triggers based on your head’s orientation. “Morpheus” is a Greek thing. Morpheus is the god of dreams in Greek mythology (from the transliterated Greek word morphe, meaning “shape”). If you’ve read Ovid’s Metamorphoses, you know what I’m talking about, and if you’ve read Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman, you also know what I’m talking about. The headset has Sony waxing existential. The phrase “virtual reality” is apparently passé, so Sony’s hyping another word to describe the sense of being somewhere else when wearing its headset: “Presence is like a window into another world that heightens the emotions gamers experience as they play,” writes the company, as if describing a Buddhist mindfulness seminar. It needs the PlayStation Camera (and thus the PlayStation 4) to work at this point. Sony says Project Morpheus is designed to work with its PlayStation Camera, released last fall in tandem with the PlayStation 4: “Inertial sensors built into the head mount unit and PlayStation Camera accurately track head orientation and movement so as the player’s head rotates, the image of the virtual world rotates naturally and intuitively in real-time.” I’ve noticed a few claiming the headset works with Sony’s PlayStation Eye, the older camera designed exclusively for PlayStation 3, but I’ve seen nothing official from Sony on this (many still conflate the PS Eye with the PS Camera, when they’re totally different things). At this point, Sony’s confirmed support for the PS Camera only, and since that peripheral uses a proprietary interface (not USB) to link up with the PS4, that means Project Morpheus is probably going to be PS4-exclusive for the time being. It may be motion control’s missing link. For all the Wii’s success (and initial Kinect and PlayStation Move enthusiasm), motion control hasn’t progressed much in recent years, relegated to gaming gimmicks or supplemental mechanics in traditional games that feel forced. Project Morpheus could change this by giving you exactly the sort of interface you’d need, say swinging a virtual sword around without constraints (or a lightsaber, because hello inevitability). It’s not wireless — yet. At this point, Project Morpheus requires a USB or HDMI tether, but Sony’s said it hopes to make the device wireless before launch. It’s almost as good as the Oculus Rift, but not quite. That’s according to Engadget, anyway, who were fortunate enough to give both headsets a go at GDC. According to Ben Gilbert: It’s not all virtual reality rainbows and dreams, of course. There are still some pretty major issues to overcome in Project Morpheus. Vision blur, for instance, is a much bigger problem on Morpheus than on Crystal Cove/Rift DK2. The screen resolution is also clearly not as high as DK2, making everything a bit muddier, visually speaking. Right now, well ahead of launch … Project Morpheus is both extremely promising and clearly not ready for prime time. But it’s close! It won’t be out in 2014. Sony’s confirmed Project Morpheus won’t ship this year, so short of giving it a spin at future trade shows or press events, we’re talking 2015 at the earliest to see if all the fuss pays off. It won’t cost $1,000. Because of course it won’t: Sony’s said as much, and after all, the new Oculus Rift devkits only run $350. You still have to slap a giant clumsy-looking visor/helmet-thingy on your face. VR headsets are stopgap technology on the road — okay, well down the road — to direct neural interfaces and full-on cerebral manipulation. They’re not new, they’re just getting better at the particular trick they’ve been performing for decades. They’re also arguably as limiting as they are liberating, forcing us to throw general ergonomics out the window in trade for a relatively crude (by movie standards) wraparound experience. Dr. Richard Marks, inventor of Sony’s EyeToy motion control camera, once told me that any interface you had to wear, say a headset or full bodysuit, would have niche appeal because it involves sacrificing one sort of freedom for another. Virtual reality is getting better, but I don’t see it going mainstream until we’ve conquered the “You mean I have to wear this funky-looking thing on my head?” problem.

Google’s service, which will be available through the company’s Waze navigation app, would essentially work as a digital carpooling platform, linking paying ride-seekers with drivers headed in the same direction. The company has been testing the service on a small scale but is now ready to expand it more broadly across San Francisco, the Journal reports. Unlike Uber and its nearest rival, Lyft, Google will not yet take a cut of drivers’ fares. That means it won’t make money anytime soon — but thanks to Google’s lucrative advertising business, that doesn’t necessarily need to happen right away. (Uber, meanwhile, is spending heavily on driver subsidies.) The fares, meanwhile, will be modest, meaning Google’s service might nab would-be Uber passengers, but it isn’t likely to attract professional drivers to switch over. Yet Google’s move is another wrinkle in the increasingly strained relationship between itself and Uber. The firms have ties dating back to 2013, when the search giant’s venture-capital arm invested $258 million in the ride-hailing startup. With that investment also came Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond, who took a seat on Uber’s board of directors. However, Drummond left that position several weeks ago amid mounting competition between the two firms in both ride-hailing and autonomous-driving technology. Earlier this month, Uber announced an ambitious driverless pilot program in Pittsburgh set to begin later this year. Google, meanwhile, is developing self-driving cars of its own. The situation has left the two companies in an awkward place. Google, now part of Alphabet, remains an investor in Uber. And Uber CEO Travis Kalanick offered a polite statement on Drummond’s departure, saying that he looks “forward to continued cooperation and partnership.” Yet the firms are challenging one another to shape the future of transportation and logistics, lucrative fields that hold the promise of great riches for the victors. This particular battle is just getting started. But, not unlike the war between Google and Apple over smartphone software, it’s bound to have some very interesting results.

{"type": "article", "header": "What it’s Like to Use Apple’s New Totally Wireless Earbuds", "author": "Lisa Eadicicco", "update_date/publish_date": "September 13, 2016 6:33 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4488773/apple-airpods-earbuds-hands-on-price-release-date/", "text": "One of the few surprise announcements to come out of Apple’s recent iPhone event was the introduction of its new wireless earbuds, called AirPods. They were unveiled alongside Apple’s new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, both of which lack the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack that’s been an audio standard for decades. The AirPods will go on sale in late October for $159. The AirPods feature Apple’s new W1 wireless chip, which allow them to easily connect to other Apple gadgets. Onboard sensors make it possible for the buds to detect when they’re in your ear and, more usefully, when they’re taken out, which will automatically pause your music. The AirPods also have microphones for taking calls and interacting with Siri, which can be accessed by tapping one of the buds while it’s in your ear. Their case, meanwhile, doubles as a charging pack. Apple seems to have two goals with the new wireless AirPods: Offer a wireless earbud solution that works well with its new sans-headphone-jack iPhones, while also easing the wireless gadget setup process. Apple has done the former exceptionally well. As easy as it is to pair most Bluetooth gadgets, Apple has found a way to make it even simpler: Simply flip open the lid of an AirPod case, and the buds will automatically sync to a nearby iPhone. Once you do this, your iPhone will automatically pull up a small panel that shows the name of your AirPods, their battery level, and how much juice is left in its case. The AirPod case could easily be mistaken for one of Apple’s wall adapters, which is a fitting resemblance considering it charges the pods when they’re not in use. The AirPods are designed to last for five hours on a single charge, while the case is said to provide more than 24 hours of listening. Pausing and resuming music while using the AirPods was just as simple as setting them up. Each time I removed one bud from my ear, Spotify would automatically pause the track I had been listening to, only resuming it when I’d place it back in. That’s a nifty feature when you’re listening to music or a podcast but something or someone around you requires your immediate attention. I can also see the AirPods being useful for accessing Siri more quickly during a crowded commute. While testing Siri with the AirPods, Apple’s virtual assistant understood me clearly even though my phone was tucked away safely in my bag. The AirPods delivered loud and rich audio during my experience. I listened to them during my commute to work on two occasions over the past few days, and the sound remained consistent and never cut out. Some reviewers have cited this as a pain point with other wireless earbuds — The Verge’s review of Earin’s wireless earbuds for example, notes that one bud would occasionally lose its signal. The main drawback I’ve encountered with Apple’s AirPods so far is superficial yet important: their appearance. A white stem hangs down from your ears while wearing them, making them anything but discrete. This elongated portion is where the headphone’s battery, antenna, and microphone are located. The $159 price point, meanwhile, will seem expensive to many, though it’s comparable to similar fully wireless earbuds on the market. And it may come across as particularly irksome that Apple would introduce an expensive accessory to solve a problem it created (the lack of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7). That said, the new iPhone also comes with wired earbuds compatible with the phone as well as an adapter for using any other pair of wired headphones. The AirPod’s launch comes as several startups as well as larger companies like Samsung have debuted wireless intelligent earbuds. Some of these go beyond just providing audio: both Samsung’s Gear IconX earbuds and Bragi’s Dash headphones can track fitness stats and offer music playback controls. Above all else, Apple’s new headphones signal the company’s vision of a wireless future. In Apple’s ideal world, we’d all be listening to music through our wireless AirPods and switching between tracks on our Apple Watches, all while our phones are stowed away in our pockets or backpacks. Wireless technology was a big focus during the company’s Sept. 7 event, and I doubt this will be the last we hear from Apple regarding innovations on that front.

That’s pretty much what Sony’s version looks to be doing, though I’m sure the company’s itching to tell us all the ways in which it’ll be different. Sony’s also stressing that what it’s showing at GDC is a prototype, not final hardware. According to Yoshida, the prototype includes a 1920 x 1080 pixel display, has a 90 degree field of view along with accelerometer and gyroscopic sensors, and works with the PlayStation Camera simultaneous with the DualShock 4 or PS Move controllers. The headset also features Sony’s new 3D audio tech, apparently capable of generating omnidirectional sound that triggers based on your head’s orientation. (I noticed another site amusingly noted the device’s codename isn’t a reference to The Matrix, but rather to the Greek god of dreams — of course Lawrence Fishburne’s character’s name in that film was also a reference to the Greek god of dreams, just by way of Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman.) Yoshida says Project Morpheus has been in the offing for over three years, so props to Sony for managing to keep the lid on this one right up to disclosure. We’ll know more soon — Sony’s demoing the device at GDC, and I’m sure it’ll be a centerpiece of the company’s E3 show this summer.

A number of companies, from Facebook and Samsung to Google and Microsoft, are making significant pushes into the technology, which has been a mainstay of science fiction for decades but has largely failed to materialize as a viable consumer product. The latest piece of kit, the HTC Vive announced this weekend, is the product of a collaboration between the Taiwanese phone giant and Valve, the purveyor of the most important software distribution platform on the PC, Steam. Virtual reality, or VR, has a long tortured history. Until three years ago, the technology was more or less moribund. Then Palmer Luckey (now 22), reignited interest with a series of prototypes for a new device called the Oculus Rift, which improved significantly on the old technology by taking advantage of advances in components for phones. His company, Oculus VR, was acquired by Facebook last year for $2 billion. Most of Oculus’ advances, which are now being adopted or emulated by the likes of Sony and Samsung, are in how images are displayed to users wearing the headset. Long story short, a VR system has to display two sets of images—one for each eye—at very fast rates or the viewer will get nauseous. But the HTC Vive, which the companies say will be available later this year, solves the next most vexing problems: once a viewer is seeing 3D space, how do they maneuver and manipulate the environment around them. Aside from content that is compatible with VR, these are the biggest outstanding questions. Once you’re there, what can you do and how do you do it? Early development kits for the Oculus employ a standard console controller to move around, but that can be disorienting. Sony’s Morpheus prototype for the Playstation4 uses a set of controllers that look like ice cream cones with lightbulbs on top with similar results. And Microsoft’s recently unveiled HoloLens, which projects images onto the real world, uses hand gestures and arm motions. It’s still unclear which approach will win out. HTC says its system will come with a base station that can track a user’s movements in 3D space. The company also hinted at a specific controller, perhaps a set of gloves, to enable users to manipulate virtual objects. Details are still scant, but this could solve the problems of mobility in a simulated 3D environment. If Valve and HTC have indeed managed to do that, virtual reality may finally be ready for prime time.

The geeky looking headset and accompanying electronics will cost $1,500. But Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe made it clear Wednesday at the Code tech conference in Southern California that the big price tag is only for people who are starting from scratch in buying the technology. It is expected to go on sale sometime next year. “We are looking at an all-in price, if you have to go out and actually need to buy a new computer and you’re going to buy the Rift … at most you should be in that $1,500 range,” Iribe said on stage. Oculus is developing a headset, which looks like a big pair of ski goggles, that lets users play games and interact with other content in virtual reality. Oculus’s product — along with virtual reality technology in general — are hailed as the next generation in video games mainly because of the immersive experience it gives users. The idea behind the technology is to help people feel like they’re truly inside the game or content’s world. Gaming publication Polygon has pegged the average computer needed to use Oculus’s gear at around $1,200, which means the headset itself will cost about $300 as expected. Iribe added, however, that he hopes to see the total price of using Oculus drop to $1,000 — still pricey, but an improvement from $1,500. The company first raised $2.4 million via a crowdfunding campaign, before raising another $91 million in venture funding and selling to Facebook for $2 billion in 2014.

But the answer must not be violence. The answer is never violence. Rather, the answer, our answer, all our answer must be action. Calm, peaceful, collaborative and determined action.” Here are her complete remarks from the press conference in Washington, D.C.: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for being here today. Last night at least five police officers were shot and killed, several more were injured, along with two civilians, as they sought to protect a peaceful protest in Dallas, Texas. Our thoughts and our prayers and condolences go out to the families of those who have lost loved ones. The Department of Justice, including the FBI, ATF, the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Attorney’s Office on the scene is working closely with our state and local counterparts and we intend to provide any assistance that we can to investigate this attack and also to heal a community that has been severely shaken and deeply scarred by an unfathomable tragedy. This is an unfolding situation. We will be providing additional information when it is available and appropriate. But more so, this has been a week of profound grief and heartbreaking loss. The peaceful protest that was planned in Dallas last night was organized in response to the tragic deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota. Now, we’ve opened a civil rights investigation in Louisiana and we are providing assistance to local authorities in Minnesota who are leading the investigation there. And today, we are feeling the devastating loss of Dallas area Rapid Transit Officer Brent Thompson and four other fallen whose names remain unreleased as we await notification to all of the families.

These feelings are understandable and they are justified. But the answer must not be violence. The answer is never violence. Rather, the answer, our answer, all our answer must be action. Calm, peaceful, collaborative and determined action. We must continue working to build trust between communities and law enforcement. We must continue working to guarantee every person in this country equal justice under the law. And we must take a hard look at the ease with which wrongdoers can get their hands on deadly weapons and the frequency with which they use them. And we must reflect on the kind of country that we want to build and the kind of society that we are choosing to pass on to our children. Above all, we must reject the easy impulses of bitterness and rancor and embrace the difficult work, but the important work, the vital work of finding a path forward together. And above everything, we must remind ourselves that we’re all Americans, and that as Americans, we share not just a common land but a common life. Not just common goals, but a common heart and soul. And those we’ve lost this week have come from different backgrounds, different neighborhoods. But today, they’re mourned by officers, by residents, by family and friends, by men and women and children who loved them, who needed them and who will miss them always. They are mourned by all of us. To the families of all who’ve lost their lives in this series of tragedies, we share your pain and your loss. To our brothers and sisters who wear the badge, I want you to know that I am deeply grateful for the difficult and dangerous work you do every day to keep our streets safe and our nation secure. Our hearts are broken by this loss. The Department of Justice will do all we can to support you in the days ahead. To those who seek to improve our country through peaceful protest and protective speech, I want you to know that your voice is important. Do not be discouraged by those that would use your lawful actions as a cover for their heinous violence. We will continue to safeguard your constitutional rights and to work with you in the difficult mission of building a better nation and a brighter future. To all Americans, I ask you, I implore you, do not let this week precipitate a new normal in this country. I ask you to turn to each other, not against each other, as we move forward. Let us support one another. Let us help heal one another. I urge you to remember today and every day, we are one nation, we are one people and we stand together. May God bless the families and the loved ones of all who were taken from us this week and comfort their grief with his everlasting grace. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

President Obama addressed the nation to urge, “We are better than this.” As he spoke late Thursday evening, thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters were marching through the streets of New York City demanding change and accountability, following demonstrations earlier in the day across the country. Others donated to funds that quickly sprang up for the two men’s families, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars. The week’s bloodshed began when Alton Sterling, 37, was shot dead by police early Tuesday in Baton Rouge, La. Video of the incident captured by a bystander shows Sterling being shot as two officers pinned him to the ground outside a convenience store. One day later, on Wednesday evening, Philando Castile, 32, was pulled over while driving in Falcon Heights, Minn. Castile’s girlfriend Diamond Reynolds, who was in the car, said that he was shot after telling police that he had a gun he was licensed to carry. Reynolds streamed the aftermath of the shooting via Facebook Live, showing Castile in a blood-soaked shirt and a police officer pointing a gun through the window. These two deaths, and the videos that accompanied them, prompted reactions across America. Here’s how nation responded: President Obama “All of us as Americans should be troubled by the shootings,” President Obama said in an address from Poland, where he is traveling. “When incidents like this occur, there’s a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if because of the color of their skin they are not being treated the same,” the President continued, arguing that black and Latino Americans are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system, based on law enforcement data. “That hurts and that should trouble all of us.” Obama called for the country to come together to resolve the issues raised by the shootings. “This is not just a black issue,” the President added. “This is not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about. It’s incumbent on all of us to say we can do better than this. We are better than this.” Relatives and Friends  Family members of Sterling spoke out Wednesday, calling for justice in his death. “I, for one, will not rest or not allow him to be swept in the dirt,” said Quinyetta McMillon, the mother of Sterling’s 15-year-old son Cameron, who was in tears during the emotional news conference. On Thursday, Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, wept as she told reporters police had killed a man she described as her “lifeblood.” Reynolds said that her daughter—who was in the car when Castile was shot—would be “forever scarred.” Those close to Castile remembered him as a role model for the hundreds of children he served while working as a cafeteria supervisor at J.J. Hill Montessori Magnet School in Saint Paul, Minn. “He remembered their names. He remembered who couldn’t have milk. He knew what they could have to eat and what they couldn’t,” said Joan Edman, a recently retired paraprofessional at the school, in an interview with TIME. “This was a real guy. He made a real contribution. Activists Protests erupted across the country following news of Sterling and Castile’s deaths. Demonstrations took place in the Louisiana capital in the days following Sterling’s shooting, and thousands of protesters gathered Thursday in New York City’s Union Square, resulting in several arrests. In Minnesota, many mourned Castile outside of the school where he worked, while others demonstrated outside of the governor’s residence. Wow, governor Dayton comes out to meet sea of protestors #PhilandoCastile pic.twitter.com/xHgBQuLKYX Politicians Many elected officials called for action in response to the shootings. Sen. Al Franken and Rep. Keith Ellison—both progressive leaders from Minnesota—released statements on the the shooting of Castile, calling for a Justice Department investigation. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton also called for an investigation into the shooting in a speech Thursday, adding that he didn’t think the shooting would “have happened if those passengers…were white.” The earlier shooting in Louisiana also prompted outcry from political leaders, including Hillary Clinton, who called the death a “tragedy,” and Bernie Sanders, who said the shootings were “an all too common occurrence for people of color.” America woke up to yet another tragedy of a life cut down too soon. Black Lives Matter. #PhilandoCastile -H The violence that killed Alton Sterling and Philando Castile has become an all too common occurrence for people of color and IT. MUST. STOP. Celebrities Many celebrities offered their condolences on social media—along with their frustration and desire for change. Rapper Drake wrote on Instagram that the video of police shooting Sterling left him feeling “truly scared,” while television producer Shonda Rhimes posted on Twitter that she was “too sad” to write a “furious” tweet about the shootings Beyoncé penned an open letter on her website, calling for fans to take action by contacting their local representatives and demanding justice. “These robberies of lives make us feel helpless and hopeless but we have to believe that we are fighting for the rights of the next generation, for the next young men and women who believe in good,” the singer wrote. Actor Jesse Williams, who delivered a powerful speech last month on racism at the BET Awards, spoke out again this week, asking on Twitter, “would ye noble patriots please provide a list of infractions punishable by spontaneous public execution? Thanks!” Issa Rae, star of Awkward Black Girl, started a scholarship fund for the five children Alton Sterling left behind. The GoFundMe campaign has raised nearly $500,000 in donations.

The protesters started in Union Square at 5 p.m. and then marched up to Times Square, where some of them were handcuffed after sitting in the street and blocking traffic. Demonstrators chanted, “Black lives matter” and “No justice, no peace,” as they continued north toward Central Park. Brittany Irving, a 30-year-old public defender with the Legal Aid Society in New York City, brought her 4-year-old son, Elias, to the demonstration. She compared him in age to the daughter of Diamond Reynolds, who streamed the aftermath of Castile’s death on Facebook Live while her daughter was in the backseat. It was Elias’ second protest, she said; his first was a protest following the death of Eric Garner in a confrontation with police in New York in 2014. Elias wore a shirt that read, “Stop killing us” in red letters. “I hope he feels supported; I hope he feels that all lives will matter in his lifetime,” Irving said. “Because it didn’t happen in my lifetime, or my parents’ lifetime. My sweet little boy will be seen as a threat.” Cynthia Turnquest, 47, of Westchester, N.Y., began protesting the deaths of black men at the hands of police after one of her former students at the Young Scholars Academy of the Bronx, Ramarley Graham, was killed by a police officer. “My father is black, my sons are black, my friends are black and I am black,” she said during the march. “It was never a plan for blacks to be here in America. The plan was for us to be slaves; it was never a plan for us to live the American Dream.” Many local community organizers and leaders of activist organizations joined Thursday night’s march.

Supporters of Alton Sterling, who was killed early Tuesday while police apparently pinned him down outside a convenience store, called for the police chief to be fired or resign and urged residents to boycott the local mall after the fatal shooting. “I, for one, will not rest or not allow him to be swept in the dirt,” said Quinyetta McMillon, 31, the mother of Sterling’s 15-year-old son. The teenager, Cameron Sterling, sobbed loudly and was overcome with emotion as his mother spoke at a news conference. Sterling’s death, which sparked protests in Baton Rouge, was caught in a graphic video, which was widely shared on social media. The footage appears to show two officers approaching Sterling outside of a convenience store. One officer appears to tackle him over the hood of the car, then both pounce on him, apparently to restrain him on the pavement. “As this video has been shared across the world, you will see with your own eyes how he was handled unjustly and killed without regard for the lives that he helped raise,” McMillon, who is not married to Sterling, told reporters. “As a mother, I have now been forced to raise a son who is going to remember what happened to his father that I can’t take away from him,” she added. “He is at an age of understanding. I hurt more for him and his loss.” McMillon wept as she said the greatest failure as a parent is “to see your child hurt and know there’s nothing you can do about it.” Michael McClanahan, head of the NAACP in Baton Rouge, called for Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. to be fired. “He must step down. We cannot have anybody who allows this type of action to take place,” he said. Dabadie said at a news conference that he would not resign and said those who are asking for him to step down from his post were “acting off emotion.” “I’m not retiring. I’m not resigning,” he added later. “I don’t think it’s fair for people to act out of emotion. We have done a lot of good in this community. We’re working diligently to bring the truth out.” Abdul Rashid Muhammad, who leads the local chapter of the Nation of Islam, urged supporters to boycott the Louisiana mall, starting Friday “until we get justice.” “Let’s withhold our money,” he said. “Don’t spend anything.” Sandra Sterling, the aunt of the slain man who raised him, said she was grateful for the unknown bystander who recorded the video but that she was “very disturbed” and “hurt” at what she saw in the footage. “It’s a horrible thing to happen to him,” she told reporters Wednesday. “He didn’t deserve that.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4394411/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-shooting/", "http://time.com/4395056/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-police-chief/"], "sentiment_score": 0.029493464052287567, "subjectivity_score": 0.32957516339869275},

Some of the details remain unclear, but here’s what to know about Philando Castile’s death so far: What happened? Police pulled over Philando Castile, 32, for driving with what his girlfriend Diamond Reynolds described as a “busted tail light.” Reynolds said the officer asked to see Castile’s license and registration after the traffic stop, prompting Castile to reach for the documents. Castile told police he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to Reynolds. At some point, the police officer opened fire. Reynolds began streaming the incident to Facebook Live shortly after the shooting. In the video, Castile is seen with a bloody shirt and the police officer’s gun is seen through the window. Reynolds’ daughter is in the back seat of the car. Castile was pronounced dead less than an hour later at a nearby hospital. Who was Castile? Castile was a cafeteria supervisor at a Montessori school where he had worked for more than a decade, according to a Minneapolis Star Tribune report. He grew up in St. Paul and also lived in Minneapolis. A cousin told the Star Tribune that Castile had been a straight-A student who graduated with honors from St. Paul Central High School. “They killed my son,” Valerie Castile, Philando’s mother, said after learning of his death, according to the Star Tribune. “They took a good man, a hard-working man; he worked since he was 18 years old.” Who are the officers? The officer who fired has not been identified. Police officials said he has been placed on paid administrative leave. What happens next? The interim chief of the St. Anthony Police Department said the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is leading an investigation into the death. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said Thursday that he has asked the U.S. Department of Justice to launch an independent investigation. In the meantime, protesters have gathered in the state capital.

A sniper shot officers on duty at a peaceful protest following the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile by Louisiana and Minnesota police officers earlier this week. The suspect was shot and killed after a standoff with police. The victims include Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) officer Brent Thompson and Dallas Police Department officers Patrick Zamarripa, Michael Krol, Lorne Ahrens and Michael Smith. Brent Thompson, 43, joined DART Police Department in 2009. He is the first to be killed in the line of duty since the agency was established in 1989. He had just married a fellow officer. Before DART he worked for military contractor DynCorp International, mentoring and training teams in Afghanistan and Iraq. He also described himself on Linkedin as someone motivated by a “team” atmosphere, writing: “I enjoy working on challenging tasks and problem solving with my peers. I am constantly looking for different ways to serve the department, this helps to keep my work from becoming sedentary and boring.” Dallas Police Officer Patrick Zamarripa, 32, was a Navy veteran who had imagined being a police officer since childhood, his sister said. He was thrilled with the birth of his daughter two years ago. “He just had a constant smile on his face after he became a father,” his sister Laura Zamarripa said. His Twitter photo shows him holding a small child, and on Father’s Day he tweeted: She let me take nap. Best. #FathersDay Gift. Ever! Dallas Police officer Michael Krol, an eight-year veteran of the department, had a lifelong dream of being a police officer, according to local media reports citing a family member. He had previously served as a Wayne County sheriff’s deputy and worked in county jails from 2003 to 2007, Sheriff Benny Napoleon said Friday. Dallas Police officer Lorne Ahrens was a former semi-pro football player who stood tall at 6′ 5″. He is survived by his wife, two children and a step-child, according to a Washington Post report. Dallas Police Sgt. Michael Smith, 55, was a former Army Ranger and the father of two young children, according to a USA Today report. DART released the names of the other three of its officers injured in the shootings: Omar Cannon, 44, Misty McBride, 32, and Jesus Retana, 39 “As you can imagine, our hearts are broken,” the agency said in a statement. “This is something that touches every part of our organization. We have received countless expressions of support and sympathy from around the world through the evening. We are grateful for every message. Thank you.” “We are grateful to report the three other Dart police officers shot during the protest are expected to recover from their injuries. No other Dart employees working in Downtown during the protest or shooting were injured. We also extend our sympathies to our colleagues at the Dallas Police Department in the loss of their five officers.” Write to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4398101/dallas-police-shooting-suspects/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4395459/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-police-shooting/", "http://time.com/4396220/philando-castile-minnesota-shooting/"], "sentiment_score": 0.033217592592592576, "subjectivity_score": 0.32199074074074074},

But dreams of Disney were cut short Thursday night, when Zamarripa and four other cops were shot and killed by a sniper targeting officers at a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest. Instead of making plans for the future, Zamarripa’s family is now mourning the 32-year-old Navy veteran, who had always dreamed of becoming a police officer so he could help keep people safe. His protectiveness even extended to his older sister Laura Zamarripa, 34, who remembers him having her back even when they were kids. “He was my bug killer,” she recalled Friday as the family gathered to grieve together in Texas. “Even thought I was the big sister and I was strong and stuff, I could never kill bugs. He would get up in the middle of the night.” “He took care of me,” she added. Later, Zamarripa served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and even as he was facing dangerous situations in the military, he always checked up on his sister, who was also enlisted. “I was on a ship, and my brother was stationed on an oil rig, and I would get letters from him weeks later delivered via helicopter,” she remembered. “He was keeping up with the status of my ship and asking questions, even though he was my little brother.” Two years ago, Officer Zamarripa’s entire world changed with the birth of his daughter, Lyncoln. She made him a “happy spirit,” Laura said. “He just had a constant smile on his face after he became a father.” He was a “super proactive” dad who took his baby daughter to the gym with him and was an expert diaper changer, she added. “I think he finally found someone to play with,” Laura added of the birth of her niece. “He filled some part of his heart that was obviously empty.” The world Zamarripa had hoped to build for his daughter was “nothing like last night,” Laura said the morning after the shooting. The only part of his job he disliked was witnessing violence against children. “He would say ‘this is the only thing I don’t like about my job, is that I have to see children who are helpless get mistreated,'” she said. At the end of each year Zamarripa and his two siblings always discussed their wish for the year ahead, Laura recalled: “We have this thing between the three of us, and we’d say ‘what do you want for Christmas?'” she said. “And we’d always say ‘world peace and happiness.” Write to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4397785/dallas-shooting-police-protest-snipers/", "http://time.com/4397906/president-barack-obama-sniper-dallas-shootings/", "http://time.com/4398101/dallas-police-shooting-suspects"], "sentiment_score": 0.08042929292929293, "subjectivity_score": 0.4184343434343434},
{"type": "article", "header": "When Can Police Use a ‘Bomb Robot’ to Kill a Suspect?", "author": "Haley Sweetland Edwards", "update_date/publish_date": "July 8, 2016 1:48 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4398196/dallas-shooting-bomb-robot/", "text": "Late Thursday night, Dallas police attached an explosive device to what’s known as a “bomb-disposal robot,” rolled it into an area where one of the suspected shooters was holed up, and detonated the bomb, killing him on the spot. The move marked the first time that civilian police have used a robot to kill an American suspect on American soil, according to several legal and robotics scholars, raising major questions about the use of such machines in domestic stand-offs. “The situation definitely raises interesting questions,” said Peter Asaro, an assistant professor at the New School for Public Engagement in New York City and a co-founder of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control. “Who was controlling the bomb? Who was controlling the robot?” Not to mention: Was this the best use of force in this case? What does it mean for the use of robots in future instances? At a Friday morning press conference, Dallas Police Chief David Brown said that a hostage negotiator had been in touch by phone with the suspect in question, but it was apparent that the shooter remained dangerous and officers were in danger. Brown also said the suspect mentioned the placement of IEDs, improvised explosive devices, in the city. “We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was,” Brown said. “Other options would have exposed our officers to great danger. The suspect is deceased as a result of detonating the bomb.” Several legal and robotics scholars told TIME that, given those circumstances, the use of the robot in this case was no different, from a legal or moral position, than killing an active shooter in another way. “From a utilitarian perspective, if the officers on the scene have already decided that they need to kill this person, how they do it doesn’t matter,” Ansaro said. Dan Montgomery, a former police chief and expert on police practice, agreed that the officers acted according to agreed-upon rules of engagement. “Admittedly, I’ve never heard of that tactic being used before in civilian law enforcement, but it makes sense,” he told TIME. “You’ve got to look at the facts, the totality of the circumstances. You’ve got officers killed, civilians in jeopardy, and an active shooter scenarios. You know that you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do to neutralize that threat. So whether you do it with a sniper getting a shot through the window or a robot carrying an explosive device? It’s legally the same.” Cynthia Lum, director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University, also noted the Dallas police force’s “highly unusual use of a robot,” but said the situation merited it. The use of robots can be an effective way to avoid harm to police officers or bystanders, she said. Other scholars said the situation seemed a little murkier. Keith Abney, a professor of ethics and emerging sciences at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, said that while the police officers’ decision to use the robot to kill the suspect in this case “doesn’t seem fundamentally ethically different from another distance weapon, like a sniper rifle, used to take out suspects in an active shooter situation,” there is still the question of why the suspect had to die. “One can wonder why, if they could send in a teleoperated robot with C4 to kill the suspect,” he told TIME, “why they couldn’t instead equip the robot with knockout gas or some other nonlethal agent to capture the suspect, instead of killing him.” Gloria Browne-Marshall, an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the incident was most concerning because of what it means for future cases: What are the parameters surrounding the use of such technology on civilian soil? “If we’re going to start using—as a country—this kind of drone technology and robots on a civilian population, then we’re easing into a civil war,” she told TIME. “We’re easing into one because we have civilians who believe that the government is not protecting them, and we have a government who believes that civilians are armed enough that they have to use military tactics.” Thomas J. Aveni, the executive director of the Police Policy Studies Council, told TIME that the events in Dallas should not be taken lightly. Given the precise circumstances in this case, the police were justified in their decision to use the robot to kill, he said. “But some will say it’s a slippery slope—that this remote way of killing people that we’ve accepted and embraced in the military realm, it is something that should be more closely examined, and I would concur,” he said. “We should codify some ethical guideline on when people can be killed remotely,” he added. “Can we used aerial drones like we use in Afghanistan?” Peter Singer, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tank New America and leading expert on 21st century security issues, said that many domestic police forces now have two types of robots of different sizes and shapes in their arsenal—those used for surveillance and those for bomb disposal. Surveillance robots are equipped, as would be expected, with cameras, he said, while bomb disposal robots generally have a sophisticated arm that can be operated remotely by something akin to a joy stick. Importantly, Singer said, these robots are not designed or intended to be used as weapons to kill. In the past, U.S. police forces most often use bomb disposal robots to inspect suspicious packages, dismantle bombs, and to initiate what’s known as a “controlled explosion” of explosive device. For example, last year, San Jose police convinced a man not to commit suicide after sending a robot to deliver a phone and pizza to him. In other instances, robots have been used to deliver notes to kidnappers or to monitor a suspect’s behavior. In the Dallas case, it’s unclear when officers decided to employ the robot in this innovative way, and what they used to weaponize it. Brown said only that a “device” was placed on the robot’s “extension.” Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said in another statement that the suspect was killed after police used explosives to “blast him out.” Experts told TIME it’s possible that officers used the same small explosive device used during a controlled explosion to explode next to the suspect. It’s also possible that they used a hand grenade or a mine, experts added. Aveni, who has worked as a police officer for 26-years, said that explosive charges are generally used only rarely—to breach a door, serve as a distraction, or to detonate a bomb or suspicious device. “To actually devise something with the express intent to kill somebody is totally new,” he said. Singer says that while that’s unprecedented on American soil, U.S. soldiers have used a robot abroad in that way. The U.S. military employs roughly 12,000 ground surveillance and bomb-disposal robots, which are most often used in Iraq and Afghanistan to inspect buildings or to determine whether a car, stopped at a check point at a safe distance, was carrying explosives, Singer said. In his 2009 book, Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century, Singer recounted a story in which U.S. soldiers in Iraq duct-taped an explosive to a Marcbot, a knee-high ground robot that looks like a child’s toy truck, and sent it down a narrow alleyway, where a combatant had been hiding. The soldiers detonated the bomb, killing the combatant. “That’s not the intended use of a Marcbot,” Singer said. “It wasn’t designed that way, that wasn’t how the soldiers were trained. It was them taking duct tape and coming up with their own solution to the problem.” Based on police reports Friday, that appears to be the same scenario that occurred in Dallas: police officers were using a bomb-disposal in an innovative way. Singer also makes a distinction between the robot that was used to kill the suspect in this case and the specter of “killer robots” that politicians, ethicists, and science fiction aficionados have been concerned about for years. The “killer robot,” at least in theory, is an artificially intelligent being that has been designed specifically to be armed and autonomous, like the Terminator. “That obviously doesn’t seem to be what’s going on in Dallas,” Singer said. But the use of a robot to kill a suspect on American soil still has people feeling a little unnerved. There’s nothing in annals of police code of conduct or U.S. law that specifically address this issue, Aveni said. “This is a new frontier.” Katie Reilly contributed to this report.

Based on two-and-a-half minutes of footage, it appears we can expect chalkboards full of physics equations, slapstick comedy and plenty of ectoplasmic residue from the movie, which hits theaters July 15. As for the decision to cast four women in the leading roles, in contrast to the original film’s four male actors, Feig said at the trailer’s sneak preview Wednesday, according to Deadline, that it’s not worth fussing over. “The first movie worked because it had four of the funniest people,” he said, “and I just want the funniest people, and the funniest people are these women.” Write to Eliza Berman at eliza.berman@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.17752525252525253, "subjectivity_score": 0.3713804713804715},

Here’s what you need to know about Sterling’s death: What happened? Sterling was killed early Tuesday while two officers had him pinned to the ground of a parking lot outside of a convenience store, according to graphic videos of the incident captured by an unknown bystander. The encounter occurred when the officers were dispatched to Sterling’s location outside the store after Baton Rouge Police Department received a disturbance call after midnight. A caller told a dispatcher that a black man in a red shirt who was selling CDs had threatened him with a gun. “An altercation between Sterling and the officers ensued. Sterling was shot during the altercation and died at the scene,” the police department said in a statement. The footage appears to show two officers approaching Sterling outside of a convenience store. One officer appears to tackle him over the hood of the car, and then both pounce on him, apparently to restrain him on the pavement. At one point, a voice can be heard yelling, “He’s got a gun! Gun!” Gunfire erupts moments later. Another video, provided by the Daily Beast, surfaced later Wednesday and shows the shooting from another angle. Why was Sterling shot? It’s unclear what led the officers—identified as Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake—to open fire on Sterling. The owner of the convenience store, Abdul Muflahi, who knew Sterling, told local media outlets that he never saw Sterling reach for a weapon. Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. said Sterling was armed but that there are still questions about what happened, according to the Associated Press. The police chief at a news conference demanded answers and said “no stone will be left unturned” as authorities work to determine what prompted either one or both of the officers to pull the trigger. “Like you, there is a lot that we do not understand,” Dabadie said. “And at this point, like you, I am demanding answers. Like you, all my prayers are with this community and especially the community and loved ones of Mr. Sterling.” Dabadie said the department is seeking to gather information from the officers’ body cameras. The U.S. Justice Department has opened a civil rights probe into Sterling’s fatal shooting. Who was Sterling? Sterling was remembered as a loving father. His 15-year-old son, Cameron Sterling, wept uncontrollably at a news conference his family held on Wednesday until he was removed from the view of cameras as his mother, Quinyetta McMillon, 31, pledged to fight for justice. “As this video has been shared across the world, you will see with your own eyes how he was handled unjustly and killed without regard for the lives that he helped raise,” McMillon told reporters. “As a mother, I have now been forced to raise a son who is going to remember what happened to his father that I can’t take away from him,” she added. “He is at an age of understanding. I hurt more for him and his loss.” Sandra Sterling, the aunt of the slain main who raised him after his mother died, said Sterling “didn’t deserve” what happened to him. Who are the officers? Authorities identified the two police officers involved in Sterling’s shooting as Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake. Salamoni has been with the Baton Rouge Police Department for four years, while Lake has served for three years, authorities said. Both work for the Uniform Patrol Division and have been placed on paid administrative leave. “The officers feel they were completely justified,” District Attorney Hillar C. Moore III told The Advocate, adding that Baton Rouge police interviewed the two officers before the case was turned over to the Justice Department. In 2014, Lake was one of six Baton Rouge police officers who were placed on administrative leave after being involved in a Dec. 13 shooting of a man who attempted to flee police, the Times Picayune reports. Baton Rouge Police Cpl. L’Jean McKneely told the newspaper at the time that the suspect was shooting at the officers while trying to run away from authorities on foot. The suspect survived the shooting with only moderate injuries, according to The Advocate.

Police identified the gunman as 25-year-old Micah Johnson and said he was an Army veteran with no criminal history. He completed a tour in Afghanistan, serving in the Army from March 2009 to April 2015, according to the Associated Press. “Others have identified him as a loner,” police said in a statement. Dallas Police Chief David Brown said Johnson—who told police he was not affiliated with any groups—was killed in a standoff with law enforcement in a parking garage during the early hours of Friday morning. Brown said Johnson told police he was upset with police shootings and wanted to kill white officers. The Dallas shooting began during a protest over police brutality, following the deaths of two black men by police officers in separate incidents this week. “The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” Brown said during a press conference Friday morning. “He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.” Johnson was killed by a police bomb robot after the lengthy standoff. “We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was,” Brown said. “Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger. The suspect is deceased as a result of detonating the bomb.” Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said Johnson had threatened to use bombs. At a press conference on Friday night, Rawlings said officials gave Johnson “plenty of options” for surrender before they used the robotic explosive. “As it concerns the cowardice, it seems as if the sole suspect now has received his justice, and what will be important is to ensure that there are no other potential co-conspirators with this particular assailant,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at the same press conference. While Brown initially said that three suspects, including a woman, had been taken into custody by Dallas police, state and federal officials said on Friday evening that it now appears Johnson acted alone. “As we’ve started to unravel this fishing knot, we realized that the shooting came from one building at different levels from this suspect,” Rawlings said. Police said that during a search of Johnson’s home, detectives found bomb making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition, and a personal journal of combat tactics, which they are still reviewing. In addition to the 12 officers, two civilians were injured in the shooting, which President Barack Obama called a “vicious, calculated and despicable attack.” Write to Tessa Berenson Rogers at tessa.Rogers@time.com and Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4397785/dallas-shooting-police-protest-snipers/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4398698/dallas-shooting-police-chief-david-brown/", "http://time.com/4398034/dallas-shooting-suspect-white-officers/", "http://time.com/4396220/philando-castile-minnesota-shooting/", "http://time.com/4398196/dallas-shooting-bomb-robot/", "http://time.com/4399164/dallas-shooting-mayor-mike-rawlings-prayer-vigil/", "http://time.com/4398685/dallas-shooting-gov-greg-abbott-open-letter/", "http://time.com/4397906/president-barack-obama-sniper-dallas-shootings"], "sentiment_score": -0.047126436781609195, "subjectivity_score": 0.28965517241379307},

While there’s no official database of police shootings in the U.S., there are several independent tallies of fatal force incidents. According to numbers compiled by the Washington Post, 505 people have been shot and killed by the police in 2016, and 122 of them were black. The Guardian has tallied 558 people fatally shot by the police, including 135 black individuals. The number of deadly incidents this year is tracking alongside 2015’s tally. According to the Post, there have been about 25 more fatal shootings this year compared with this time last year, while the Guardian shows similar figures. While dozens of black men have been shot and killed in the U.S. by police this year, few have garnered the kind of attention that Sterling’s shooting is getting, largely because those incidents were not captured on a dramatic video like the one that surfaced following Sterling’s death. Sterling was shot early Tuesday morning by police after he was pinned to the ground outside a convenience store. According to the New York Times, police arrived at the scene after someone reported that a man selling CDs outside the store had threatened them. In a video taken by a bystander, police can be heard yelling “Get on the ground!” before two officers forcibly subdue Sterling. The video cuts away as multiple shots are heard. The incident led to protests in Baton Rouge Tuesday night and the video has since been shared widely on social media with the hashtag #AltonSterling.

A female passenger streamed the aftermath of the incident on Facebook Live showing Philando Castile, 32, bloodied in the driver’s seat and a police officer with his gun still visible through the window. The woman’s daughter sits in the backseat of the car. In the video, the woman, Diamond Reynolds, says the officer asked Castile for his license and registration. Castile reached for the information as requested and also informed the officer that he had a gun in the car and was licensed to carry, the woman says. “I told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hands up,” the officer says in the graphic and expletive-laced video. “Please, officer, don’t tell me that you just did this to him,” the woman says in the video. “You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir.” The video continues as Reynolds and her daughter are detained and transported in the back of a police car. “It’s OK,” the daughter tells her mother. “I’m right here with you.” The shooting occurred around 9 p.m. in Falcon Heights, a St. Paul suburb, and Castile was declared dead at a nearby hospital less than an hour later, according to the Star Tribune.   The video—now viewed more than 2 million times on Facebook—gained immediate traction online over night. Protesters gathered in front of the governor’s residence in Madison shouting “no justice, no peace.” An investigation into the shooting by the St. Anthony Police officer is being led by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.

The incident occurred as outrage continues in Louisiana over a video of a black man being shot repeatedly by police.

But Orta has virtually nothing to do with the protests and social justice organizations that have sprung up since. And today, one year after Garner’s death on July 17, 2014, he occasionally wishes he hadn’t been a part of it all. “Sometimes I regret just not minding my business,” Orta tells TIME. “Because it just put me in a messed-up predicament.” Orta no longer resides in Staten Island. Instead, he lives in a small, narrow apartment with his mother and brother in the New York City area and has asked that more detailed information about the location not be published because of what he claims is a pattern of harassment by police since the Garner video was published. The doorknob on the building’s main entrance is broken. Its halls smell of urine. Inside, Orta sleeps on a mattress on the floor. When he’s not in court fighting a series of drugs and weapons charges, Orta’s usually here, watching TV or on his phone. Sometimes he pays attention to the latest high-profile incident involving police and unarmed black men. Sometimes he tunes them out. It’s likely that no one outside of Staten Island would ever know the name of Eric Garner without Orta’s video, which became the first in a wave of recordings of African-Americans in violent confrontations with white police officers to command national attention. A month later came Ferguson and Michael Brown, then Cleveland and Tamir Rice, Baltimore and Freddie Gray, North Charleston and Walter Scott, McKinney, Texas, and the pool party. At least a dozen incidents, some recorded, some not, have made national headlines since Garner’s death. And the phrase “I can’t breathe,” which Garner can be heard repeating in Orta’s video as police held him down, has been adopted as a primary rallying cry of the movement. But a year later, Orta says he would at the very least rethink his decision to pull out his camera. In two separate interviews with TIME, Orta expressed ambivalence and even outright regret over getting involved. And if he had to do it over again, he says he would release the video anonymously.   Video by Salima Koroma for TIME In the last year, Orta’s life has been upended. He has been arrested three times since August 2014. The first, for criminal possession of a handgun he allegedly tried to give a 17-year-old, came a day after Garner’s death was ruled a homicide by the city’s medical examiner. In February, he was arrested again on multiple charges of selling and possessing drugs. The third came on June 30 when he was accused of selling MDMA to an undercover cop. A lab test later showed that the alleged MDMA was fake and the charges were reduced. All told, Orta is facing more than 60 years in prison if convicted on all charges. Orta, 23, is shy and speaks in a soft almost-mumble. He would be unassuming if not for his steady gaze, which makes you think he’s going to say more, though he rarely does. And he is tiny. Arrest records list him at 5’6” and 115 lbs., but that might be generous. Orta was born in Manhattan and lived there until he was about 10 years old. Around age 12, his parents split up and he soon found himself helping raise his younger brother Jaime. “He grew up fast,” says Emily Mercado, Orta’s mother. “He was like my little husband, telling me what to do, where I’m going.” The family bounced around from New Jersey to Pennsylvania and then back to New York, relocating to Staten Island around the end of 2009. Back in New York, Orta says he worked mostly in delis stocking shelves and making sandwiches. Orta didn’t finish high school but later attended trade schools and studied carpentry. He also had multiple run-ins with the law. Since 2009, Orta has reportedly been arrested dozens of times. In August, an unnamed police source told the Staten Island Advance that Orta had been arrested 26 times, with at least 10 of those cases sealed by the courts. His lawyers say his number of total arrests is far fewer. Orta was convicted for attempted sale of a controlled substance in 2011 and criminal possession of stolen property in 2012. For those, he served six months in jail. According to the Staten Island district attorney’s office, Orta has also been convicted of six misdemeanors. Orta became acquainted with Garner soon after moving to Staten Island. They first met near where Garner died, outside a beauty supply store in the Tompkinsville neighborhood. Orta describes Garner as an amiable guy, often laughing and cracking jokes. The day Garner died, Orta says he and Garner were making plans to get food when police approached. “I was already on my phone,” Orta says. “I always seen them cops doing something to somebody else, so I figured I’d just record it.” Garner was known to the local cops and had reportedly been arrested more than 30 times since 1980. On the video, he can be seen pleading with officers, claiming he wasn’t doing anything wrong and accusing police of unfairly harassing him. Daniel Pantaleo and several other officers tried to detain Garner, who resisted arrest and was wrestled to the ground. Garner became unresponsive and later pronounced dead at a hospital. Two days later, Pantaleo was stripped of his gun and badge and, along with another officer involved, placed on desk duty. In December, a grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo in Garner’s death. On July 13, New York City agreed to a $5.9 million settlement with Eric Garner’s estate for damages related to his death. Orta released the video to the New York Daily News the day after Garner’s death. Since then, Orta says that police have harassed him and his family. In the weeks after Garner’s death, he released two videos on YouTube in which he claims he was unfairly targeted by police. He says he was stopped twice for robberies in which he had no involvement and claims that police shone lights in the windows of his Staten Island home. On Feb. 10, Orta, his mother, and brother, Michael Batista, were arrested on multiple drug charges after police entered their home in the early morning hours. All three were charged with multiple felony and misdemeanor drug counts. Those cases are still pending. Orta’s mother says she’s been in therapy since the incident for what she describes as post-traumatic stress disorder. “I don’t want to be around cops,” Emily Mercado says. “I stay indoors.” Orta’s aunt, Lisa Mercado, who has often spoken on behalf of the family, says she too has been followed by the police and claims that Orta’s possessions were taken from his former Staten Island home after he moved. She says the family filed a police report but the cops never investigated. “Only Ramsey’s stuff was missing,” she says. From February to April, Orta was locked up in Rikers Island, New York City’s largest jail, awaiting bail following his arrest on drug charges. Orta’s lengthy arrest record, however, which includes numerous charges from before the Garner incident, makes it difficult to back up many of his claims about police retaliation. The NYPD did not respond to multiple requests to comment for this story. What is clear is that the attention from the Garner video has changed Orta, family members say. “He walks around with fear,” Lisa Mercado says. “He was always an outspoken person. He’s not anymore. He talks about, ‘Maybe I should just kill myself. I’m just hurting my entire family.’ He said he knew he was doing the right thing, but it turned out to be hell. It messed us all up.” Feidin Santana, a witness to the shooting of Walter Scott by Officer Michael Slager in North Charleston, S.C.Photograph by Sean Rayford for TIME Orta isn’t the only witness to a fatal police encounter whose life was changed after pulling out a smartphone. On April 11, Feidin Santana was walking to work in North Charleston, S.C., when he saw Walter Scott, a black man, fleeing from Michael Slager, a white police officer. Santana hit record on his phone as Slager fired eight shots at Scott’s back. The officer wasn’t initially charged, but after Santana’s video was released, Slager was fired and indicted for murder. In an interview with TIME, Santana says he has since moved out of North Charleston and no longer feels safe walking to the barbershop where he works. “I used to leave the barbershop at 10, 11 o’clock at night and go safely to my house,” Santana says. “Now, it’s not the same. I don’t feel that I should be doing that anymore.” Santana says he waited two days before handing the video over to Scott’s family, saying he even considered leaving North Charleston before making it public. “One of my concerns before giving the video to the family was retaliation from the police department,” he says. But after Santana saw what he considered inaccurate reports about the shooting, he decided to publicize the recording. Today, Santana says he tries to keep out of situations that could get him in trouble with the law. “Right now, I’m the only witness besides the ex-officer,” Santana says. “If it comes to a trial, it depends on me.” There have been several other instances of bystanders recording police encounters since Garner, including the arrest of 25-year-old Freddie Gray recorded by Baltimore resident Kevin Moore in April. Gray later died from a severe spinal injury while in police custody, which set off violent protests and led to the indictment of six officers involved in detaining Gray. In early June, 15-year-old Brandon Brooks recorded Eric Casebolt, a police officer in McKinney, Tex., pulling his gun at a pool party, detaining an unarmed black teenager wearing a bathing suit, and pinning her to the ground. Orta has followed some those incidents. But he says he’s far more concerned with his own life. “I got a lot more to deal with than worry about somebody else’s situation,” he says. Since he left Staten Island, Orta’s life has taken on shades of normalcy. He says he’s able to get out, go to the movies, stop by the grocery store. His mother says the cops in their new neighborhood don’t recognize them, so they don’t feel followed. Orta’s old life, however, may never return. He is currently facing charges of assault and harassment, robbery, criminal possession of a weapon, petty larceny, sale of an imitation controlled substance, and criminal possession of stolen property, among other lesser offenses. If convicted of all charges, he could be in prison until his 80s.\n —With reporting by Paul MoakleyDesign by Alexander Ho  Your browser is out of date.

A police officer shot Castile, 32, during a traffic stop, authorities said. Reynolds and her young daughter were in the car. “My daughter will be forever scarred by what the police at Falcon Heights did to us for no apparent reason,” she told the crowd. “They took my lifeblood. That was my best friend. I don’t have any family in Minnesota. I don’t have nobody,” she later added, sobbing. “I never got to say my last words to that man.” Reynolds, who was detained following the incident at about 9 p.m., said she was finally released and returned home about 5 a.m. Thursday. Castile was not the father of her daughter but still raised her as his own. Reynolds said. “It’s not fair and it’s not right,” she said. “I will not be able to sleep until I get justice. I need justice. And even after justice, this will never go away.” Reynolds says in the video that the vehicle was pulled over for a “busted taillight.” The officer asked Castile for his license and registration, she says. Castile reached for the information as requested and also informed the officer that he had a gun in the car and was licensed to carry before the officer opened fire, according to Reynolds. “Nothing within his body language said shoot me,” she told reporters Thursday.

Justice must be served if we’re going to have a chance to repair the terrible damage that has been done.” The governor said he was “forced to confront” the fact that “this kind of racism exists,” before suggesting that a white passenger would have been treated differently by police. “Would this have happened if those passengers, the driver and the passengers were white?” Dayton asked. “I don’t think it would have.” Dayton said that while facts still need to be surfaced, there’s “every indication” that the police officer’s decision to pull the trigger was “way in excess of what the situation called for.” Diamond Reynolds, the victim’s girlfriend who recorded video of the aftermath of the shooting, said their vehicle was pulled over for a “busted taillight.” The officer had asked Castile for his license and registration, she says.

The death’s of both Sterling and Castile sent shock waves throughout the country this week. The shooting of Sterling was captured on video and Castile’s girlfriend broadcast his killing’s aftermath on Facebook Live.

Minnesota’s governor called for a federal investigation into the shooting death of Castile Thursday, a black Minnesota man who was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop. Both deaths were recorded in videos that have since circulated widely. In the statement, Obama said that “to admit we’ve got a serious problem” does not contradict any respect or appreciation for police officers. Rather, the President said it accepts that “as a nation, we can and must do better to institute the best practices that reduce the appearance or reality of racial bias in law enforcement.” He mentioned recommendations from the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing as a guide for law enforcement reform. The task force was created after grand juries in New York and Ferguson, Mo., declined to charge two white police officers in the deaths of unarmed black men. “Regardless of the outcome of such investigations, what’s clear is that these fatal shootings are not isolated incidents,” Obama said in the statement. “They are symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal justice system, the racial disparities that appear across the system year after year, and the resulting lack of trust that exists between law enforcement and too many of the communities they serve.” Obama urged people to recognize the “anger, frustration and grief that so many Americans are feeling” and expressing through peaceful protests and vigils nationwide.  “Rather than fall into a predictable pattern of division and political posturing, let’s reflect on what we can do better. Let’s come together as a nation, and keep faith with one another, in order to ensure a future where all of our children know that their lives matter,” the President said.   Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4396075/community-remembers-alton-sterling-shooting-louisiana/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4396220/philando-castile-minnesota-shooting/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4396220/philando-castile-minnesota-shooting/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/3728880/task-force-police-shootings/?iid=sr-link1", "http://time.com/4396269/philando-castile-louisiana-minnesota-shooting-alton-sterling/?xid=homepage"], "sentiment_score": 0.0017676767676767643, "subjectivity_score": 0.36431818181818176},

I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe,” Beyoncé said. “But let’s be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things.” Her “Formation” song, which the singer also performed at the Super Bowl halftime show, was greeted by fans and critics as a celebration of the fight for equality — for women, for African Americans and for LGBTQ people. But it also drew the ire of police unions and even former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who argued that her Black Lives Matter message was antipolice, with some even calling for a boycott of her tour. (One shot in the “Formation” video shows “Stop Shooting Us” written in graffiti and the video ends with Beyoncé sinking into the water atop a police car.) Beyoncé fired back at such critics in her interview: “If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me,” she said. The “Formation” flap isn’t the first time that the pop superstar has come under fire for her politics, and Beyoncé also took the opportunity address her stance on feminism. While many (including this writer) applauded the singer for emblazoning the word feminist behind her during her Mrs. Carter tour, and defining it in her song “Flawless,” some objected to her use of the word. “I put the definition of feminist in my song [“Flawless”] and on my tour, not for propaganda or to proclaim to the world that I’m a feminist, but to give clarity to the true meaning,” Beyoncé told Elle. “I’m not really sure people know or understand what a feminist is, but it’s very simple. It’s someone who believes in equal rights for men and women,” she added. “I don’t understand the negative connotation of the word, or why it should exclude the opposite sex. If you are a man who believes your daughter should have the same opportunities and rights as your son, then you’re a feminist.” Beyoncé also clarified that the issues of race and gender are not mutually exclusive for her: “I don’t like or embrace any label. I don’t want calling myself a feminist to make it feel like that’s my one priority, over racism or sexism or anything else,” she said. “I’m just exhausted by labels and tired of being boxed in. If you believe in equal rights, the same way society allows a man to express his darkness, to express his pain, to express his sexuality, to express his opinion — I feel that women have the same rights.” The pop star is launching her own athletic clothing line, Ivy Park, this week.   Write to Eliana Dockterman at eliana.dockterman@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4210856/beyonce-formation-download-free-new-single-super-bowl-show/", "http://time.com/4210873/the-internet-is-freaking-out-about-beyonces-new-single/", "http://time.com/4211888/beyonce-formation-activism/", "http://time.com/4212367/beyonce-rudy-giuliani-super-bowl/", "http://time.com/1851/flawless-5-lessons-in-modern-feminism-from-beyonce/", "http://time.com/4277770/beyonce-ivy-park-activewear-clothing-line/"], "sentiment_score": 0.05389610389610391, "subjectivity_score": 0.4509348587920016},

A police officer shot Castile, 32, during a traffic stop, authorities said. Reynolds and her young daughter were in the car. “My daughter will be forever scarred by what the police at Falcon Heights did to us for no apparent reason,” she told the crowd. “They took my lifeblood. That was my best friend. I don’t have any family in Minnesota. I don’t have nobody,” she later added, sobbing. “I never got to say my last words to that man.” Reynolds, who was detained following the incident at about 9 p.m., said she was finally released and returned home about 5 a.m. Thursday. Castile was not the father of her daughter but still raised her as his own. Reynolds said. “It’s not fair and it’s not right,” she said. “I will not be able to sleep until I get justice. I need justice. And even after justice, this will never go away.” Reynolds says in the video that the vehicle was pulled over for a “busted taillight.” The officer asked Castile for his license and registration, she says. Castile reached for the information as requested and also informed the officer that he had a gun in the car and was licensed to carry before the officer opened fire, according to Reynolds. “Nothing within his body language said shoot me,” she told reporters Thursday.

Some of the details remain unclear, but here’s what to know about Philando Castile’s death so far: What happened? Police pulled over Philando Castile, 32, for driving with what his girlfriend Diamond Reynolds described as a “busted tail light.” Reynolds said the officer asked to see Castile’s license and registration after the traffic stop, prompting Castile to reach for the documents. Castile told police he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to Reynolds. At some point, the police officer opened fire. Reynolds began streaming the incident to Facebook Live shortly after the shooting. In the video, Castile is seen with a bloody shirt and the police officer’s gun is seen through the window. Reynolds’ daughter is in the back seat of the car. Castile was pronounced dead less than an hour later at a nearby hospital. Who was Castile? Castile was a cafeteria supervisor at a Montessori school where he had worked for more than a decade, according to a Minneapolis Star Tribune report. He grew up in St. Paul and also lived in Minneapolis. A cousin told the Star Tribune that Castile had been a straight-A student who graduated with honors from St. Paul Central High School. “They killed my son,” Valerie Castile, Philando’s mother, said after learning of his death, according to the Star Tribune. “They took a good man, a hard-working man; he worked since he was 18 years old.” Who are the officers? The officer who fired has not been identified. Police officials said he has been placed on paid administrative leave. What happens next? The interim chief of the St. Anthony Police Department said the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is leading an investigation into the death. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said Thursday that he has asked the U.S. Department of Justice to launch an independent investigation. In the meantime, protesters have gathered in the state capital.

He’s not a thug. He’s very respectable and I know he didn’t antagonize that officer in any way.” “We’re being hunted every day,” she later added. “It’s a silent war against African-American people as a whole. We’re never free.” The aftermath of the shooting was captured on video, which was streamed on Facebook Live by the victim’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds. The video shows Philando Castile covered in blood as he’s slumped in the driver’s seat of a vehicle. “Police just shot my boyfriend for no apparent reason,” Reynolds says. St. Anthony Police interim police chief Jon Mangseth told the Associated Press that a police officer pulled over a vehicle around 9 p.m. in Falcon Heights and that “shots were fired” during the stop, but did not immediately provide more details.

Castile reached for the information as requested and also informed the officer that he had a gun in the car and was licensed to carry before the officer opened fire, according to Reynolds. The victim’s uncle, Clarence Castile, said he was horrified by what he saw in the footage, saying there was “blood everywhere.” “He’s not an officer. He’s just a man.

They eventually decided on Buffalo Wild Wings, but Garner never made it. Soon, a fight broke out nearby, Orta says, and after Garner helped break it up, New York Police Department officers on the scene accused Garner of selling untaxed cigarettes and attempted to arrest him. Garner, a 43-year-old father of six who was unarmed at the time, argued with the officers about why he was being targeted. To corral Garner, one officer used what appeared to be a chokehold, a technique banned by the NYPD. Several others helped drag him to the ground. Garner, who had a history of health problems, died soon after. Orta recorded the incident on his phone and the video has helped turn the fatal encounter from a local tragedy into a national debate over the use of force by police. Orta, 22, says he’s known Garner for several years and called him “the neighborhood dad.” Orta’s video shows what appears to be one officer pressing Garner’s face into the sidewalk as other officers attempt to subdue him. On the ground, Garner can be heard repeatedly saying “I can’t breathe.” “I felt like they treated him wrong even after the fact that they had him contained,” Orta says. Since Orta’s video became public after being published by the New York Daily News, the officer who grabbed Garner by the neck, Daniel Pantaleo, was ordered to turn in his badge and gun; another was reassigned to desk duty. The four emergency medical workers who responded to the scene have also been suspended without pay. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was “very troubled” by the footage, and both prosecutors and the NYPD are investigating the incident. Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, criticized the department’s response as “a completely unwarranted, kneejerk reaction for political reasons and nothing more.” Orta recorded another violent arrest at the same location in Staten Island a week earlier. He says officers have harassed him since the Garner video became public, but he says he isn’t likely to put his camera away if something happens in his Staten Island neighborhood again. “It just gives me more power to not be afraid to pull out my camera anytime,” he says. “Even if they’re pushing me back, I might just like keep going forward and if I get arrested, hey, I got something on camera.” Video reported by Paul Moakley, edited by Raymond Chu Read next: No Charges for Officer Who Put Eric Garner in Deadly Chokehold  Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3616780/eric-garner-chokehold-new-york-staten-lisland/?xid=time_readnext"], "sentiment_score": -0.0505485893416928, "subjectivity_score": 0.33337251828631137},

Supporters of Alton Sterling, who was killed early Tuesday while police apparently pinned him down outside a convenience store, called for the police chief to be fired or resign and urged residents to boycott the local mall after the fatal shooting. “I, for one, will not rest or not allow him to be swept in the dirt,” said Quinyetta McMillon, 31, the mother of Sterling’s 15-year-old son. The teenager, Cameron Sterling, sobbed loudly and was overcome with emotion as his mother spoke at a news conference. Sterling’s death, which sparked protests in Baton Rouge, was caught in a graphic video, which was widely shared on social media. The footage appears to show two officers approaching Sterling outside of a convenience store. One officer appears to tackle him over the hood of the car, then both pounce on him, apparently to restrain him on the pavement. “As this video has been shared across the world, you will see with your own eyes how he was handled unjustly and killed without regard for the lives that he helped raise,” McMillon, who is not married to Sterling, told reporters. “As a mother, I have now been forced to raise a son who is going to remember what happened to his father that I can’t take away from him,” she added. “He is at an age of understanding. I hurt more for him and his loss.” McMillon wept as she said the greatest failure as a parent is “to see your child hurt and know there’s nothing you can do about it.” Michael McClanahan, head of the NAACP in Baton Rouge, called for Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. to be fired. “He must step down. We cannot have anybody who allows this type of action to take place,” he said. Dabadie said at a news conference that he would not resign and said those who are asking for him to step down from his post were “acting off emotion.” “I’m not retiring. I’m not resigning,” he added later. “I don’t think it’s fair for people to act out of emotion. We have done a lot of good in this community. We’re working diligently to bring the truth out.” Abdul Rashid Muhammad, who leads the local chapter of the Nation of Islam, urged supporters to boycott the Louisiana mall, starting Friday “until we get justice.” “Let’s withhold our money,” he said. “Don’t spend anything.” Sandra Sterling, the aunt of the slain man who raised him, said she was grateful for the unknown bystander who recorded the video but that she was “very disturbed” and “hurt” at what she saw in the footage. “It’s a horrible thing to happen to him,” she told reporters Wednesday. “He didn’t deserve that.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4394411/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-shooting/", "http://time.com/4395056/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-police-chief/"], "sentiment_score": 0.029493464052287567, "subjectivity_score": 0.32957516339869275},

Last night in Dallas, five law enforcement officers were killed; seven officers and two civilians were wounded. The coordinated ambush and deliberate, brutal executions were acts of cowardice – hiding behind innocents to target and savagely slaughter peace officers dedicated to preserving life and our freedoms. The full force of the law must ensure all responsible are brought to justice and our communities are kept secure. Justice will be served, but justice is small solace for the families left behind. We mourn for the families of the fallen, for the law enforcement community and for our nation. Respect for our law enforcement officers must be restored in our nation. The badge every officer wears over his or her heart is a reminder of a sacred trust, a commitment, a contract with each of us. For law enforcement officers to stand in front of us and all that threatens, we must stand behind them. Every life matters. With each innocent life lost, we lose more of our humanity. It is time for us to unite as Texans, as Americans, to say no more. No more will we tolerate disrespect for those who serve. No more will we allow the evil of hate merchants to tear us apart. Though anguish and sorrow may darken the days ahead, we will not be overcome by evil – we will overcome evil with good. Texas is an exceptional state with exceptional people. We’ve faced tough challenges in the past, but we have come together to overcome those challenges. In the coming days, there will be those who foment distrust and fan the flames of dissension. To come together – that would be the greatest rebuke to those who seek to tear us apart. There is far more that binds us together. We see that great strength in times of tragedy, in times of great need. Whether fire or flood or the acts of depraved individuals, Texans are the first to open their hearts, their homes, their wallets to offer charity and love.

And race is complicated.” He called on people to consider both sides of the complicated debate, denouncing police brutality while praising honorable law enforcement officers. “The question is: Can we, as citizens, speak against the actions of a relatively few officers who blemish the reputation of their high-calling and at the same time, support and defend the 99% of officers who do their job professionally, honestly and bravely?” he said. “I think we can and I think we must.” He also asked the community to “truly and deeply understand” the pain caused by racial discrimination and slavery, which he called “the greatest sin in America.” Write to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4397911/dallas-police-shooting-victims-sniper/", "http://time.com/4397785/dallas-shooting-police-protest-snipers/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4396220/philando-castile-minnesota-shooting/", "http://time.com/4396269/philando-castile-louisiana-minnesota-shooting-alton-sterling/"], "sentiment_score": -0.04113756613756615, "subjectivity_score": 0.5502645502645502},

Brown has seen loss from several perspectives: He lost his former partner in the line of duty, his brother due to crime and his son after he killed a police officer. As Dallas reels from shootings that left five officers dead and seven others wounded, Brown has been thrust into the national spotlight. Here’s what you need to know. He lost his former partner in a fatal shooting In 1988, Brown was called to the scene of an officer-involved shooting only to learn that his former police academy classmate and partner had been ambushed and shot in the head. Walter L. Williams, a father of three, died in the hospital hours later. “When things like that happen and you’re really close, you don’t believe it for the longest time,” he told the Dallas Morning News when he was sworn in as chief in 2010. “I really relate to all of those in-the-line-of-duty deaths [on a] much more personal level … you lose a partner, you just never get over it.” His brother was killed by drug dealers In 1991, his younger brother Kelvin was killed in the Phoenix area by drug dealers. Brown doesn’t speak much about the event, but he told the Morning News that it deepened his understanding of his job. “I can’t deny that’s a part of who I am,” he told the newspaper. “The families of victims, I know what they go through. My family had to go through that. But does it make me police in a different manner or lead in a different manner? I’m not sure.” His son killed a police officer and a bystander In 2010, the same year Brown was sworn in as chief, his son began acting erratically at an apartment complex in the Dallas suburb of Lancaster, then shot and killed a stranger and a police officer before being killed by police himself. Brown later took off his badge to meet with the family of the victims. “David was very humble. You know, he never made any excuses for his son. David’s a strong, Christian man, and so he relies on his faith to get through each day, and that was demonstrated during the whole incident that happened in Lancaster,” former Lancaster Police Chief Keith Humphrey told TIME. Humphrey, who is now chief of police in Norman, Okla., said he has known Brown in a professional capacity for almost a decade. He helped facilitate the meetings between Brown and the victims’ families but did not stay. “What I do remember hearing David say as I’m walking out of the room, exiting the room, that he said, first of all, ‘I’m very sorry, and that is not the way I raised my son.’ I don’t know what else happened inside those meetings, they were very private. But I think that helped all three families start healing,” Humphrey said. He’s intensely private Brown is known for not having many personal friends and disliking sitting down with the media. He runs his own Twitter account in part to control his public messages. Anna Hill, president of the Dolphins Heights Neighborhood Association in Dallas, said she has known Brown for a long time, but she still mostly talks to him for professional reasons, but that he’s always responsive. “He takes his job seriously. He takes community seriously,” she told TIME. “If we have a problem in our neighborhood and we contact him, he answers.” Humphrey described Brown as “introverted,” but a dynamic leader. “It’s not about David, it’s about others,” Humphrey said. “David is an amazing leader. What you see is what you get on TV. He’s not putting on an act, and he’s definitely not performing for the media. David cares. He’s hurting.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.010315904139433556, "subjectivity_score": 0.3096786492374728},

The Justice Department has opened a civil rights probe into Sterling’s fatal shooting, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said at a news conference. The department confirmed the start of the investigation on Twitter. Edwards said there should be “no doubt in anybody’s mind” that the investigation will be conducted fairly and thoroughly. “When the community understands that, the tensions will ease and we’ll continue to press for calm and patience,” he told reporters. “That’s what I’m asking for right now.” BREAKING: DOJ has opened a civil rights investigation into the death of Alton Sterling. Sterling, 37, was shot dead while police apparently pinned him down outside a convenience store. The incident was caught on video and prompted calls for boycotts of the local mall and for the police chief to be fired or resign. Baton Rouge Police said two officers responded to a disturbance call outside the store about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday. A caller told a dispatcher that a black man in a red shirt who was selling CDs had threatened him with a gun. “An altercation between Sterling and the officers ensued. Sterling was shot during the altercation and died at the scene,” the police department said in a statement. The two officers have been placed on administrative leave. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama is aware of the situation in Baton Rouge but Earnest declined to comment further, citing the Justice Department investigation. “Regardless of what the investigation finds, there is a family in Baton Rouge and there’s a community that’s grieving right now,” Earnest said. “We’re thinking about them as they endure that grief.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4394664/alton-sterling-family-baton-rouge-police-shooting/", "http://time.com/4394411/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-shooting/"], "sentiment_score": 0.0420256991685563, "subjectivity_score": 0.35366591080876797},

Williams won BET’s Humanitarian Award last month and used his acceptance speech to deliver a powerful message regarding race and justice. The speech has since gone viral — it’s been watched over 3 million times on Facebook and been praised by fellow celebrities like Justin Timberlake and Mira Nair. But some unhappy onlookers pushed for Williams to be kicked off of Grey’s Anatomy. Change.org user Erin Smith created a petition urging ABC to fire Williams for his “racist rant.” Smith wrote that Williams’s BET acceptance speech was “a racist, hate speech against law enforcement and white people.” She also used the hashtags “#AllLivesMatter” and “#EqualConsequences4RacistBehavior.” The petition had more than 5,000 signatures as of Tuesday morning. Rhimes took to Twitter to show her support for Williams. In woods. Far from wifi. Get signal! What'd I miss? \"Just because we're magic doesn't mean we're not real.\" @iJesseWilliams' speech. YES. She then retweeted this post from Williams, which many believe refers to the petition: Do not promote empty people & their tantrums. Pure clickbait to gain followers, attention & money, for themselves, not you. Never you. And finally, Rhimes chimed in about the petition itself. Um, people?

We live here, we pay taxes, we should be able to talk about it.” The Grey’s Anatomy actor, who received the BET humanitarian award, condemned police brutality in his speech and invoked the names of black people who have been killed by law enforcement officers.

People are out here poor, and abandoned, and unsupported, and just because we get to be here tonight doesn’t mean that we’ve made it. We ain’t made it.” He also told Entertainment Tonight on Sunday that his award represented a larger movement gaining traction. “I’m here for all the incredible protestors, activists, attorneys, organizers that are sacrificing [an] incredibly great deal to be heard and get access to equal rights and justice in this country,” he said. “[The BET Awards] recognizing me is really recognizing them in my view, and I think that means that we’re getting traction.” Write to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4383413/jesse-williams-bet-speech/", "http://time.com/3547875/jesse-williams-ferguson-michael-brown-trayvon-martin/", "http://time.com/4383516/jesse-williams-bet-speech-transcript/"], "sentiment_score": 0.15132575757575759, "subjectivity_score": 0.46064814814814814},

The outspoken human rights activist—who executive produced the recent documentary, Stay Woke: The Black Lives Matter Movement— delivered a powerful and political speech about the cause he’s worked so hard on. Referencing recent victims of police brutality, Williams discussed the violence against black people and the struggles they’ve faced throughout history: “There has been no war that we have not fought and died on the front lines of. There has been no job we haven’t done. There is no tax they haven’t leveed against us,” he said. The speech received a standing ovation by the audience, who went on to praise Williams on Twitter. A transcript of it has been published in multiple places, including The Washington Post and Bustle. Below, Genius‘s account of the speech: Peace peace. Thank you, Debra. Thank you, BET. Thank you Nate Parker, Harry and Debbie Allen for participating in that {video}. Before we get into it, I just want to say I brought my parents out tonight. I just want to thank them for being here, for teaching me to focus on comprehension over career, and that they make sure I learn what the schools were afraid to teach us. And also thank my amazing wife for changing my life. Now, this award – this is not for me. This is for the real organizers all over the country – the activists, the civil rights attorneys, the struggling parents, the families, the teachers, the students that are realizing that a system built to divide and impoverish and destroy us cannot stand if we do. It’s kind of basic mathematics – the more we learn about who we are and how we got here, the more we will mobilize. Now, this is also in particular for the black women in particular who have spent their lifetimes dedicated to nurturing everyone before themselves. We can and will do better for you. Now, what we’ve been doing is looking at the data and we know that police somehow manage to deescalate, disarm and not kill white people everyday. So what’s going to happen is we are going to have equal rights and justice in our own country or we will restructure their function and ours. Now… I got more y’all – yesterday would have been young Tamir Rice’s 14th birthday so I don’t want to hear anymore about how far we’ve come when paid public servants can pull a drive-by on 12 year old playing alone in the park in broad daylight, killing him on television and then going home to make a sandwich. Tell Rekia Boyd how it’s so much better than it is to live in 2012 than it is to live in 1612 or 1712. Tell that toEric Garner. Tell that to Sandra Bland. Tell that to Dorian Hunt. Now the thing is, though, all of us in here getting money – that alone isn’t gonna stop this. Alright, now dedicating our lives, dedicating our lives to getting money just to give it right back for someone’s brand on our body when we spent centuries praying with brands on our bodies, and now we pray to get paid for brands on our bodies. There has been no war that we have not fought and died on the front lines of. There has been no job we haven’t done. There is no tax they haven’t leveed against us – and we’ve paid all of them. But freedom is somehow always conditional here. “You’re free,” they keep telling us. But she would have been alive if she hadn’t acted so… free. Now, freedom is always coming in the hereafter, but you know what, though, the hereafter is a hustle. We want it now. And let’s get a couple things straight, just a little sidenote – the burden of the brutalized is not to comfort the bystander.That’s not our job, alright – stop with all that. If you have a critique for the resistance, for our resistance, then you better have an established record of critique of our oppression. If you have no interest, if you have no interest in equal rights for black people then do not make suggestions to those who do. Sit down. We’ve been floating this country on credit for centuries, yo, and we’re done watching and waiting while this invention called whiteness uses and abuses us, burying black people out of sight and out of mind while extracting our culture, our dollars, our entertainment like oil – black gold, ghettoizing and demeaning our creations then stealing them, gentrifying our genius and then trying us on like costumes before discarding our bodies like rinds of strange fruit. The thing is though… the thing is that just because we’re magic doesn’t mean we’re not real. Thank you.

Five police officers were killed and seven wounded after at least two snipers began shooting at 8:45 p.m. from “elevated positions” on Thursday in downtown Dallas. The city’s Mayor Mike Rawlings told a press conference on Friday that all the officers killed were men. Among the injured, three officers were female. Two civilian bystanders were also injured, a man and a woman. Shetamia Taylor, who was attending the protest with her sons, was named by the Associated Press as being injured after being shot in the leg. Speaking to People, Marvin Pabon described the Black Lives Matter rally as “a really cool, chill environment” in the moments leading up to the attack. “Everyone was having such a great time,” he told People. At around 9pm he heard at least 30 gun shots, “it was just way too many shots,” Pabon says. “I would never have figured Dallas would be a war zone. ” Witness Cortney Washington only saw police officers getting attacked and did not know where the shots were being fired from, speaking to NBC Dallas-Fort Worth she said: “I didn’t see anybody else get shot, just the cops. I saw cops getting shot, right there in plain sight…while we was running, like, they just kept shooting.” “We were leaving, and when we turned, there was cops. They were patrolling. Then, all of a sudden, you’ve seen them just fall,” a woman who did not want to give her name told NBC. Speaking to The Dallas Morning News, local resident Carol Harris said that the killers “were strategic. It was tap tap pause. Tap tap pause.” “Everyone just started running,” 21-year-old Devante Odom, told the Morning News. “We lost touch with two of our friends just trying to get out of there.” Video footage from the event saw dozens of people from the crowd running as shots rang out on the street, with another clip showing one of the snipers shooting from behind a pillar. An estimated 800 protestors and 100 officers were present at the rally against fatal shootings by police in two separate incidents this week. “Pop, pause, pop, pause. Then you see the first two officers go down,” said Jamal Johnson to the Daily Beast, explaining that police officers were initially unable to figure out where the shots were coming from. “The other officers began to think that the protesters were the ones who were actually firing, but the protesters were peaceful. They were running for their lives. They were terrified,” he says. “They fired about 14, 15 return shots once they realized where the shooters were shooting from,” he said. “When we came tonight everything was so peaceful, man. It was united…and for them [the shooters] to ruin it like that.” Amid the ensuing chaos, the police allegedly misidentified an activist for open carry, Mark Hughes, as a suspect. Speaking to KTVT, Hughes claimed the police interrogated him and falsely said that they had surveillance footage of him firing a weapon. “It was persecution on me,” he told KTVT. “I could’ve easily been shot.” Police say the shootings appeared to have been planned, with the gunmen displaying knowledge of the rally’s intended path. Two suspects were apprehended, and two camouflage bags were recovered. Police engaged in a gun battle at a a parking garage downtown, which ended after the suspect died. Another suspect, who was female, was arrested close to the garage where the stand-off was taking place.   Renee Sifflet told the Morning News that she had taken her children to the rally “for a positive experience, something they could say they were part of when they’re older,” but it had instead “turned negative.” From a NATO summit in Warsaw, President Barack Obama called the assault a “vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement” and said that he spoke “for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4397785/dallas-shooting-police-protest-snipers/", "http://time.com/4397785/dallas-shooting-police-protest-snipers/?xid=homepage"], "sentiment_score": -0.007349132349132353, "subjectivity_score": 0.39016631516631517},

The grand jury decided there was not enough evidence to file charges against officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner, following an altercation with a group of officers on July 17 that was videotaped by one of the victim’s friends. Officers suspected Garner of selling untaxed cigarettes and attempted to detain him, which Garner protested. The footage depicts several officers forcing Garner, 43, to the ground while Pantaleo puts him in what appears to be a chokehold, an aggressive move that is banned by the city’s police department. In the video, which went viral, Garner can be heard repeatedly saying, “I can’t breathe.” That phrase has been frequently invoked at protests around the country. A city medical examiner later ruled Garner’s death a homicide caused by “compression of the neck.” Although several officers were involved in Garner’s arrest, Panteleo was the only one who faced a potential indictment in the fatal encounter. President Barack Obama later weighed in from Washington, among several cities where demonstrations would pop up on split-screen news segments next to analysts going over the fallout. “When anybody in this country is not being treated equally under the law, that is a problem and it’s my job as President to help solve it,” he said. The grand jury’s decision came just over a week after the announcement that Darren Wilson, a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., would not be indicted in the August shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. That news ignited a night of looting, arson and riots in the St. Louis suburb, and touched off demonstrations from New York to Los Angeles. “It’s a very painful day for many New Yorkers” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in an afternoon news conference. “No family should have to go through what the Garner family went through.” MORE: Justice Department to Investigate Eric Garner’s Death A small but fierce crowd gathered at Union Square soon after the announcement was made public. Some demonstrators led chants of “Indict! Convict!” and “The whole damn system is going to hell!” Others had tears streaming down their faces and held up their smartphones to capture the protest. Many said they were not shocked to see jurors decline to indict the officer. “No, when you’re black, you can’t be surprised,” said Omar Holmon, 29, a writer and performer. “The worst part is feeling numb to it.” The march snowballed in size as it snaked north to Rockefeller Center, where the annual Christmas tree lighting was due to take place, causing the protestors to mix in with tourists. Chants of “Am I next?” were punctuated with calls of “Don’t ruin my Christmas!” and frantic gesturing of out-of-towners lost in the crowd. “I’m tired of seeing people who look like me get killed,” Holmon added, holding back tears. “I want justice.” Just as they did after Fergson, a number of elected officials spoke out Wednesday in the wake of the announcement. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer tweeted that the Justice Department needed to launch a federal investigation into Garner’s death “as soon as possible.” And Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand called the fatal incident “a tragedy that demands accountability.” MORE: Behind the Video of Eric Garner’s Deadly Confrontation With New York Police Local, state and federal officials have received rampant condemnation over the police-involved deaths this year of unarmed black men like Brown and Garner, as well as the Cleveland police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Obama recently announced the launch of a national task force that would aim to improve trust between police departments and communities of color. In addition, he said a three-year, $263 million package would expand the use of body cameras among police officers and increase their training for surplus military equipment. The nation’s top cop also held a brief news conference Wednesday evening, saying the Justice Department would launch a civil-rights inquiry into Garner’s death. Federal prosecutors would conduct an “independent, thorough, fair and expeditious investigation,” Attorney General Eric Holder said. “His death was a great tragedy,” he added. “All lives must be valued, all lives.” As the night went on, protestors in New York fanned out into the streets and blocked traffic as officers kept pace. At one point, a group of protestors took over a section of the West Side Highway, resulting in a handful being detained. Police said there were at least 30 arrests around Manhattan as of 10:15 p.m., local time.

Forget the angry cries of sexism. Millennials have grown up admiring a woman who says she’s “Crazy in Love” with one of the most powerful men in music and expresses her desire to please him while still projecting a fierce, independent persona. Why should my generation adopt the traditional “a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle” version of feminism? Even as modern day pundits like Hanna Rosin, Maureen Dowd and Sheryl Sandberg have picked up the baton, speculating about the “end of men” and the perils of letting your career be derailed by family, Beyoncé has managed to become the biggest female pop star in the world while cultivating her marriage, her role as a mother, and her sexuality. And in doing so, she’s ushering in a new wave of feminism. In fact, Beyoncé is one of the few superstars who’s actually claimed the scary title of “feminist.” Nonetheless, she hasn’t always had the feminists on her side. Their biggest critique of the pop icon’s work before this album was that she sang about men…almost exclusively — from “Love on Top” to “Halo.” Let’s be honest, even the girl anthem songs about breakups made our eyes roll: it was hard to dance along to “Irreplaceable” or “Single Ladies” without remembering that Jay Z had “put a ring on it.” And it didn’t help that the name of her latest tour was “Mrs. Carter.” But she does something new on Beyoncé — a collection of music and videos which has already broken an iTunes record by selling 823,773 copies in its first three days. Men and love are a focus, but she makes sure to let us know that those songs are also about empowerment: there’s even a spoken word passage in “Flawless” from a Nigerian feminist that calls for young girls to “lean in” and be more than someone’s wife. She sings about love and sex more boldly than ever, peppering those songs with messages about independence and motherhood. And we’re eating it up. Maybe the reason my millennial generation feels so entitled is partially because Beyoncé told us we could be. We can have it all. But don’t take my word for it. Look at the lyrics of Beyoncé. There are feminist lessons for every woman entwined among the usual addictive musical riffs.   1.“Pretty Hurts” — Obsessing about your looks is destructive. Pretty hurts Shine the light on whatever’s worse Perfection is the disease of a nation …It’s the soul that needs surgery Okay, yes, you have to get past the fact that this is being sung by one of the most beautiful women on the planet. But after Britney Spears’ “Work B****” from earlier this year — which told women they had to look hot to get what they wanted — it’s comforting to know that the problem is with society, not with us. Even perfect Beyoncé, who tried to clear the Internet of unflattering photos of herself after her Super Bowl performance and who has openly spoken about struggling with body image issues, feels the pressure of unfair expectations. 2. “Blow” — Sexual pleasure should be a two way street.  Keep me coming…Keep me humming, keep me moaning… Don’t stop loving ‘til the morning… Can you lick my skittles? That’s the sweetest in the middle Pink that’s the flavor Solve the riddle… I can’t wait til I get home so you can turn that cherry out We hear a lot about oral sex in rap songs (“She lick me like a lollipop,” anyone?). But when’s the last time you heard a song about a woman being on the receiving side? Women of the world, Beyoncé is telling you to get yours too. 3. “Partition” — It’s important to please your man (yep, that’s feminist). Driver roll up the partition please I don’t need you seeing ’yoncé on her knees Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up We ain’t even gonna make it to this club… Oh he so horny, yeah he want to f*** He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown… Take all of me I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like “I just wanna be the girl you like” isn’t the most feminist message — especially compared to the rest of the album. It’s not a give and take like “Blow.” It’s simple submission. How do you reconcile being a proud, independent woman and wanting to be desirable and please to your man? But wait! Beyoncé has an explanation. You might have missed it because it’s in French, but it’s there. Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe? Le sexe, je veux dire l’activité physique, le coit, tu aimes ça? Tu ne t’intéresses pas a sexe? Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c’est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent The translation, thanks to one of my French-speaking co-workers: Do you like sex? Sex, I mean the physical activity, coitus, do you like it? You’re not interested in sex? Men think that feminists hate sex, but it’s a very stimulating and natural activity that women love. The Dude fans might recognize this as Julianne Moore’s monologue in The Big Lebowski. The message: feminists like sex too. So brush up on your French, haters. 4. “Mine” — Motherhood and relationships aren’t easy — even for Beyoncé. I’ve been watching for the signs Took a trip to clear my mind… Been having conversations about breakups and separations I’m not feeling like myself since the baby Are we even gonna make it? Cause if we are, we’re taking this a little too far… All that I can think of is, we should get married We should get married Let’s stop holding back on this and let’s get carried away Beyoncé doesn’t reveal too much about her relationship with Jay Z. She has sung before about breakups and possible infidelity (“Irreplaceable” in 2006, “Jealous” in this album), but who knows about whether that’s about Jay Z or a past boyfriend or nobody at all? What we can take away is that it’s okay to want to get married as a feminist. And, perhaps more importantly, it’s okay to have problems with and doubts about your love life. Plus, unlike so many feminist icons, she admits that you can’t just pick up your life as usual after having a child. 5.“Flawless” — Be more than someone’s wife. I took some time to live my life But don’t think I’m just his little wife Don’t get it twisted, get it twisted This my shit, bow down b*****s The message is pretty clear. But then there’s the interlude by Nigerian-born writer and feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The song excerpts the author’s TED Talk on feminism: We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller We say to girls: “You can have ambition, but not too much You should aim to be successful, but not too successful Otherwise, you will threaten the man.” Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is most important Now, marriage can be a source of joy and low and mutual support But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don’t teach boys the same? We raise girls to see each other as competitors Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing But for the attention of men We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way boys are Feminist: a person who believes in the social, Political, and economic equality of the sexes Those feminist words can seem at odds with Beyoncé’s videos. Are we supposed to have a problem with the fact that Beyoncé is advocating that our society stop thinking of women as wives and sex objects as she grinds up on her husband in a leotard? I think we are. I think she wants us to think about how much of what she does is empowerment and how much is driven by the norms of popular culture. And, again, she wants us to think that you can be both sexy and a feminist. (Feminists like sex too, remember?) Maybe I’m giving her too much credit, and it’s just hypocritical when she sarcastically sings, “I just woke up like this” with her perfectly manicured outfit and makeup. But Beyoncé’s resume is so full, that being married to Jay Z probably wouldn’t even make the cut. And after a year of Miley Cyrus’ tongue-wagging and naked “Blurred Lines” backup dancers, it’s sure nice to have a pop star return who wants to be a role model.

The former New York City mayor appeared on Fox & Friends on Monday to weigh in on the halftime show in which Beyonce appears to allude to the Black Lives Matter movement and give the “Black Power” salute. “I think it was outrageous,” he said. “This is football, not Hollywood, and I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive.” “What we should be doing in the African-American community, and all communities, is build up respect for police officers,” Giuliani added. “And focus on the fact that when something does go wrong, OK. We’ll work on that. But the vast majority of police officers risk their lives to keep us safe.” The superstar’s backup dancers wore black berets as they formed an “X,” which many on social media took as a nod to the Black Panthers, during the performance of Beyonce’s newly dropped single “Formation.” In the video for the single, the phrase “stop shooting us” is written in graffiti on a white brick wall.

The world would have Queen Bey letting braided extensions and fur coat fly, dancers in thigh-high stockings and booty shorts dropping it low in hotel hallways and parking lots, elegant sisters fanning themselves like queens, and black girls laughing and playing. If all these seem like things you’ve seen in other Beyonce videos, well, that’s precisely my point. Beyonce’s glittering black girl magic—no, her black grown woman magic—has always been a political statement: an act of black feminist world-making that imagines how black women can survive and create their own, unmatchable value. The music video to Beyonce’s new single “Formation,” which she performed during the Super Bowl Sunday, is being quickly labeled as political because of its references to Hurricane Katrina and Black Lives Matter protests. But “Formation” differs radically from other post-Ferguson protests songs like Trip Lee’s “Coulda Been Me” or Rihanna’s “American Oxygen” video, which focus on black men’s deaths.  Beyonce’s celebration of her formation—her heritage, her fine form, her politics—is a tapestry of black women’s colorful, textured lives, which refuse to become the living deaths that feminist foremother Audre Lorde warned us about. While some activists call on African Americans to get militant in response to injustice, Beyonce asks ladies to get in formation, to stand side by side and show everyone we’re still here and “we gon’ slay, slay.”  In Bey’s black feminist formation, black women spend time in one another’s company—in a Storyville hotel, a hair shop, a parking lot, a church, an empty swimming pool—and enjoy their bodies in all their blackness and womanness. This song is all about the pleasures of having a black female body and owning it. “Cocky fresh” Bey calls her black feminist aesthetic. Cocky, as in enjoying pleasure with a sense of controlling her own sexuality that’s usually reserved for men: “When he f— me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster, cause I slay” she sings, letting us know having good sex is all about flexing her power in a relationship. She slays while he has to scramble to earn post-sex rewards. Bey revels in her Southernness black womanness: “I like my baby hair, with baby hairs and afros,” she drawls, singing her love not only of black girls’ kinky, coily and curly hair but also of black Southern women’s speech. Yes, Beyonce’s black feminism is a politics of the pleasures reserved for black women: our country roots, our nappy roots, our Cheddar Bay Biscuits, our well-eaten cake by the pound. But don’t get it twisted: Bey’s black feminism isn’t only for cis-women. The song starts with a voiceover from media personality Messy Mya, killed in an unsolved transphobic murder in 2010, who tells us “Bitch, I’m back by popular demand.” “Formation” also features queer New Orleans queen of bounce Big Freedia and footage from Abteen Bagheri’s 2014 documentary That B.E.A.T, which explores New Orleans bounce music and queer culture. Femme and fabulous, Beyonce’s formation loves and celebrates the art of black femininity in every kind of body brave enough to own it.  As sociologist Zandria Robinson writes: “‘Formation’ is an homage to and recognition of the werk of the ‘punks, bulldaggers, and welfare queens’ in these Southern streets and parking lots, in these second lines, in these chocolate cities and neighborhoods, in front of these bands and drumlines.” Most of all, Beyonce’s black feminism celebrates conjure women and the magic they wield.  Yes, “Formation” evokes New Orleans’ Hoodoo and Voodoo traditions with Bey in witchy black before an abandoned plantation house. But I also mean conjure in the sense of marrying dreams, work and power to create a new world—a world where black women own their bodies, pleasures, and possibilities. “I dream it, I work hard, I grind ‘til I own it,” Bey sings, and I believe her. Conjure women have become important figures for black feminists who refuse to accept the world we’ve been given. “In societies in which race and class are defining attributes of one’s life, the conjure woman’s spiritual disposition affords her the flexibility and prerogative to manipulate such confining spaces… to create safe, protective spaces for other people of color,” said Africana scholar Kameelah Martin. And while most of us don’t visit conjure women any more, we can still visit Beyonce’s world to watch black women elevated to the divas and dieties we deserve to be. “What a time to be black and alive!” The Cut’s Ashley Weatherford wrote when she saw “Formation.” And in a period that’s seen so much violence and heartbreak leveled against black women, anything that can make a sister feel like that is black feminist magic, pure and simple. Slay, Queen Bey.

After 90 days of hearings and meetings with a wide range of civil rights groups and local police agencies, the Task Force on 21st Century Policing included the recommendation in its first report Monday. It notes that a 1994 law requires the Department of Justice to gather data about excessive force by police officers and publish an annual summary but notes that has never been done in a “serious and sustained” way. The report also suggests that local agencies adopt more of a community policing approach, minimize the use of military equipment at protests and rallies and have outside investigators look into police shootings. But it stopped short of endorsing widespread adoption of body cameras, an idea which first came up after a shooting in Ferguson, Mo. Task force members said that body cameras could be helpful but that privacy concerns need to be considered first. “Any technology we apply, we need to understand its usefulness,” said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, the co-chair of the task force, on a call with reporters Monday. “But we also need to make sure we’re working within a constitutional framework.” “Today we’re talking about body cameras, but tomorrow it will be something else,” Ramsey added. Marc Morial, president of the civil rights organization National Urban League, which called for more body cameras in testimony to the task force, praised the recommendations for independent investigators, but said that not coming down hard in favor of body and dashboard cameras a “missed opportunity.” “Privacy concerns that might be there are not enough to put the breaks on an idea whose time has come,” Morial tells TIME. Aside from the specific recommendations, the report stresses the need for police to establish trust and demonstrate transparency to the communities they serve. The task force makes some evergreen calls to action like engaging with community members and better addressing prejudice, while also calling on the federal government to take a hard look at criminal justice policies such as sentencing and reentry and societal issues like poverty and education that can further exacerbate police distrust. Many of the federal task force’s recommendations align with similar calls made by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which released a report on community-police relations in January. Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson of Gary, Ind., says that the report rightfully acknowledges that the federal government’s role in improving police-community relations is limited. “It acknowledges that while there can be guidance and training and technical assistance that can be provided at the federal level, there really has to be a local approach and a local commitment to addressing those concerns,” she said. Gene Voegtlin, a spokesman for the International Association of Chiefs of Police says, “This is more than just a police issue,” says “It’s a criminal justice system issue, and honestly probably a societal issue.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/interim_tf_report.pdf"], "sentiment_score": 0.07291908633372049, "subjectivity_score": 0.35619434765776226},

If regulators make too many laws now, warned the head of policy from X (formerly GoogleX), “the cold, dry text” will stymie the most cutting edge technology. If business leaders aren’t uber-transparent about why they believe their self-driving vehicles are safe, cautioned a law professor, the crucial element of public opinion won’t be on their side. And if we’re not realistic about human habits, predicted a Berkeley transportation expert, automated vehicles could lead us to waste more gas and cause more congestion instead of leading to a traffic and accident-free utopia on the road. That Berkeley expert, professor Joan Walker, highlighted the example of “zero-occupancy” vehicles that could be clogging up residential streets as people summon them for on-demand home deliveries. One of the biggest problems in America’s transportation system is that the vast majority of trips are taken by people who are a driving an otherwise empty car, which sits dormant in their driveway 95% of the time. Many experts have touted the onset of self-driving cars is a chance to rethink that relationship and share fewer assets, easing traffic and lessening the need for parking spots. But Walker argued that people might also call for a self-driving car with all the environmental consideration they give to ordering their fifth package of the week on Amazon Prime. “To get to the future reality that we want will take not only automation,” said Walker, “but also requires behavior change.” Conversations about self-driving cars have a tendency to drift into scintillating hypotheticals, whether someone is imagining just how many lives could be saved on the road if we took human error out of the equation or mulling the ethics of an autonomous sedan deciding whether to save the life of a rider or several pedestrians on a tram. But the speeches at the conference on Tuesday, which bills itself as “the largest gathering … of professionals involved with making automated vehicles a reality,” often concentrated on more mundane, more immediate ones. Is it ethical to beta test self-driving cars on the road when most of the people using that road haven’t given their consent? How much advertising will be allowed in a self-driving car or along the route that car is programmed to take? As more cars get semi-autonomous features—like self-parking or self-braking—who is going to take responsibility for explaining to drivers how they work? In the coming years, as those features become more robust, how do we train humans to stay engaged instead of literally going to sleep at the wheel? Many speakers pointed to the past and present to make arguments about how humans should be approaching the onset of self-driving cars, but with different aims. X’s head of policy, Sarah Hunter, argued that laws have tended to come after innovation in transportation, suggesting that too many lawmakers have been authoring statutes rather than offering up their states as “test beds.” Others pointed to our current relationship with private vehicles, with all its inefficiency, as a tale of how things could go wrong or lead to disparities in society. And others, particularly J.D. Power and Associates’ Kristin Kolodge, made the case that there isn’t enough attention being paid to the building blocks of autonomous cars that are live right now. Kolodge presented research showing that drivers have resorted to “trial and error” in trying to figure out how to work features like adaptive cruise control (an increasingly common feature that uses sensors to keep the car at a set distance from the one in front of it, rather than at a set speed). Most of the people surveyed by J.D. Power said the dealer staff didn’t show them how such features worked. About half said their blind-spot monitors malfunctioned sometimes. Kolodge warned that the comfort and trust people have with these “assist” features will help determine how and when fully automated cars can “achieve serious volume.” Trust may have been top of mind for speakers in part because of the recent death of a Tesla driver; the role that autonomous technology may have played in the accident is under investigation by the federal government. Multiple speakers mentioned the incident, including Kolodge, as they emphasized how important the attitudes of human beings will be as new technology continues to roll out. “It’s extremely unfortunate the Tesla incident that happened,” she said. “This element of trust is extremely fragile.” Among those who came to address the audience with a message of prudence was U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We don’t want to replace crashes with human factors with large numbers of crashes caused by systems,” Foxx said. But “ready or not,” he added, “autonomous vehicles are coming.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4378108/driverless-car-study/"], "sentiment_score": 0.12272727272727278, "subjectivity_score": 0.45488305227111187},

First off, there’s no Kristen Stewart in this one, so tick that off the list. You don’t need to see it for the half-Game of Thrones, half-Middle Earth production design, an extravagant mingling of depressive forests and frosty, ice-migraine landscapes. You won’t be missing much if you forego the “I love you, I hate you, I love you” romance between career fairytale-gothic warriors Eric and Sara (Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain), who toss one another about brutally before succumbing to the dull inevitability of romance. You don’t even really need to see it for Nick Frost and Rob Brydon’s turn as randy, wisecracking dwarves, though you wonder if, given just a bit more latitude, they might have subverted the movie’s deadening squareness. No, there’s only one reason to see The Huntsman: Winter’s War: Gowns! Insane, off-the-hook gowns. Gowns trimmed with netting, grommets and spikes. Gowns with enormous winged, gilt-feathered collars, gowns that pour from the shoulder like liquid steel, gowns whose bodices look to have been made from pleated metal. Embroidery, chain mail, jewels, metallic paillettes: You name it, these gowns have it, further augmented by crowns as jagged as murder weapons, towering hairweaves that would make Marie Antoinette weep, and more dangly earrings than you’d find at three shopping mall’s worth of Claire’s. Did I mention the heavy-metal prosthetic talons?  These outlandish creations, courtesy of veteran costume designer Colleen Atwood, nearly upstage the actresses who wear them, Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt, who star as royal sisters dueling for power. (Chastain, because she’s a warrior, gets no gowns and instead must wear drab, practical forest-worthy leather jumpsuits.) The Huntsman: Winter’s War, tells the pre-Snow White backstory: Long before Snow came on the scene, Theron’s Queen Ravenna was using her wicked wiles to grab kingdoms by the handful. In an early scene, we see her playing a lethal game of chess with an aged king while wearing nothing but a tiara and a sequin-trimmed mini-robe. Clearly, he’s toast. Ravenna’s greed and ambition ultimately alienate her from her sweeter, more straight-shooting sister, Blunt’s Freya. After the quintessential betrayal, Freya turns into an ice queen who can freeze stuff with her eyes. She also has a mask of ice-feathers that turns her into an all-seeing, all-hearing owl, and she gets to ride a fearsome creature that looks like a cross between a polar bear and a tiger. I guess you’d call it a polar biger. All of that makes The Huntsman: Winter’s War sound like more fun than it is. Gowns aside, this thing’s a snooze: Events unfold tediously, and there are many scenes in which extras with dirty faces, playing demoralized townsfolk, mill about in a desultory fashion. In the end, this is your stock boring fairytale fable about the battle between good and evil, between the haves and the have-nots. No wonder Blunt and Theron’s gown-wearing sisters—definitely in the “have” camp—are the hands-down winners. Would you rather be them, or the actor playing Uncredited Yurt Villager? I rest my case.

The Thor actor may be one of America’s leading (and best looking) stars, but Hemsworth’s decision to move his family back to his native Australia was all a selfless intention to focus completely on raising children – and less on his career. “It’s no longer all about me, which is quite refreshing,” Hemsworth, 32, says in the latest issue of Modern Luxury. “Acting is the most self-absorbed world, where you are thinking about your feelings…You are constantly having to self-analyze or analyze a character you are playing, so you are internalizing and thinking, thinking, thinking about me… It’s just a horrible, noisy conversation. Once the kids arrived, I was like, ‘Wow, this is what life is about.'” Hemsworth is a father to three young children – India Rose, 3, and twins Tristan and Sasha, 2 – with his wife of six years Elsa Pataky, and living a fast-paced life in a large city, such as Los Angeles, is not the way he pictured raising a family. A post shared by Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) “L.A. is a tough place to get around with kids,” he says. “There’s not a whole lot of foot traffic. It was all about loading up the car and car seats. Here, we just walk out the door and head to the beach down the street. It’s a much more simple life.” He adds of living in Los Angeles, “We were living shoulder to shoulder in the suburbs and thought that’s not how we want our kids to grow up.

The Grey’s Anatomy actor and prominent Black Lives Matter activist evoked the name of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old fatally shot by a white police officer in Cleveland in 2014, and several other black people killed by police or while in police custody. “Yesterday would have been young Tamir Rice’s 14th birthday. So, I don’t want to hear anymore about how far we’ve come when paid public servants can pull a drive by on a 12-year-old playing alone in a park in broad daylight, killing him on television and then going home to make a sandwich,” Williams said. Williams, who received a standing ovation, dedicated the award to “real organizers all over the country,” including activists, civil rights attorneys, struggling parents and students. He also gave a specific shout-out to “the black women in particular who have spent their lifetimes dedicated to nurturing everyone before themselves.” “We can and will do better for you,” he told them. “Now, what we’ve been doing is looking at the data and we know that police somehow manage to deescalate, disarm and not kill white people every day,” Williams said. “So what’s going to happen is we’re going to have equal rights and justice in our own country or we will restructure their function in ours.” Williams also slammed critics of the Black Lives Matter movement. “If you have a critique for the resistance, for our resistance, then you better have an established record of critique of our oppression,” he said. “If you have no interest in equal rights for black people, then do not make suggestions to those who do. Sit down.” The speech was hailed by many, including superstar Justin Timberlake, on social media as powerful and inspirational. I forget this forum sometimes... I was truly inspired by @iJesseWilliams speech because I really do feel that we are all one...

Mark Dayton on Thursday said “this kind of racism exists” as he called for the U.S. Justice Department to investigate after the fatal police shooting of Philando Castile, adding that he doesn’t think the fatal shooting would “have happened if those passengers…were white.” The governor said he was “deeply offended” by the incident, in which he said race was a factor, after a police officer shot the 32-year-old black man dead during a traffic stop while his girlfriend and her daughter were in the car. “I’m heartbroken for Minnesota,” Dayton said at a news conference. “Justice will be served. Justice must be served if we’re going to have a chance to repair the terrible damage that has been done.” The governor said he was “forced to confront” the fact that “this kind of racism exists,” before suggesting that a white passenger would have been treated differently by police. “Would this have happened if those passengers, the driver and the passengers were white?” Dayton asked. “I don’t think it would have.” Dayton said that while facts still need to be surfaced, there’s “every indication” that the police officer’s decision to pull the trigger was “way in excess of what the situation called for.” Diamond Reynolds, the victim’s girlfriend who recorded video of the aftermath of the shooting, said their vehicle was pulled over for a “busted taillight.” The officer had asked Castile for his license and registration, she says. But when Castile reached for the information as requested and also informed the officer that he had a gun in the car and was licensed to carry, the officer opened fire, according to Reynolds. “My sense of outrage for what occurred is very real,” Dayton said. “Nobody should be shot and killed in Minnesota for a taillight being out of function.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4397086/minnesota-shooting-philando-castile-role-model-school/", "http://time.com/4396256/minnesota-shooting-philando-castile-what-know/", "http://time.com/4396585/philando-castile-police-shooting/"], "sentiment_score": -0.03440476190476191, "subjectivity_score": 0.3766666666666666},

Reynolds told reporters Thursday that her boyfriend was complying with the officer’s instructors to put his hands in the air and get his license and registration. She added that he told police that he had a gun in the car and a permit to carry it. Castile did “nothing but what the police officer asked of us,” she said. “Nothing within his body language said shoot me.” The shooting death shocked Edman, 62, who said Castile was a dutiful worker who adhered to rules strictly. “I’ve never seen anybody take that kind of role so seriously,” she said. “He followed directions carefully.” Castile graduated from Central High School in 2001 and had worked for Saint Paul Public Schools (SPPS) since he was 19 years old, beginning in 2002 in the Nutrition Services Department, the school district said in a statement. He was promoted to a supervisory position two years ago and was currently working at one of the schools during summer break. “I am deeply sorry for his family and for their loss.

The government’s transfer of surplus equipment came under scrutiny this summer following protests in Ferguson, Mo. following the shooting death of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. Obama ordered a review of the government’s programs in August after clashes between heavily-armed officers and both peaceful and violent protesters. The president is discussing those findings Monday afternoon in a Cabinet meeting, officials said, where he will order his aides to draft an executive order seeking to standardize procedures for the five government agencies that support local law enforcement acquisitions. But beyond calling for additional oversight, community engagement, and training, Obama will not act to curtail the transfer of military-style weapons and vehicles to local law enforcement, officials said, adding that wasn’t even the subject of their review. “Ultimately these were programs that were authorized by Congress, and so congressional intent is really at issue here,” one senior administration official told reporters before Obama’s announcement on the condition of anonymity. Obama will also announce a three-year $263 million package to increase the use of police body-worn cameras and expand local law enforcement training. The program, modeled after a similar program for bullet-proof vests for officers, would provide $75 million over three years for the “Body Worn Camera Partnership Program.” Administration officials said it would provided a 50 percent match for body-camera purchases by state and local agencies, enough for 50,000 new cameras. Officials said they hope to secure about $70 million in funding for the effort as part of a government funding deal that must be reached in the coming two weeks. The review of law enforcement acquisitions programs found “a lack of consistency in how federal programs are structured, implemented and audited,” the White House said. Obama’s order will direct the Departments of Defense, Treasury, Justice, and Homeland Security, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which all provide or support the acquisition of equipment, to work together to unify standards, including developing a consistent list of military-style equipment that can be purchased by local law enforcement. The White House said the agencies will consider whether to require civilian review and authorization of purchases of “controlled equipment”—like armored vehicles, weapons, and aircraft—before transfers are authorized, as well as whether to require specific training and use-of-force guidelines in place before those purchases are completed. Obama will order the agencies to develop their specific recommendations within 120 days after consultations with law enforcement, community, and civil rights stakeholders. Additionally, the administration is considering requiring the filing of after-action reports for federally-provided or -funded equipment involved in significant incidents. On a call with reporters, officials defended the Pentagon’s 1033 Program, which came under the most intensive scrutiny this summer as being a key vehicle by which local agencies are provided military surplus weapons and vehicles, saying 96 percent of the equipment transferred by the program doesn’t have military attributes, including surplus office supplies. It was unclear whether that figure was determined by the purchase price of the items, or just the raw figures of what was transferred. According to the Pentagon’s Law Enforcement Support Office, $450 million worth of property, by original purchase price, was transferred to local agencies in 2013. “We found that in many cases, these programs actually serve a very useful purpose,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. “And what is needed, however, is much greater consistency in oversight of these programs, primarily in how these programs are structured, how they’re implemented and then how the programs themselves are audited.” An official added that the White House has no opinion on congressional efforts to ban the transfer of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles and other military-style gear to law enforcement agencies. “We haven’t reviewed any specific legislation so I don’t have a specific position for you,” the official said. Obama is also announcing the intent to issue an executive order to create a Task Force On 21st Century Policing,chaired by Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey, and Laurie Robinson, professor at George Mason University and former Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Office of Justice Programs.

{"type": "article", "header": "How Kristen Stewart Shook Off ", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "update_date/publish_date": "April 9, 2015 10:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/3774243/kristen-stewart-clouds-of-sils-maria/", "text": "This Friday, Kristen Stewart’s newest film, Clouds of Sils Maria, opens in select U.S. cities. It’s a film that stretches Stewart’s formidable talents—placing her opposite Juliette Binoche, one of the foremost stars of world cinema—and one has already made waves internationally: For her role as a sly, knowing personal assistant to a diva-ish aging actress, she won an unofficial critics’ poll at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival and was mentioned as a potential Best Actress winner there (Julianne Moore ended up taking the prize). At year’s end, she became the first American actress ever to win the French version of the Oscar. How did this happen to an actress still best known as Bella Swan? Between 2008 and 2012, Stewart appeared in five Twilight films, rising to megafame for playing a role more catalyst than character. Bella existed to be the pivot point of a love triangle, and the Twilight films demanded little of Stewart but her willingness to bite her lip pensively. (Offscreen, the demands were perhaps higher—she had to participate in a relentless publicity circuit.) The role was star-making, but Stewart seemed not to want to be the sort of star who did a lengthy press junket a year. She came in for frequent and harsh criticism online, as her discomfort with endless press obligations, and with fans who adored her boyfriend/co-star Robert Pattinson, sometimes transmitted as ingratitude for the opportunities Twilight that afforded her. She’s answered those criticisms, now, elegantly, by bringing her stardom to offbeat productions. What better way to show that she was grateful for Twilight than to use the stardom it gave her to help bring attention to the masterful Clouds? The film, directed by French auteur Olivier Assayas, places its two lead actresses in a claustrophobically close relationship, wringing tension from the differences in outlook between Binoche’s neurotic perfectionism and Stewart’s more pragmatic sense of what makes contemporary Hollywood tick. Stewart, who is in her real life admirably frank about the obligations of working in movies, brings to the screen a puncturing awareness of Binoche’s delusions. The character is unmistakably a Stewart creation: Clear-eyed, unconcerned with what others think of her. But the viewer could be forgiven for surprise that Stewart, still young and burdened with a certain reputation, manages to go toe-to-toe with one of the world’s great actresses. But that surprise shouldn’t last much longer. Stewart’s recent creative success is hardly limited to Clouds: In the recent Oscar-winner Still Alice, playing a daughter whose toughness concealed a flawed relationship with her parents and deep fears for the future, Stewart did what the greatest stars do. She used aspects of her public image (in her case, a quintessentially millennial surliness) to create a character who felt as though she might walk off the screen at any moment. The movie was flawed, but Stewart transcended thin material, something she hadn’t been able to do in the past. That’s because in Twilight and in the would-be franchise film Snow White and the Huntsman, she seemed so focused on just getting through the film alive that she was uncomfortable playing against her own persona. Stewart’s history in the public eye is now an asset she deploys artfully, as when her Clouds character deflates her employer’s fantasies about young Hollywood. It’s not labored or overwrought, somehow—it’s just proof of Stewart’s underheralded powers. Stewart can’t seem to change the conversation around her: Recent coverage of the actress in the run-up to her film’s release have included what she thinks about Pattinson’s engagement (she’s doing okay!) and what she thinks of the celebrity-gossip industry (she’s against it!). Because of the manner in which she came to prominence, Stewart will always have people who are more interested in her fame than her work, both zealous friends and detractors. (And she may find that it would be better not to acknowledge the tabloid press at all, rather than validating it with constant mentions in interviews.) But by choosing roles in which she’s able to spin variations on an edgy young woman with deep, almost scarily intense passions, Stewart is making the absolute most of her fame. More young stars should be as savvy, and as willing to tempt the haters, as is Stewart in her pursuit of new shades and dimensions of Bella Swan-ish angst. She’s doing the same thing as Jennifer Lawrence, who finds roles in which she’s able to be outspoken and relatable. In temperament, Lawrence is Stewart’s opposite. Yet their talents are comparable, and Stewart is making her mark by creating work out of the uncomfortable, strange world of modern fame.

Holder made televised remarks from a lectern in Washington, D.C., as protestors began to gather and march at several locations around New York City in response to the grand jury’s decision in the case of Eric Garner. Federal prosecutors would conduct a “independent, thorough, fair and expeditious investigation” into Garner’s death, Holder said, after acknowledging he informed Garner’s widow that the Justice Department would launch the inquiry. “His death was a great tragedy,” he added. “All lives must be valued, all lives.” MORE: Behind the Video of Eric Garner’s Deadly Confrontation With New York Police A city medical examiner had previously ruled Garner’s death a homicide caused by “compression of the neck (chokehold)” and chest compressions he incurred while being subdued by police on July 17. Officers on Staten Island accused Garner of selling untaxed cigarettes and had attempted to arrest him, which he protested. Footage of the altercation, shot by a friend, shows a group of policemen forcing Garner to the ground as one of them, officer Daniel Panteleo, appears to put Garner in a chokehold, which is banned by the city’s police department. Holder appealed for calm Wednesday as protestors gathered in New York and Washington in response to the announcement. The news came about a week after a grand jury in Ferguson, Mo., decided not to indict white officer Darren Wilson in the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. The Justice Department is also investigating that case. The Attorney General also began a series of conversations in communities across the country between police officers and minorities to improve relations between the two groups. Holder said such conversations would proceed “as we seek to form trust and foster understanding.”  Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3016326/eric-garner-video-police-chokehold-death/"], "sentiment_score": 0.14633838383838382, "subjectivity_score": 0.47471590909090916},

While still years from being widely adopted, driverless cars are increasingly capable of handling a wide variety of driving conditions. With the basic technical hurdles out of the way, driverless car experts now face a different set of problems — namely, ethical issues. Among the most pressing questions: What should a driverless car do if it faces a choice between putting its passengers at risk or harming someone outside the vehicle? New research reveals that people are conflicted about such a dilemma. In six online surveys conducted last year, Jean-François Bonnefon, a psychologist at France’s University of Toulouse, asked U.S. residents how they would prefer their autonomous vehicles to behave. The results, to be published in the June 24 issue of the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s journal Science, found that most respondents believe self-driving cars should be programmed to save as many lives as possible in a given situation. However, these same people would prefer to buy a car that protects themselves and other passengers inside the vehicle as a priority. For a carmaker seeking to sell autonomous cars to a skeptical public, that seemingly contradictory result might be maddening. “It’s really a question of our society coming to some kind of consensus about what we want these autonomous machines to be like, and then car manufacturers finding a way to produce something that’s consistent with those expectations,” says Joshua D. Greene, a psychology professor at Harvard University. Greene has authored a separate article on the self-driving dilemma that will appear alongside Bonnefon’s work. Participants in the study were also asked whether they would buy a self-driving car if there was a government imposed regulation that forced these vehicles to prioritize minimizing overall casualties over the passenger’s own safety. Many respondents lost interest in purchasing an autonomous vehicle under these conditions. But Bonnefon thinks this may change in the future. “At the moment, it seems the idea of sacrificing yourself is a big hurdle in peoples’ minds,” says Bonnefon. “But people may come to realize that it is much safer to let the car drive rather than to drive yourself, and that terrifying prospect of being sacrificed by your car is very unlikely compared to the other safety benefits.” Indeed, self-driving cars could potentially prevent 90% of traffic accidents in the U.S., in addition to cutting down commute times and increasing available parking spaces, McKinsey & Co. found last year. For Greene, driverless cars are all but inevitable. What remains to be seen is how people will react to them. “The question is, will they be adopted in spite of significant misgivings about how they handle emergency situations, or will they be adopted in a way which the general public is quite comfortable with?,” said Greene. “But I think that they are coming one way or another because the technology is just so useful.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.0827715934858792, "subjectivity_score": 0.4420428777571633},

Loehmann fired the shots that killed Rice, and Garmback was his partner. “Given this perfect storm of human error, mistakes and miscommunications by all involved that day, the evidence did not indicate criminal conduct by police,” McGinty said. Rice was shot on Nov. 22, 2014, while playing with a toy gun. McGinty said a recent enhancement of the security video of the shooting shows that Rice was in fact pulling the pellet gun from his waistband as the officers approached. Rice likely “either intended to hand it over to the officers or show them it wasn’t a real gun,” McGinty said. “But there was no way for the officers to know that.” The grand jury that made the decision had been meeting since mid-October. The burden of proof for an indictment is much lower than the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in criminal trials; for an indictment, the grand jury needs only determine that a crime might have been committed. “The outcome will not cheer anyone, nor should it,” McGinty said of the lack of indictment, speaking of the Rice family’s loss. McGinty said he had already told Rice’s mother of the decision, calling it a “tough conversation.” The Rice family attorneys issued a statement shortly after the press conference condemning the decision, the Washington Post reports. “It has been clear for months now that Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty was abusing and manipulating the grand jury process to orchestrate a vote against indictment,” the Rice family attorneys said. “Even though video shows the police shooting Tamir in less than one second, Prosecutor McGinty hired so-called expert witnesses to try to exonerate the officers and tell the grand jury their conduct was reasonable and justified. It is unheard of, and highly improper, for a prosecutor to hire “experts” to try to exonerate the targets of a grand jury investigation.” Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican candidate in the 2016 presidential race, also put out a statement, urging people to continue moving forward from the tragedy: My statement on the Tamir Rice case. -John pic.twitter.com/knP9ww4mzx At Monday’s press conference, McGinty called for reforms including dashboard cameras on all police cruisers and body cameras on all officers, and said makers of toy guns should differentiate them more from real weapons.

I need justice. And even after justice, this will never go away.” Reynolds says in the video that the vehicle was pulled over for a “busted taillight.” The officer asked Castile for his license and registration, she says.

Supporters of Alton Sterling, who was killed early Tuesday while police apparently pinned him down outside a convenience store, called for the police chief to be fired or resign and urged residents to boycott the local mall after the fatal shooting. “I, for one, will not rest or not allow him to be swept in the dirt,” said Quinyetta McMillon, 31, the mother of Sterling’s 15-year-old son. The teenager, Cameron Sterling, sobbed loudly and was overcome with emotion as his mother spoke at a news conference. Sterling’s death, which sparked protests in Baton Rouge, was caught in a graphic video, which was widely shared on social media. The footage appears to show two officers approaching Sterling outside of a convenience store. One officer appears to tackle him over the hood of the car, then both pounce on him, apparently to restrain him on the pavement. “As this video has been shared across the world, you will see with your own eyes how he was handled unjustly and killed without regard for the lives that he helped raise,” McMillon, who is not married to Sterling, told reporters. “As a mother, I have now been forced to raise a son who is going to remember what happened to his father that I can’t take away from him,” she added. “He is at an age of understanding. I hurt more for him and his loss.” McMillon wept as she said the greatest failure as a parent is “to see your child hurt and know there’s nothing you can do about it.” Michael McClanahan, head of the NAACP in Baton Rouge, called for Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. to be fired. “He must step down. We cannot have anybody who allows this type of action to take place,” he said. Dabadie said at a news conference that he would not resign and said those who are asking for him to step down from his post were “acting off emotion.” “I’m not retiring. I’m not resigning,” he added later. “I don’t think it’s fair for people to act out of emotion. We have done a lot of good in this community. We’re working diligently to bring the truth out.” Abdul Rashid Muhammad, who leads the local chapter of the Nation of Islam, urged supporters to boycott the Louisiana mall, starting Friday “until we get justice.” “Let’s withhold our money,” he said. “Don’t spend anything.” Sandra Sterling, the aunt of the slain man who raised him, said she was grateful for the unknown bystander who recorded the video but that she was “very disturbed” and “hurt” at what she saw in the footage. “It’s a horrible thing to happen to him,” she told reporters Wednesday. “He didn’t deserve that.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4394411/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-shooting/", "http://time.com/4395056/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-police-chief/"], "sentiment_score": 0.029493464052287567, "subjectivity_score": 0.32957516339869275},

The President had addressed the shooting in a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday, but went into greater detail during his spoken address. The President laid out a list of statistics that suggest black and Latino Americans are disproportionately affected by the criminal-justice system than their white counterparts — even when situations are similar but for the color of their skin. Blacks, Obama said, are 30 % more likely than whites to be pulled over, and blacks and Latinos are three times more likely to be searched. They are also arrested at higher rates than whites, have a higher chance of being involved in a deadly encounter with law enforcement, and face longer sentences for comparable crimes. “These are facts,” Obama said. “When incidents like this occur, there’s a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if because of the color of their skin they are not being treated the same. That hurts and that should trouble all of us.” “This is not just a black issue,” the President added. “This is not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about. It’s incumbent on all of us to say we can do better than this. We are better than this.” This isn’t the first time the President has addressed a deadly incident between law-enforcement officials and black Americans. In the wake of the shooting of Michael Brown in Missouri and the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York, the President launched the Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which produced a set of recommendations meant to help prevent police killings and improve police-community relations. The President also took time to acknowledge the work of law-enforcement officials around the country, who he said often have to make split-second decisions in the line of duty. They too, Obama said, deserve to go home to their families. But the President also addressed a critique he has faced in the wake of such incidents: that because he takes special time out to address cases where police kill civilians rather, he is neglecting police fatalities and striking an anti-law enforcement stance. “To all of law enforcement I want to be very clear, we know you have a tough job,” Obama added, saying Americans also “mourn those in uniform who are protecting us who lose their lives.” “When people say black lives matter, that doesn’t mean that blue lives don’t matter,” the President continued. “All lives matter, but the data shows that black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents.” “We should care about that.

Castile, who was known by friends as Phil, was a cafeteria supervisor at J.J. Hill Montessori Magnet School in Saint Paul, Minn., where he memorized the names of the 500 children he served every day — along with their food allergies, his former coworker said. “He remembered their names. He remembered who couldn’t have milk. He knew what they could have to eat and what they couldn’t,” Joan Edman, a recently retired paraprofessional at the school, told TIME. “This was a real guy. He made a real contribution. Yes, black lives matter. But this man mattered.” A police officer shot Castile, 32, late Wednesday during a traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights, authorities said. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, captured the aftermath of the incident on video and streamed it on Facebook Live, where it went viral. Reynolds told reporters Thursday that her boyfriend was complying with the officer’s instructors to put his hands in the air and get his license and registration. She added that he told police that he had a gun in the car and a permit to carry it. Castile did “nothing but what the police officer asked of us,” she said. “Nothing within his body language said shoot me.” The shooting death shocked Edman, 62, who said Castile was a dutiful worker who adhered to rules strictly. “I’ve never seen anybody take that kind of role so seriously,” she said. “He followed directions carefully.” Castile graduated from Central High School in 2001 and had worked for Saint Paul Public Schools (SPPS) since he was 19 years old, beginning in 2002 in the Nutrition Services Department, the school district said in a statement. He was promoted to a supervisory position two years ago and was currently working at one of the schools during summer break. “I am deeply sorry for his family and for their loss. He’s worked in SPPS for many years and he graduated from our district, so he was one of our own,” SPPS Superintendent Valeria Silva said in the statement. Parents, several of whom rallied for justice outside the tight-knit school Thursday, said they felt safe knowing Castile was in charge of their children’s food and said Castile transformed the cafeteria into a positive and cheerful space. “He was a fixture. I was always happy to see him around school. The cafeteria was a pretty happy place. He was part of the community and an important one,” Andrew Karre, whose 8-year-old son attends J.J. Hill, told TIME. “He was just a nice, caring person who worked at the school, who should not be dead,” said Karre, 37.

Cops fed him four bullets. #Blacklivesmatter\" pic.twitter.com/YXhkXPKQyL In the school district’s statement, an unnamed coworker says Castile was smart and “overqualified” for his position, yet still took his job seriously. “Kids loved him. He was quiet, respectful and kind. I knew him as warm and funny,” the colleague said. “He wore a shirt and tie to his supervisor interview and said his goal was to one day ‘sit on the other side of this table.’” Edman said Castile may have worked inside a kitchen, but he often taught children important lessons in the consequences of stealing and being respectful. “He was much a teacher than any teacher in that building,” Edman said. “We had a calmer cafeteria this year, and I think it was because he was there.” Castile was someone who “has that presence that people respect and they become more respectful too,” Edman said. “I think he did that for kids,” she said. “Kids watch everything, and they saw that. He had so much going for him. He didn’t have an axe to grind. It just doesn’t make sense. This is a real person.

But the President also addressed a critique he has faced in the wake of such incidents: that because he takes special time out to address cases where police kill civilians rather, he is neglecting police fatalities and striking an anti-law enforcement stance. “To all of law enforcement I want to be very clear, we know you have a tough job,” Obama added, saying Americans also “mourn those in uniform who are protecting us who lose their lives.” “When people say black lives matter, that doesn’t mean that blue lives don’t matter,” the President continued. “All lives matter, but the data shows that black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents.” “We should care about that. We can’t dismiss it,” Obama said.   Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4396635/minnesota-shooting-philando-castile-video-police-response/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4394664/alton-sterling-family-baton-rouge-police-shooting/?iid=sr-link2", "http://time.com/4396256/minnesota-shooting-philando-castile-what-know/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4397248/minnesota-gov-mark-dayton-philando-castile-shooting/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4397070/president-obama-alton-sterling-philando-castile-shootings-statement/?xid=homepage"], "sentiment_score": 0.04240937247034808, "subjectivity_score": 0.46756440713757796},

The video opens with Diamond Reynolds (identified as Lavish Reynolds on her Facebook page) showing Castile bloodied and in the driver’s seat, with the police officer’s gun visible through the window next to him. Reynolds, whose daughter was in the backseat of the car, says on the video that the officer had asked Castile for his license and registration, and as Castile reached for the information and told the officer that he had a legally permitted gun in his car, the officer shot him “four to five times.” Read the transcript of the Facebook Live video here: Diamond Reynolds: Stay with me [inaudible yelling in background], We got pulled over for a busted tail light in the back and the police just, he … he’s, he’s covered [inaudible yelling in background], they killed my boyfriend.

Mark Dayton on Thursday said “this kind of racism exists” as he called for the U.S. Justice Department to investigate after the fatal police shooting of Philando Castile, adding that he doesn’t think the fatal shooting would “have happened if those passengers…were white.” The governor said he was “deeply offended” by the incident, in which he said race was a factor, after a police officer shot the 32-year-old black man dead during a traffic stop while his girlfriend and her daughter were in the car. “I’m heartbroken for Minnesota,” Dayton said at a news conference. “Justice will be served. Justice must be served if we’re going to have a chance to repair the terrible damage that has been done.” The governor said he was “forced to confront” the fact that “this kind of racism exists,” before suggesting that a white passenger would have been treated differently by police. “Would this have happened if those passengers, the driver and the passengers were white?” Dayton asked. “I don’t think it would have.” Dayton said that while facts still need to be surfaced, there’s “every indication” that the police officer’s decision to pull the trigger was “way in excess of what the situation called for.” Diamond Reynolds, the victim’s girlfriend who recorded video of the aftermath of the shooting, said their vehicle was pulled over for a “busted taillight.” The officer had asked Castile for his license and registration, she says. But when Castile reached for the information as requested and also informed the officer that he had a gun in the car and was licensed to carry, the officer opened fire, according to Reynolds. “My sense of outrage for what occurred is very real,” Dayton said. “Nobody should be shot and killed in Minnesota for a taillight being out of function.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4397086/minnesota-shooting-philando-castile-role-model-school/", "http://time.com/4396256/minnesota-shooting-philando-castile-what-know/", "http://time.com/4396585/philando-castile-police-shooting/"], "sentiment_score": -0.03440476190476191, "subjectivity_score": 0.3766666666666666},

Sterling, 37, was shot dead while police apparently pinned him down outside a convenience store. The incident was caught on video and prompted calls for boycotts of the local mall and for the police chief to be fired or resign. Baton Rouge Police said two officers responded to a disturbance call outside the store about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday. A caller told a dispatcher that a black man in a red shirt who was selling CDs had threatened him with a gun. “An altercation between Sterling and the officers ensued. Sterling was shot during the altercation and died at the scene,” the police department said in a statement. The two officers have been placed on administrative leave.

Two civilians were also wounded in the Dallas shooting. The gunman—who officials say acted alone—opened fire on officers from an “elevated position.” He was later killed by a police explosive after a standoff with law enforcement officers. The shooting now ranks as the deadliest targeted attack on U.S. police officers in nearly 100 years and the deadliest day for law enforcement since the 9/11 terror attacks, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Details have emerged throughout the day, as the investigation developed. Here’s what’s important to know: The incident began with an “ambush” on officers The first shots rang out around 8:45 p.m. on Thursday near a street in downtown Dallas where protesters were marching and police were engaged in crowd-and-traffic control. A total of 12 officers were injured in the ensuing gunfight. At a press conference on Friday morning, Dallas Police Chief David Brown described the incident as an “ambush” on officers. Carlos Harris, a local resident who witnessed the incident, told the Dallas Morning News that the attack seemed “strategic.” “It was tap tap pause. Tap tap pause,” he said. As the investigation continues, parts of the downtown area will remain closed to the public until Wednesday, police said. The gunman was killed by a police explosive The suspect, who died after a standoff with police at a downtown parking garage, told negotiators he was upset about the recent police shootings as well as the Black Lives Matter movement. He also told negotiators that “the end is coming” and that he planned to “hurt and kill” more members of law enforcement. Officials identified the suspect as 25-year-old Micah Johnson, an Army veteran. He had completed a tour in Afghanistan, serving in the Army from March 2009 to April 2015, according to the AP. “The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” Brown said during a morning press conference. “He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.” Johnson, who was killed by a police bomb robot, told police he was not affiliated with any groups. While Brown initially said three suspects had been arrested, officials at a press conference on Friday evening said it now appears Johnson acted alone. “As we’ve started to unravel this fishing knot, we realized that the shooting came from one building at different levels from this suspect,” Rawlings said. Officials said the explosive became their only option after negotiations broke down. “We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was,” Brown said. “Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger.” These are the five victims  Officials identified the victims as Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) officer Brent Thompson and Dallas Police Department officers Patrick Zamarripa, Michael Krol, Lorne Ahrens and Michael Smith. Friends and families are mourning the victims—a group that included veterans, a newlywed and several fathers. Laura Zamarripa, Patrick’s older sister, remembered her brother in an interview with TIME as a caring force in her life and a good father. “He just had a constant smile on his face after he became a father,” she said. Read more about the victims here. The shooting comes amid a heated debate over the role of law enforcement in communities Thursday’s shooting could further polarize a heated national debate about race and law enforcement following the deaths of Philando Castile in St. Paul, Minn., and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La. — both black men who were shot by police officers within a day of each other. The protest in Dallas was one of multiple demonstrations that took place across the country against the two police shootings, with hundreds of people taking to the streets in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and other cities. Aside from the families of the two victims, activists, celebrities and politicians have spoken out against the deaths of Sterling and Castile. U.S. leaders have condemned the violence In a speech from Warsaw, where he is currently attending the NATO Summit, President Barack Obama called the mass shooting a “vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement” and said there is “no possible justification” for violence against police. At a press conference on Friday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch characterized the incident as an “unfathomable tragedy.” “To all Americans, I ask you, I implore you, do not let this week precipitate a new normal in this country,” she said. “I ask you to turn to each other, not against each other, as we move forward. Let us support one another. Let us help heal one another. I urge you to remember today and every day, we are one nation, we are one people and we stand together.

Lynch said the Justice Department is working closely with officials in Dallas in the wake of Thursday night’s attack. The Attorney General also noted the civil rights investigation that has been opened into the police shooting of Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Because of the ongoing investigations into the Sterling case and the Dallas shooting, Lynch did not address the details of either case. Instead, she emphasized the impact of the shootings on the nation, calling on Americans to confront the tragedies not with violence, but with peaceful action. “After the events of this week, Americans across our country are feeling a sense of helplessness,” she said. “The answer must not be violence. The answer is never violence.” Given that the shooting of Dallas police officers took place during a protest against police shootings in other states, Lynch also asked that future protesters not be discouraged. “To those who seek to improve our country through peaceful protest and protected speech, your voice is important,” she said. “Do not be discourage by those who would use your lawful actions as a cover for their harmful acts.” Lynch also said it was time to consider the “ease with which wrongdoers can get their hands on deadly weapons.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4395459/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-police-shooting/?iid=sr-link2", "http://time.com/4397086/minnesota-shooting-philando-castile-role-model-school/?iid=sr-link1"], "sentiment_score": -0.06726190476190474, "subjectivity_score": 0.44285714285714295},

Jump to the beginning of 2013, when Playstation formed Magic Lab: a special R&D arm at PlayStation tasked with dreaming up the next generation of gaming experiences. “We had the concept in 2012 for this group which would use technology to really explore new experiences,” said Richard Marks, Director of PlayStation’s Magic Lab. “We really focused a lot on technology in the past, and [now] we really want to focus more on the new experiences that technology enables. One of the things that we believe strongly in is actually prototyping things; we call it: experiencing engineering.” Since joining Sony, Richard Marks has been responsible for the development of Sony’s PlayStation Eye, PlayStation Move controllers and now Sony’s foray into virtual reality: Project Morpheus, a wraparound headset designed to work with the company’s PlayStation 4 games console. The headset’s revelation came in tandem with Facebook’s high-stakes maneuver to put virtual reality on the map for non-gamers per its recent $2 billion acquisition of Oculus Rift. So far, Sony’s touted Morpheus to game designers at shows like the Game Developers Conference and E3 to drum up development interest (though the technology’s still far from a commercial product — it currently has no release date). Morpheus’ display still has a few issues, too: there’s a stutter effect on some demonstrations caused by high latency, and Morpheus’ Field of View (FOV) doesn’t cover everyone’s vision completely. The technology also has various critics predicting that it lacks a mass market appeal. But then again Morpheus is only a prototype, as are the various Oculus Rift iterations. “There’s a trade-off. There’s a fixed amount of resolution. So you can either give that to a really wide field of view or you can make [the resolution] feel higher, but the [field of view] narrower. We’re trying to get a good balance of that. Right now we’re still working on the issue of the display. Right now we have a great prototype system for our developers … [but] for the commercial system, we’re still working on that.” And as a prototype, Project Morpheus is an amazing portal into what VR could look like for the future. The technology is so electrifying that creators and entrepreneurs outside the games industry are seeing VR’s potential, which is why Facebook put up the cash in the first place. For instance, currently Sir David Attenborough is creating a VR nature documentary, companies are looking into how VR can impact education and Hollywood is looking into virtual reality movies. Whether VR will succeed as a mass market product or not remains to be seen; in the meantime, PlayStation’s Magic Lab is tinkering with its notion of what the future of gaming might look like. During the launch of the PlayStation 4 in November 2013, Marks and fellow Magic Lab researcher Eric Larsen were demoing their eye tracking or “gaze tracking” technology. “A lot of different people are looking at how to track your eyes. Our focus is more on, if you can track your eyes, what do you do with it?” Marks said. The technology has a lot of potential applications, like as a targeting assistant for shooter games, as Marks and Larsen demonstrated with the game Infamous: Second Son. One of the more interesting applications Marks noted is the ability to pick up on subtle, non-verbal communication cues. “Where someone is looking conveys a lot of information about what the person is interested in, what they intend to do, and it’s a very unconscious thing that people do,” Larsen said. In the demonstration, the player interacts with a computer store merchant who’s trying to sell the player different products. The eye gazing technology detects what products the player is looking at and uses that information to decide what products to pitch the player. “You can make the characters smarter because they kind of react in a way that is more intelligent because they know what you’re looking at,” Marks adds. On top of that, Magic Lab is also looking into biometrics, partnering with UC San Francisco to research brain waves as a feedback mechanism for how a game affects players. Magic Lab, like Google X — responsible for the creation of Google Glass and Google’s Driverless Car — seems to be Sony’s take on “experiencing engineering” without the red-tape. Whether Magic Lab will create products with the same hype factor as Google X’s ideas is anyone’s guess, but if Morpheus is any indication, Marks and his team are off to a promising start.

HTC says the Vive has the “most immersive experience of any VR package,” thanks to a full 360-degree field of vision and 90-frame-per-second video capabilities. The company is also working on wireless controllers for the headset, which, given the Valve partnership, will probably be marketed primarily as a gaming device—games like shooters are a natural fit for the VR experience, and the Vive will be compatible with Valve’s SteamVR virtual-reality platform. Still, games won’t be the only offering on HTC and Valve’s Vive headset. HTC is partnering with several content providers, including HBO, Lionsgate and Google, for other virtual-reality content like movies.

Now, a report from Bloomberg sheds light on the financial reality that led to Kalanick’s unexpected decision. The San Francisco-based Uber lost more than $750 million in the second quarter of 2016, according to the report, building on losses of about $520 million in the previous quarter. (As a private company, Uber does not publicly release financial information, but it does hold quarterly calls with investors to keep them updated.) Where was all that money going? Drivers. Nearly anywhere there’s Uber, there’s at least one Uber rival looking to steal away market share. (Lyft and others in the U.S., Ola in India, and, until recently, Didi in China.) That competition creates a price war, wherein the rideshare companies offer cheaper fares to passengers and pay drivers to make up the difference. A source familiar with the situation tells TIME that a majority of the second quarter’s loss was spent on subsidizing drivers in China. That Uber has left China should mean fewer losses in the months to come. Still, the company has long showed a willingness to spend boatloads of money to preserve market share. Indeed, Bloomberg reports that Uber lost $100 million in the second quarter in the U.S., where it was previously profitable, as it fights smaller rivals like Lyft. Of course, the spend-and-grow tactic can only last so long as you’ve got money in the bank. Uber’s got plenty — $8 billion plus another $1 billion from the Didi deal on the way, per Bloomberg — but it will eventually have to start making money. (Uber’s experiments with autonomous vehicles, which could reduce its reliance on human labor, could help.) The company’s gambit is that it can keep spending until its rivals fold, or at least settle for distant second, third and so on. Given that Lyft is reportedly looking to sell itself with little success (and losing more money than Uber, per Bloomberg), the strategy could be paying off.

Police identified the gunman as 25-year-old Micah Johnson and said he was an Army veteran with no criminal history. He completed a tour in Afghanistan, serving in the Army from March 2009 to April 2015, according to the Associated Press. “Others have identified him as a loner,” police said in a statement. Dallas Police Chief David Brown said Johnson—who told police he was not affiliated with any groups—was killed in a standoff with law enforcement in a parking garage during the early hours of Friday morning. Brown said Johnson told police he was upset with police shootings and wanted to kill white officers. The Dallas shooting began during a protest over police brutality, following the deaths of two black men by police officers in separate incidents this week. “The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” Brown said during a press conference Friday morning. “He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.” Johnson was killed by a police bomb robot after the lengthy standoff. “We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was,” Brown said. “Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger. The suspect is deceased as a result of detonating the bomb.” Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said Johnson had threatened to use bombs. At a press conference on Friday night, Rawlings said officials gave Johnson “plenty of options” for surrender before they used the robotic explosive. “As it concerns the cowardice, it seems as if the sole suspect now has received his justice, and what will be important is to ensure that there are no other potential co-conspirators with this particular assailant,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at the same press conference. While Brown initially said that three suspects, including a woman, had been taken into custody by Dallas police, state and federal officials said on Friday evening that it now appears Johnson acted alone. “As we’ve started to unravel this fishing knot, we realized that the shooting came from one building at different levels from this suspect,” Rawlings said. Police said that during a search of Johnson’s home, detectives found bomb making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition, and a personal journal of combat tactics, which they are still reviewing. In addition to the 12 officers, two civilians were injured in the shooting, which President Barack Obama called a “vicious, calculated and despicable attack.” Write to Tessa Berenson Rogers at tessa.Rogers@time.com and Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4397785/dallas-shooting-police-protest-snipers/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4398698/dallas-shooting-police-chief-david-brown/", "http://time.com/4398034/dallas-shooting-suspect-white-officers/", "http://time.com/4396220/philando-castile-minnesota-shooting/", "http://time.com/4398196/dallas-shooting-bomb-robot/", "http://time.com/4399164/dallas-shooting-mayor-mike-rawlings-prayer-vigil/", "http://time.com/4398685/dallas-shooting-gov-greg-abbott-open-letter/", "http://time.com/4397906/president-barack-obama-sniper-dallas-shootings"], "sentiment_score": -0.047126436781609195, "subjectivity_score": 0.28965517241379307},

A female passenger streamed the aftermath of the incident on Facebook Live showing Philando Castile, 32, bloodied in the driver’s seat and a police officer with his gun still visible through the window. The woman’s daughter sits in the backseat of the car. In the video, the woman, Diamond Reynolds, says the officer asked Castile for his license and registration. Castile reached for the information as requested and also informed the officer that he had a gun in the car and was licensed to carry, the woman says. “I told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hands up,” the officer says in the graphic and expletive-laced video. “Please, officer, don’t tell me that you just did this to him,” the woman says in the video. “You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir.” The video continues as Reynolds and her daughter are detained and transported in the back of a police car. “It’s OK,” the daughter tells her mother. “I’m right here with you.” The shooting occurred around 9 p.m. in Falcon Heights, a St. Paul suburb, and Castile was declared dead at a nearby hospital less than an hour later, according to the Star Tribune.   The video—now viewed more than 2 million times on Facebook—gained immediate traction online over night. Protesters gathered in front of the governor’s residence in Madison shouting “no justice, no peace.” An investigation into the shooting by the St. Anthony Police officer is being led by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The department’s interim chief said he few details about the incident, according to the Associated Press. The incident occurred as outrage continues in Louisiana over a video of a black man being shot repeatedly by police. In that video, the man—identified as Alton Sterling—had already been apprehended and appeared to be lying prostrate on the ground when an officer opened fire at point blank range. The U.S. Department of Justice is leading the investigation in that case.

In a video capturing that aftermath, which was posted to Facebook Live by Castile’s girlfriend and has been viewed more than 3 million times, Castile is seen barely moving in the passenger seat of a car with blood across his chest as a St. Anthony Police Department officer points a weapon at him. The first minute and 30 seconds of the video shows Castile lying virtually motionless in the car, with no one administering aid. Diamond Reynolds, Castile’s girlfriend who streamed the video, subsequently told reporters that the police left her boyfriend “sitting in the car after they shot him. Nobody checking his pulse, nothing. The police officer that shot him was still standing there … with his gun still drawn after he was shot.” Another video taken by a bystander later appears to show several officers administering CPR to Castile outside of the vehicle where he was shot. While the footage is a narrow slice of the events surrounding Castile’s death, law enforcement experts say that the officers initially appeared uncertain over whether Castile posed a threat even after he was shot. “In general, you have a two-step process after use of force: Secure the scene, then render aid,” says Seth Stoughton, a University of South Carolina law professor who studies law enforcement. “Maybe that’s handcuffing the subject, kicking a knife away, or moving a firearm away from a subject. As soon as a scene is stabilized, officers have to start rendering aid.” Police, however, aren’t obligated to actually give aid themselves, though regulations vary from department to department. They are only bound to render aid, which could mean calling in EMS services. “It can look very callous if they don’t immediately render aid to someone shot in the chest,” says David Harris, a University of Pittsburgh law professor who researches police behavior. “But they’re often not medically trained to do that.” Read more: Mother of Minnesota Man Killed by Police: ‘He Was Black in the Wrong Place’ The problem for officers, says Jon Shane, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, is that officers don’t know if a person is armed and potentially momentarily stunned. “From his point of view, he’s still facing a threat,” Shane says, adding that’s also why others on the scene may also be temporarily detained. Reynolds, Castile’s girlfriend who shot the video, was also briefly handcuffed. “She’s an accessory to what’s going on until they can confirm or deny whether a crime has been committed,” Shane says. Castile and Reynolds were stopped in Falcon Heights, Minn., a suburb of St. Paul, for a broken taillight, according to Reynolds. In the video, Reynolds says Castile is licensed to carry a weapon and later told reporters that Castile told the arresting officers that he was carrying a firearm. Reynolds says that Castile was reaching for his wallet to show the officer his ID when he was shot. The St. Anthony Police Department referred questions about Castile’s death to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The victims include Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) officer Brent Thompson and Dallas Police Department officers Patrick Zamarripa, Michael Krol, Lorne Ahrens and Michael Smith. Brent Thompson, 43, joined DART Police Department in 2009. He is the first to be killed in the line of duty since the agency was established in 1989. He had just married a fellow officer. Before DART he worked for military contractor DynCorp International, mentoring and training teams in Afghanistan and Iraq. He also described himself on Linkedin as someone motivated by a “team” atmosphere, writing: “I enjoy working on challenging tasks and problem solving with my peers. I am constantly looking for different ways to serve the department, this helps to keep my work from becoming sedentary and boring.” Dallas Police Officer Patrick Zamarripa, 32, was a Navy veteran who had imagined being a police officer since childhood, his sister said. He was thrilled with the birth of his daughter two years ago. “He just had a constant smile on his face after he became a father,” his sister Laura Zamarripa said. His Twitter photo shows him holding a small child, and on Father’s Day he tweeted: She let me take nap. Best. #FathersDay Gift. Ever! Dallas Police officer Michael Krol, an eight-year veteran of the department, had a lifelong dream of being a police officer, according to local media reports citing a family member. He had previously served as a Wayne County sheriff’s deputy and worked in county jails from 2003 to 2007, Sheriff Benny Napoleon said Friday. Dallas Police officer Lorne Ahrens was a former semi-pro football player who stood tall at 6′ 5″. He is survived by his wife, two children and a step-child, according to a Washington Post report. Dallas Police Sgt. Michael Smith, 55, was a former Army Ranger and the father of two young children, according to a USA Today report. DART released the names of the other three of its officers injured in the shootings: Omar Cannon, 44, Misty McBride, 32, and Jesus Retana, 39 “As you can imagine, our hearts are broken,” the agency said in a statement. “This is something that touches every part of our organization.

Dallas Police Chief David Brown said Johnson—who told police he was not affiliated with any groups—was killed in a standoff with law enforcement in a parking garage during the early hours of Friday morning. Brown said Johnson told police he was upset with police shootings and wanted to kill white officers. The Dallas shooting began during a protest over police brutality, following the deaths of two black men by police officers in separate incidents this week. “The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” Brown said during a press conference Friday morning. “He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.” Johnson was killed by a police bomb robot after the lengthy standoff. “We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was,” Brown said. “Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger. The suspect is deceased as a result of detonating the bomb.” Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said Johnson had threatened to use bombs. At a press conference on Friday night, Rawlings said officials gave Johnson “plenty of options” for surrender before they used the robotic explosive. “As it concerns the cowardice, it seems as if the sole suspect now has received his justice, and what will be important is to ensure that there are no other potential co-conspirators with this particular assailant,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at the same press conference. While Brown initially said that three suspects, including a woman, had been taken into custody by Dallas police, state and federal officials said on Friday evening that it now appears Johnson acted alone. “As we’ve started to unravel this fishing knot, we realized that the shooting came from one building at different levels from this suspect,” Rawlings said. Police said that during a search of Johnson’s home, detectives found bomb making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition, and a personal journal of combat tactics, which they are still reviewing. In addition to the 12 officers, two civilians were injured in the shooting, which President Barack Obama called a “vicious, calculated and despicable attack.” Write to Tessa Berenson Rogers at tessa.Rogers@time.com and Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4397785/dallas-shooting-police-protest-snipers/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4398698/dallas-shooting-police-chief-david-brown/", "http://time.com/4398034/dallas-shooting-suspect-white-officers/", "http://time.com/4396220/philando-castile-minnesota-shooting/", "http://time.com/4398196/dallas-shooting-bomb-robot/", "http://time.com/4399164/dallas-shooting-mayor-mike-rawlings-prayer-vigil/", "http://time.com/4398685/dallas-shooting-gov-greg-abbott-open-letter/", "http://time.com/4397906/president-barack-obama-sniper-dallas-shootings"], "sentiment_score": -0.047126436781609195, "subjectivity_score": 0.28965517241379307},

Supporters of Alton Sterling, who was killed early Tuesday while police apparently pinned him down outside a convenience store, called for the police chief to be fired or resign and urged residents to boycott the local mall after the fatal shooting. “I, for one, will not rest or not allow him to be swept in the dirt,” said Quinyetta McMillon, 31, the mother of Sterling’s 15-year-old son. The teenager, Cameron Sterling, sobbed loudly and was overcome with emotion as his mother spoke at a news conference. Sterling’s death, which sparked protests in Baton Rouge, was caught in a graphic video, which was widely shared on social media. The footage appears to show two officers approaching Sterling outside of a convenience store. One officer appears to tackle him over the hood of the car, then both pounce on him, apparently to restrain him on the pavement. “As this video has been shared across the world, you will see with your own eyes how he was handled unjustly and killed without regard for the lives that he helped raise,” McMillon, who is not married to Sterling, told reporters. “As a mother, I have now been forced to raise a son who is going to remember what happened to his father that I can’t take away from him,” she added. “He is at an age of understanding. I hurt more for him and his loss.” McMillon wept as she said the greatest failure as a parent is “to see your child hurt and know there’s nothing you can do about it.” Michael McClanahan, head of the NAACP in Baton Rouge, called for Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. to be fired. “He must step down. We cannot have anybody who allows this type of action to take place,” he said. Dabadie said at a news conference that he would not resign and said those who are asking for him to step down from his post were “acting off emotion.” “I’m not retiring. I’m not resigning,” he added later. “I don’t think it’s fair for people to act out of emotion. We have done a lot of good in this community. We’re working diligently to bring the truth out.” Abdul Rashid Muhammad, who leads the local chapter of the Nation of Islam, urged supporters to boycott the Louisiana mall, starting Friday “until we get justice.” “Let’s withhold our money,” he said. “Don’t spend anything.” Sandra Sterling, the aunt of the slain man who raised him, said she was grateful for the unknown bystander who recorded the video but that she was “very disturbed” and “hurt” at what she saw in the footage. “It’s a horrible thing to happen to him,” she told reporters Wednesday. “He didn’t deserve that.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4394411/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-shooting/", "http://time.com/4395056/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-police-chief/"], "sentiment_score": 0.029493464052287567, "subjectivity_score": 0.32957516339869275},

Castile, who was known by friends as Phil, was a cafeteria supervisor at J.J. Hill Montessori Magnet School in Saint Paul, Minn., where he memorized the names of the 500 children he served every day — along with their food allergies, his former coworker said. “He remembered their names. He remembered who couldn’t have milk. He knew what they could have to eat and what they couldn’t,” Joan Edman, a recently retired paraprofessional at the school, told TIME. “This was a real guy. He made a real contribution. Yes, black lives matter. But this man mattered.” A police officer shot Castile, 32, late Wednesday during a traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights, authorities said. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, captured the aftermath of the incident on video and streamed it on Facebook Live, where it went viral. Reynolds told reporters Thursday that her boyfriend was complying with the officer’s instructors to put his hands in the air and get his license and registration. She added that he told police that he had a gun in the car and a permit to carry it. Castile did “nothing but what the police officer asked of us,” she said. “Nothing within his body language said shoot me.” The shooting death shocked Edman, 62, who said Castile was a dutiful worker who adhered to rules strictly. “I’ve never seen anybody take that kind of role so seriously,” she said. “He followed directions carefully.” Castile graduated from Central High School in 2001 and had worked for Saint Paul Public Schools (SPPS) since he was 19 years old, beginning in 2002 in the Nutrition Services Department, the school district said in a statement. He was promoted to a supervisory position two years ago and was currently working at one of the schools during summer break. “I am deeply sorry for his family and for their loss. He’s worked in SPPS for many years and he graduated from our district, so he was one of our own,” SPPS Superintendent Valeria Silva said in the statement. Parents, several of whom rallied for justice outside the tight-knit school Thursday, said they felt safe knowing Castile was in charge of their children’s food and said Castile transformed the cafeteria into a positive and cheerful space. “He was a fixture. I was always happy to see him around school. The cafeteria was a pretty happy place. He was part of the community and an important one,” Andrew Karre, whose 8-year-old son attends J.J. Hill, told TIME. “He was just a nice, caring person who worked at the school, who should not be dead,” said Karre, 37.

Cops fed him four bullets. #Blacklivesmatter\" pic.twitter.com/YXhkXPKQyL In the school district’s statement, an unnamed coworker says Castile was smart and “overqualified” for his position, yet still took his job seriously. “Kids loved him. He was quiet, respectful and kind. I knew him as warm and funny,” the colleague said. “He wore a shirt and tie to his supervisor interview and said his goal was to one day ‘sit on the other side of this table.’” Edman said Castile may have worked inside a kitchen, but he often taught children important lessons in the consequences of stealing and being respectful. “He was much a teacher than any teacher in that building,” Edman said. “We had a calmer cafeteria this year, and I think it was because he was there.” Castile was someone who “has that presence that people respect and they become more respectful too,” Edman said. “I think he did that for kids,” she said. “Kids watch everything, and they saw that. He had so much going for him. He didn’t have an axe to grind. It just doesn’t make sense. This is a real person. Five hundred real children are directly impacted.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4396256/minnesota-shooting-philando-castile-what-know/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4396220/philando-castile-minnesota-shooting/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4396432/philando-castile-police-shooting-minnesota/"], "sentiment_score": 0.19652221927732128, "subjectivity_score": 0.5769383337750684},

Here’s what you need to know about Sterling’s death: What happened? Sterling was killed early Tuesday while two officers had him pinned to the ground of a parking lot outside of a convenience store, according to graphic videos of the incident captured by an unknown bystander. The encounter occurred when the officers were dispatched to Sterling’s location outside the store after Baton Rouge Police Department received a disturbance call after midnight. A caller told a dispatcher that a black man in a red shirt who was selling CDs had threatened him with a gun. “An altercation between Sterling and the officers ensued. Sterling was shot during the altercation and died at the scene,” the police department said in a statement. The footage appears to show two officers approaching Sterling outside of a convenience store. One officer appears to tackle him over the hood of the car, and then both pounce on him, apparently to restrain him on the pavement. At one point, a voice can be heard yelling, “He’s got a gun! Gun!” Gunfire erupts moments later. Another video, provided by the Daily Beast, surfaced later Wednesday and shows the shooting from another angle. Why was Sterling shot? It’s unclear what led the officers—identified as Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake—to open fire on Sterling. The owner of the convenience store, Abdul Muflahi, who knew Sterling, told local media outlets that he never saw Sterling reach for a weapon. Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. said Sterling was armed but that there are still questions about what happened, according to the Associated Press. The police chief at a news conference demanded answers and said “no stone will be left unturned” as authorities work to determine what prompted either one or both of the officers to pull the trigger. “Like you, there is a lot that we do not understand,” Dabadie said. “And at this point, like you, I am demanding answers. Like you, all my prayers are with this community and especially the community and loved ones of Mr. Sterling.” Dabadie said the department is seeking to gather information from the officers’ body cameras. The U.S. Justice Department has opened a civil rights probe into Sterling’s fatal shooting. Who was Sterling? Sterling was remembered as a loving father. His 15-year-old son, Cameron Sterling, wept uncontrollably at a news conference his family held on Wednesday until he was removed from the view of cameras as his mother, Quinyetta McMillon, 31, pledged to fight for justice. “As this video has been shared across the world, you will see with your own eyes how he was handled unjustly and killed without regard for the lives that he helped raise,” McMillon told reporters. “As a mother, I have now been forced to raise a son who is going to remember what happened to his father that I can’t take away from him,” she added. “He is at an age of understanding. I hurt more for him and his loss.” Sandra Sterling, the aunt of the slain main who raised him after his mother died, said Sterling “didn’t deserve” what happened to him. Who are the officers? Authorities identified the two police officers involved in Sterling’s shooting as Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake. Salamoni has been with the Baton Rouge Police Department for four years, while Lake has served for three years, authorities said. Both work for the Uniform Patrol Division and have been placed on paid administrative leave. “The officers feel they were completely justified,” District Attorney Hillar C. Moore III told The Advocate, adding that Baton Rouge police interviewed the two officers before the case was turned over to the Justice Department. In 2014, Lake was one of six Baton Rouge police officers who were placed on administrative leave after being involved in a Dec. 13 shooting of a man who attempted to flee police, the Times Picayune reports. Baton Rouge Police Cpl. L’Jean McKneely told the newspaper at the time that the suspect was shooting at the officers while trying to run away from authorities on foot. The suspect survived the shooting with only moderate injuries, according to The Advocate.

A female passenger streamed the aftermath of the incident on Facebook Live showing Philando Castile, 32, bloodied in the driver’s seat and a police officer with his gun still visible through the window. The woman’s daughter sits in the backseat of the car. In the video, the woman, Diamond Reynolds, says the officer asked Castile for his license and registration. Castile reached for the information as requested and also informed the officer that he had a gun in the car and was licensed to carry, the woman says. “I told him not to reach for it.

He was just getting his license and registration, sir.” The video continues as Reynolds and her daughter are detained and transported in the back of a police car. “It’s OK,” the daughter tells her mother. “I’m right here with you.” The shooting occurred around 9 p.m. in Falcon Heights, a St. Paul suburb, and Castile was declared dead at a nearby hospital less than an hour later, according to the Star Tribune.   The video—now viewed more than 2 million times on Facebook—gained immediate traction online over night. Protesters gathered in front of the governor’s residence in Madison shouting “no justice, no peace.” An investigation into the shooting by the St. Anthony Police officer is being led by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The department’s interim chief said he few details about the incident, according to the Associated Press. The incident occurred as outrage continues in Louisiana over a video of a black man being shot repeatedly by police.

Well, that’s partly because Easter is a week earlier this year. Easter, the day Christians commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, is known as a “moveable feast” because the dates are always different. Likewise, the dates for holidays leading up to it—Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday, Good Friday—shift accordingly. Easter can fall on any Sunday between March 22 and April 25, according to the Gregorian calendar. Introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, it is known as the system that Western Christian churches use to calculate the date. But this method is not in sync with the “lunar” calendar. One explanation, from the Explanatory Supplement to The Astronomical Almanac: In the Gregorian calendar, the date of Easter is defined to occur on the Sunday following the ecclesiastical Full Moon that falls on or next after March 21. This should not be confused with the popular notion that Easter is the first Sunday after the first Full Moon following the vernal equinox. In the first place, the vernal equinox does not necessarily occur on March 21. In addition, the ecclesiastical Full Moon is not the astronomical Full Moon — it is based on tables that do not take into account the full complexity of lunar motion. As a result, the date of an ecclesiastical Full Moon may differ from that of the true Full Moon.  Eastern Orthodox churches, on the other hand, follow the solar, Julian calendar, adopted by Julius Caesar in 45 BC. This timetable has been 13 days ahead of the Gregorian calendar, so that’s why “the Orthodox Easter celebration usually occurs later than that celebrated by Protestants and Roman Catholics,” according to Encyclopedia Britannica. “The Orthodox tradition prohibits Easter from being celebrated before or at the same time as Passover.”  For decades, storekeepers, even religious leaders, have called for a set day for the holiday. Last spring, Pope Francis said he was open to the idea of a fixed date for Easter, and earlier this year, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, announced that he was working with other Christian churches to decide on one in the next “five to 10 years” — recommending it fall on either the second or third Sunday of April.

The segment of the show belonging solely to Coldplay was the set’s worst. Though the band was the halftime show’s notional headliners, it was the least relevant-seeming of the three acts onstage. Bruno Mars and Beyoncé had been invited, the language around the show suggested, as a nod to the franchise’s “history,” and yet they felt far more urgent and intriguing than the British band, whose act was also plagued by significant audio problems. Lead singer Chris Martin’s onstage leaps felt like an attempt to gin up the sort of enthusiasm that Mars, with the opening bars of his hit “Uptown Funk,” generated organically. Mars and Beyoncé are a part of halftime show history, sure, but it’s very recent history. They performed on the world’s biggest stage two and three years ago, respectively. (One wonders whether Katy Perry, last year’s headliner, felt snubbed.) Before the show began, I was among those who questioned what, exactly, the pair of performers were thinking: Beyoncé in particular seemed to have said everything she needed to say with a refined and incredibly ambitious Super Bowl solo set. Why tempt the fates by going for a second act, as someone else’s support? And yet the two transcended not merely expectations but Coldplay’s tepid set. Indeed, the British band practically disappeared for minutes as first Mars, then Beyoncé performed recent hits, “Uptown Funk” and Beyoncé’s new hit “Formation,” then took part in a dance-off. That the latter star announced the Formation World Tour in an ad immediately following the set felt apt; she has clearly entered a new era, building on the themes of social consciousness and complicated feminism present in her prior work (and in her 2013 Super Bowl set). Mars had a new hit to perform; Beyoncé, in putting forward a new song that’s about her pride in her race and dressing in militaristic regalia that recalled the Michael Jackson of 1993, had new things to say. Strangely, what the halftime show did best, though, was fun. Not the forced fun of Martin giddily skipping through songs from 2008, but the genuine (or genuine-seeming) enthusiasm of Beyoncé and Mars’s dance-off to “Uptown Funk,” or, once Martin re-entered the fray, the trio singing about the history of the halftime show as images played. Sure, it was meant as a paean to all halftime shows, or a platonic ideal of celebrity spectacle that exists only in the viewer’s imagination. But the one it specifically recalled was the 2001 show, in which NSYNC, Aerosmith, and Britney Spears cavorted in a loose, carefree way, more concerned with projecting an image of fun and inclusiveness than hitting their marks. Beyoncé’s choreography in “Formation” was impressive, as were the visual effects overlaid on the field. But what was most unusual for a franchise whose recent years have been marked by decadent costuming and extravagant stagecraft was just how much it seemed all involved were genuinely enjoying themselves, unfreighted by ideas of building their fame (Coldplay has been successful for years now, and Beyoncé and Mars have nothing to prove). Rarely has a break in play during the year’s most watched TV event seemed quite so refreshing.

Kalanick, however, claims that such vehicles will still require human labor for two reasons. First, they aren’t great at handling certain road conditions, like bad whether or countryside driving. Until the robot cars master those situations, human drivers will be necessary. Second, those robot cars still require people to maintain them. (For now, anyway.) Here’s Kalanick’s full quote: Business Insider: How do you keep Uber’s driver partners excited about working for Uber when today’s announcement is that you’re one step closer to replacing them? I believe your engineering director said you’re trying to wean riders off having drivers. Kalanick: The first part is that the timescale is pretty long. We’ve got income opportunities today and we got ways of serving the city today. That’s part 1. Part 2 is that if you’re talking about a city like San Francisco or the Bay Area generally, we have like 30,000 active drivers. We are going to go from 30,000 to, let’s say, hypothetically, a million cars, right? But when you go to a million cars you’re still going to need a human-driven parallel, or hybrid. And the reason why is because there are just places that autonomous cars are just not going to be able to go or conditions they’re not going to be able to handle. And even though it is going to be a smaller percentage of the whole, I can imagine 50,000 to 100,000 drivers, human drivers, alongside a million car network. I can imagine 50,000 to 100,000 drivers, human drivers, alongside a million car network. So I don’t think the number of human drivers will go down anytime soon. In fact, I think in an autonomous world, it goes up. In absolute figures. Of course, in percentage it’s down. But then you also think, what about the tens of thousands of jobs that are necessary to maintain that fleet? That said, Kalanick has made no secret of his desire to replace Uber’s human drivers. Those drivers, after all, are not full employees, but rather independent contractors — contractors who often agitate for better pay and other rights, creating legal headaches for the company. His life might be simpler without them. Uber’s drivers will likely be fine in the short term, but those planning on a longtime driving career would be wise to consider alternate routes.

Uber is selling its China operations to its bitter – and more successful – rival, Didi Chuxing, which controls 80% of China’s ride-sharing market. The repercussions of the deal will be felt far beyond China, affecting everything from Uber’s prospects for an IPO to the fate of its competitors in other markets. The transaction will involve merging Uber China, mostly owned by Uber but also owned by search giant Baidu and others, with Didi’s operations. It resolves a costly battle for users that led Uber to burn through $2 billion in the past two years. Uber gets an 18% financial stake in Didi plus a $1 billion investment from the company. Both companies will hold a seat on each other’s boards. Didi Chuxing isn’t a household name among consumers outside China, but the company has quickly emerged as a formidable player in the country’s technology industry. Formed by a merger of China’s two largest ride-sharing apps and boasting investments from Alibaba and integration with WeChat’s messaging app, Didi proved to be a juggernaut that blunted Uber’s ability to gain market share. The news has left the tech world discussing what it all means. Here are some key outcomes from the Didi-Uber deal, which could be unfolding for the next several months. Uber waves a white flag Uber isn’t a company accustomed to defeat, yet this deal marks a clear capitulation in one of its most important markets. “As an entrepreneur, I’ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,” CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in a blog post about the deal. That is, Kalanick didn’t want this, but he realized he had little choice. Perhaps because of board pressure. Bloomberg, which broke the news of the Didi-Uber deal, said last week that investors were pushing for a truce between the two companies. Uber’s defeat is its investors’ gain Uber is departing China with a dazzling door prize: a sizable stake in a de-facto monopoly of China’s ride-sharing market. Uber’s China expedition echoes Yahoo’s experience there. After years of struggling for a foothold in China, Yahoo bought a stake in Alibaba for $1.7 billion in cash and assets, an investment which shored up Yahoo’s profits for years. Uber has swapped the losing end of a costly battle for future profits of a promising tech giant. Uber could finally go public With nearly $6 billion in capital raised in the past year alone, Uber may not need an IPO, a fate Kalanick has worked to avoid. But if private investors are beginning to assert their will, Uber could be going public soon enough. Uber’s losses in developing markets like China have been a key reason the company wasn’t ready for public scrutiny. Selling Uber China eliminates part of those losses and frees up resources to invest elsewhere. Uber could be the huge offering Wall Street has craved to reignite the tech-IPO market. Tech’s China syndrome Uber is only the latest U.S. tech giant to either stumble while pushing into China’s market or to decide early on to forego such an effort. Yahoo’s Alibaba investment marked the end of its active presence there. eBay was elbowed aside by Alibaba-owned TaoBao. Facebook and Google have little presence there because of the government’s censorship policies. Chip companies like Intel and enterprise businesses like that of Microsoft’s have fared slightly better, but the consumer Internet in China remains a domestic industry. Bad news for Lyft Last September, Didi invested $100 million in Lyft as part of a so-called anti-Uber alliance, a move that boosted Lyft’s prospects. Didi also forged partnerships with Uber rivals in others areas, such as Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia. It’s not clear where those partnerships stand right now, but if Kalanick sits on Didi’s board, there will either be some severing of those older ties or some interesting conflicts among Didi’s various partners. It gets (even more) complicated With Didi investing $1 billion in Uber, Apple, which in May invested $1 billion in Didi, becomes an indirect investor in Uber. Google also invested in Uber in 2013, even though Uber is now spurning Google Maps for its own technology. All three companies are racing to develop self-driving cars. Even odder, with its investment in Didi, Uber now owns part of a company with a $100 million investment in Lyft. What next? All of this sets the stage for some interesting potential outcomes. Will Uber’s capitulation inspire venture capitalists to take hard stands on other unicorns? Could an Uber IPO break the logjam of unicorn IPOs? Will this deal increase the pace of tech mergers? And how are all these increasingly tangled tech giants going to compete with each other when they invest in each other? The ripples from this deal will be playing out for some time.

But as the technology develops, questions have been raised about what it would mean if autonomous vehicles start hitting the roads in larger numbers.

In explaining the deal, he referenced some of the technology’s potential applications beyond gaming: spectator sports, education and medicine. And though he didn’t say anything about VR changing moviemaking, he might well have. I recently wrote about Zero Point, a documentary about virtual reality, which is designed to be experienced as virtual reality on Oculus’s headset. It was created using a proprietary camera system that captures 360 degrees’ worth of 3D video and then stitches it altogether. Now a startup called Jaunt is talking about its own similar technology for what it calls “cinematic VR.” It plans to sell it to moviemakers in Hollywood and elsewhere who want to capture, edit and distribute movies for viewing on the Rift and other VR headsets, such as the one Sony is developing for use with the PlayStation 3. Jaunt started experimenting with 3D VR cameras by building a tiny prototype using Lego parts. It’s moved on to more ambitious designs and now has a model–no Lego involved–with which it’s created some demo footage. The company let me sample the results at its offices, using the HD version of the Oculus Rift developer kit. The demo included several short scenes, including a horror-movie like bit set at sea, involving what seemed to be a monstrous octopus. That part had me spinning around in my seat to see the action all around me. The company’s current hardware is a fixed camera setup, which stays in one place and captures almost everything around it, with the exception of the area directly below the cameras — basically, where your feet would be in the virtual-reality world. It also captures 3D sound, which is an important storytelling tool: In a VR movie, your ears will know there’s something going on behind you before your eyes do. Of course, capturing 3D video and sound is only the start of the VR movie-making process. Jaunt is also developing the technology necessary to assemble raw footage into polished movies using industry-standard software such as Apple’s Final Cut Pro video editor. It’s also working on the question of how these movies will be distributed to consumers who have VR headsets–a necessary factor nobody has yet figured out. Basically, VR movie-making is so new a concept that the company has to build an end-to-end system, a task it compares to what IMAX had to do when it was a startup. “After we starred, we realized it’s a much bigger project than we ever imagined,” says co-founder and CTO Arthur van Hoff. Jaunt isn’t yet talking about when movies using its technology might arrive. That’s O.K. Oculus Rift and Sony’s headset aren’t yet commercial products, so it’s going to be a while before consumers will be ready to enter virtual worlds from the comfort of their own living rooms.

The source of all this hype involves a pair of largish scuba-like goggles, dubbed Oculus Rift, that you clap on your face and tether to a computer. What it’s not: a sensation-gifting body mesh, nor a virtual retinal laser mounted to a pair of stylish lightweight glasses, nor the holy grail of holy grails that eventually makes any of this moot: a neural interface, probably using cell-sized nanobots, that’ll offer the option to engage any reality you like, anywhere you like, any time you like. Getting the timeframes right for these things matters, and VR’s track record leaves a lot of be desired. If you’re not skeptical about Oculus’ technology or Facebook’s claims about what it means, you should be. And I’d recommend listening to former Microsoft guy and Xbox co-founder Ed Fries, who offered saner, more skeptical comments on Yabbly last week about the probability that VR is going to be a mass market force anytime soon. Here’s Fries responding to a question about Facebook’s purchase signaling the advent of VR-as-mainstream: Hardcore gamers love new technologies and experiences and are willing to do almost anything to get them so that’s a good market for Oculus. General users however are a different crowd. Given how little success the consumer electronics companies have had with 3D TVs with glasses, I am skeptical that general users are going to be strapping this thing onto their face any time soon. Bingo. Oculus Rift is technology for enthusiasts, whether that’s playing games or having more visually reified social experiences all the way up to hypotheticals (use your imagination) involving virtual erotica. It involves relatively crude body-plus-plus technology that’s as cumbersome and restrictive as it promises to be liberating. It’s not a natural baby step forward from carrying a phone around in your pocket, it’s a radical shift toward wearing something unfashionable and subtractive (unlike augmented reality, Google Glass style, which treats VR as supplemental). It’s a somewhat more advanced version of a very old form of wraparound reality simulation, in other words, a clever trick that still employs a reductive sensory interface. It is, as TIME’s Lev Grossman poetically writes, the end of the frame, but I’d add not the end of the picture. Tim Sweeney, who founded Epic Games and built the Unreal Engine, evangelized the tech in a Polygon brief yesterday, saying “It’s technology that I think will completely change the world,” then adding “I think it’s going to be a bigger phenomenon than smartphones.” For some reason that got attention instead of the more interesting part of the interview in which Sweeney talks about shareware and 1991 and selling direct to gamers. But “completely change the world” sounds bolder and sexier and somehow imminent, and people like to dream, even if the notion that virtual reality’s going to change everything (for better or worse) has been in vogue with sci-fi writers and futurists since at least my 1980s childhood. I’m not a VR luddite, I just see the timeframe for wide-scale adoption differently. I don’t think the tipping point for VR is putting scuba-gear on your face so you can pretend to sip virtual coffee with virtual friends, or use it to train to be a virtual helicopter pilot in a virtual flight sim. Someone’s going to want to do that, sure (and plenty already do using wraparound simulators), but this notion that Oculus Rift is going to be the iPhone of VR…it’s just wishful thinking. I’ve already invested in Oculus Rift (you’re welcome, Zuck). I put my $50 payment down on a $350 devkit 2, due this summer, a few weeks ago. I can’t wait to dive in, but then I’ve been sampling virtual reality technology all my life, from kaleidoscopes and View Masters to Virtual Boys and amusement park one-offs (like a crude, fully-helmeted game I played two decades ago at the Mall of America in which I stumbled around a boxing-style ring firing virtual laser beams at another helmeted opponent). I get the excitement, I just don’t see these mass adoption timeframes at the same pace as companies like Oculus, or new-minted $2 billion VR proselytizers like Mark Zuckerberg. Zuck says VR is the next big thing after mobile. But a year from now? 10? 100? VR’s one of these things we can talk about like solving aging, or eradicating superstition, or curing cancer and use words like “eventually” or “inevitable.” You can’t be wrong. But you can be wrong about the timeframes, and for all the excitement building around Oculus’ spendy scuba-gear, I don’t see smartphone/tablet levels of consumer adoption on VR’s menu anytime soon.

Oculus makes the Oculus Rift, a virtual-reality headset originally funded on Kickstarter. The deal includes $400 million in cash and $1.6 billion in Facebook stock, as well as an additional $300 million if Oculus meets certain performance targets. Oculus will continue to operate independently at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2014. Though the Rift has been pitched as a video-gaming device, Facebook plans to use its technology for communications, media and other forms of entertainment. In a conference call with analysts, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive officer, said virtual reality has the potential to be the next great computing evolution, following the transition from desktop computers to mobile devices. “Oculus has the potential to be the most social platform ever,” he said. ‘“Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures.” In a post on his Facebook profile page, Zuckerberg presented such scenarios as sitting courtside at a sports event, studying with a group of students or consulting face-to-face with a doctor as potential uses for virtual reality. The acquisition amount is a huge sum for a company that has yet to release a consumer-facing product. The Oculus Rift made its public debut at the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo, the video-game industry’s largest trade show. That summer the company launched a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign in which it eclipsed its $250,000 funding goal nearly 10 times over. Interest in the device has risen steadily since then, with the company raising more than $90 million in venture funding over the past two years. As many as 75,000 people have ordered developer kits in order to test the device and begin making software for it. And owners of the device can already use an Oculus Rift to play PC games, enter the world of Game of Thrones or even visit a supermarket. However, the company has not yet released a version of its headset for sale to the general public. Zuckerberg did not provide a timetable for when that might happen. For now, the Oculus team’s focus will remain on gaming. Facebook chief financial officer David Ebersman told investors that the $2 billion valuation of the company was based on gaming opportunities alone, and it’s not a lonely field: Sony revealed its own virtual-reality headset last week and Microsoft has recently expressed interest in the technology. The acquisition comes just weeks after Facebook announced it would purchase the messaging service WhatsApp for $19 billion. Zuckerberg noted that he didn’t expect Facebook’s buying spree to continue, but that the company would open its wallet for companies that it thinks offer a unique value opportunity. “There are not that many companies that are building core technologies that can be the next major computing platform,” he said of Oculus. Facebook does not yet have a business model for Oculus, but revenues won’t center around selling Oculus Rift headsets. Zuckerberg said he could envision people visiting virtual worlds where they can buy goods and are served advertisements. The huge purchase shows that every major tech player is making a big bet on wearable devices. Google is continuing to develop its Google Glass hardware and just announced a version of its Android operating system tailored for smart watches. Samsung already has a line of smart watches. With Oculus, Facebook is making a remarkably bold bet that people in the future will want to be fully immersed in technology. “We feel like we should be looking ahead and thinking about what the next platforms are going to be,” Zuckerberg said. “We think vision is going to be the next really big platform.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.12706511175898932, "subjectivity_score": 0.4508260447035958},

He’s very respectable and I know he didn’t antagonize that officer in any way.” “We’re being hunted every day,” she later added. “It’s a silent war against African-American people as a whole. We’re never free.” The aftermath of the shooting was captured on video, which was streamed on Facebook Live by the victim’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds. The video shows Philando Castile covered in blood as he’s slumped in the driver’s seat of a vehicle. “Police just shot my boyfriend for no apparent reason,” Reynolds says. St. Anthony Police interim police chief Jon Mangseth told the Associated Press that a police officer pulled over a vehicle around 9 p.m. in Falcon Heights and that “shots were fired” during the stop, but did not immediately provide more details. Reynolds says in the video that the vehicle was pulled over for a “busted taillight.” The officer asked Philando Castile for his license and registration, she says. Castile reached for the information as requested and also informed the officer that he had a gun in the car and was licensed to carry before the officer opened fire, according to Reynolds. The victim’s uncle, Clarence Castile, said he was horrified by what he saw in the footage, saying there was “blood everywhere.” “He’s not an officer. He’s just a man. An officer is supposed to protect and serve. That man is a destroyer. He came into our lives and took something from us,” he told CNN.

But while the task force’s recommendations have indeed been embraced by some of the nation’s law enforcement, its effects have been noticeably limited. According to a one-year update by the Task Force, at least nine states and municipalities have taken significant steps to implement their recommendations and law enforcement agencies in every state have in some way grappled with reform. In May 2016, 15 police departments signed on to join the “Advancing 21st Century Policing Initiative.” However, those successes are a drop in the bucket for the task force considering there are 18,000 police departments in the United States. Even President Obama mentioned his frustration with the slow pace of change even as he praised the task force’s suggested reforms. “Change has been too slow and we have to have a greater sense of urgency about this,” the President said Thursday. In conversations with TIME on Friday, several members of the Task Force said they still believe their work will make a difference. “The pillars that we laid out—those pillars are an absolutely great foundational platform for building the transformation plan that each department needs to go through,” said Constance Rice, a civil rights attorney and task force member.  But another task force member, Brittany Packnett, said that change cannot be expected to happen overnight. “We are dealing with issues that are deeply rooted in systemic racism and oppression and those roots go all the way back to the founding of this country,” says Packnett, adding that the implementation of all of the recommendations would merely be one step in the right direction. “It’s unrealistic to think that in a years time we’re going to uproot systemic oppression and racism.” Laurie Robinson, a George Mason University professor and co-chair of the Task Force, was more optimistic, arguing that the report’s influence in such a short period of time has been unprecedented. “It would be a rare police chief who isn’t aware of the report or hasn’t at least skimmed through it,” Robinson said. But she cautioned that the impact of the recommendations must still “trickle” down to officers on the ground who often make split-second decisions in the line of duty. “That takes time,” says Robinson. “Not just with training, but also with some culture change.”  One bittersweet sign of the task force’s influence is that the community-first approach recommended in the report is already being implemented in Dallas, the sight of Thursday’s brutal attack. A 2015 report by the Dallas Morning News found that complaints of excessive force had ratcheted down to their lowest point in nearly two decades. Police Chief David Brown told the paper that “training, community policing and holding officers accountable” had made a difference. Lopez said the tragic events in Dallas are emblematic of the ripple effect incidents across the country can have. “When on a daily basis someone in law enforcement messes up and takes the life of an unarmed individual it doesn’t help,” Lopez says. “It doesn’t help police officers on the ground do the job that they need to do to build trust across the country.”  Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4397611/president-obama-sterling-castile-shootings-we-are-better-than-this/", "http://time.com/3678616/obamas-police-task-force-ferguson/", "http://time.com/3728880/task-force-police-shootings/"], "sentiment_score": -0.012716869693613886, "subjectivity_score": 0.4024732373569584},

A sniper shot officers on duty at a peaceful protest following the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile by Louisiana and Minnesota police officers earlier this week. The suspect was shot and killed after a standoff with police. The victims include Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) officer Brent Thompson and Dallas Police Department officers Patrick Zamarripa, Michael Krol, Lorne Ahrens and Michael Smith. Brent Thompson, 43, joined DART Police Department in 2009. He is the first to be killed in the line of duty since the agency was established in 1989. He had just married a fellow officer. Before DART he worked for military contractor DynCorp International, mentoring and training teams in Afghanistan and Iraq. He also described himself on Linkedin as someone motivated by a “team” atmosphere, writing: “I enjoy working on challenging tasks and problem solving with my peers. I am constantly looking for different ways to serve the department, this helps to keep my work from becoming sedentary and boring.” Dallas Police Officer Patrick Zamarripa, 32, was a Navy veteran who had imagined being a police officer since childhood, his sister said. He was thrilled with the birth of his daughter two years ago. “He just had a constant smile on his face after he became a father,” his sister Laura Zamarripa said. His Twitter photo shows him holding a small child, and on Father’s Day he tweeted: She let me take nap. Best. #FathersDay Gift. Ever! Dallas Police officer Michael Krol, an eight-year veteran of the department, had a lifelong dream of being a police officer, according to local media reports citing a family member. He had previously served as a Wayne County sheriff’s deputy and worked in county jails from 2003 to 2007, Sheriff Benny Napoleon said Friday. Dallas Police officer Lorne Ahrens was a former semi-pro football player who stood tall at 6′ 5″. He is survived by his wife, two children and a step-child, according to a Washington Post report. Dallas Police Sgt. Michael Smith, 55, was a former Army Ranger and the father of two young children, according to a USA Today report. DART released the names of the other three of its officers injured in the shootings: Omar Cannon, 44, Misty McBride, 32, and Jesus Retana, 39 “As you can imagine, our hearts are broken,” the agency said in a statement. “This is something that touches every part of our organization. We have received countless expressions of support and sympathy from around the world through the evening. We are grateful for every message. Thank you.” “We are grateful to report the three other Dart police officers shot during the protest are expected to recover from their injuries. No other Dart employees working in Downtown during the protest or shooting were injured.

Comcast is currently seeking regulatory approval for its proposed $45 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable. As high-bandwidth services like Netflix have exploded in popularity — during evening hours the service accounts for as much as one-third of all Internet traffic, according to industry estimates — the broadband companies are increasingly demanding compensation in exchange for direct connections to improve performance. Faster speeds mean better video quality and fewer interruptions for Netflix viewers. (MORE: Netflix vs. Comcast ‘Net Neutrality’ Spat Erupts After Traffic Deal) Comcast jumped six spots higher on the list — leapfrogging Time Warner Cable, Verizon, AT&T U-verse and other providers — and its customers are seeing the best Netflix performance in 16 months. The performance boost comes after a precipitous decline in Netflix speeds for Comcast subscribers that began last fall, leading to numerous complaints about service quality. By striking a paid-peering interconnection agreement with Comcast, Netflix gained a direct connection to the broadband giant’s network, bypassing bandwidth providers that operate as third-party intermediaries between residential broadband companies like Comcast and Time Warner Cable and Internet firms like Netflix and YouTube. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but many Wall Street analysts don’t believe it will have a material impact on Netflix’s bottom line. Nevertheless, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings complained bitterly about having to pay “an arbitrary tax” to Comcast in order to improve service for customers, and urged federal regulators to include paid peering agreements in the new net neutrality rules currently under development by the Federal Communications Commission. Such agreements were not covered by the FCC’s 2010 Open Internet order, which was struck down by a federal judge in January. Hastings called for the FCC’s new rules to prevent service providers like Comcast from “charging a toll for interconnection to services like Netflix, YouTube, or Skype, or intermediaries such as Cogent, Akamai or Level 3, to deliver the services and data requested by ISP residential subscribers.” Internet service providers, Hastings said, “must provide sufficient access to their network without charge.” That suggestion is fiercely opposed the nation’s largest ISPs, which for years have complained that they are obliged to deliver high bandwidth content — which often competes with their own video offerings — over the infrastructure they’ve spent billions of dollars to build. Both Verizon and AT&T have acknowledged that they are seeking to extract similar fees from Netflix in order to improve service for customers. Google Fiber, the tech giant’s gigabit fiber broadband service, remains by far the fastest U.S. provider of Netflix streaming video, with average performance of 3.60Mbps, according to Netflix. Google has already launched fiber initiatives in Kansas City, Austin and Provo, and last month announced plans to work with nine more metro areas to expand the service. Netflix says its ISP speed index is “based on data from the more than 44 million Netflix members worldwide who view over 1 billion hours of TV shows and movies streaming from Netflix each month. The listed speeds reflect the average performance of all Netflix streams on each ISP’s network and are an indicator of the performance typically experienced across all users on an ISP network.

Easter is one of the “moveable feasts,” a holiday that falls on a different calendar date each year. It’s calculated as the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after the vernal equinox. Though the beginning of spring generally happens around the same time every year — the church uses March 21 as the date — the lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar don’t match up, which means the timing of the full moon can change quite a bit. (This year, that full moon came on April 4.) Easter thus has about a month’s worth of time in which to move around. That system worked for hundreds of years, but as Easter became not only a religious holiday, but also an occasion for sales, shopping and parades, the mobility of the fête began to cause a problem. Stocking Easter goodies and planning projected profits is difficult to do when the calendar moves around, and even more so if you use Easter to mark the start of the whole shopping season. So in 1926, a group of storekeepers came up with a solution: fix the date. Not fix as in “make better”; fix as in “fix in place.” As TIME explained on Feb. 1 of that year: This inconstancy of Eastertide has irritated money-grubbing merchants, who long have surreptitiously, indirectly exported the spirited, springtime surge of joy, light and purity felt by celebrants. People have stepped from decorating their altars to decking their bodies, until the Easter Sunday “parade” of fashionables and fops gets more notice in the lay press than does the sanctity of the holiday. This display of clothes and flowers and jewels and carriages, wily merchandisers have gloated over. None the less they have peered with squinted eye at the fluctuating date of the festival, even as they touted a robe as “hot from N’ York, lady,” or “new from Paris, madame.” Last week the Manhattan Merchants’ Association stepped into the clear; advocated a constant Easter; stated in a bulletin that the second Sunday in April “will be” the date it believes will be adopted; said further: “A late Easter often proves disastrous to sellers of many lines of merchandise because it shortens the spring season, thereby reducing the volume of business, while the lengthened winter season is of little benefit. With the adoption of a fixed date, all such difficulties will disappear. The church’s response to the proposal? “Clergymen,” TIME reported, “were vexed.” Nearly 90 years later we know that there was no need for such vexation: Though TIME didn’t follow up on the story, Easter is still moving around the same way it always has.

Comcast should not be permitted to buy smaller rival Time Warner Cable in a $45 billion deal now being scrutinized by U.S. regulators, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings argued in a letter to shareholders, because the cable giant is already too powerful. It’s the second time in a month that Hastings has attacked Comcast, following a controversial deal in which the streaming video company agreed to pay for a direct connection to the nation’s largest broadband provider. “Comcast is already dominant enough to be able to capture unprecedented fees from transit providers and services such as Netflix,” Hastings wrote. “The combined company would possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers.” Comcast’s response was swift. The broadband giant accused Netflix of using “net neutrality“—the principle enshrined in the now-defunct U.S. Open Internet rules that prohibited Internet service providers from favoring some online services—as a pretext for advancing its own commercial interests. In essence, Comcast says that Netflix is taking advantage of regulatory scrutiny of the Time Warner Cable deal to try to make interconnection deals—standard business arrangements that have existed between Internet and broadband companies for years—a net neutrality issue. And it’s doing this, according to Comcast, to bolster its own bottom line. “Internet interconnection has nothing to do with net neutrality,” Comcast wrote in a company blog post. “It’s all about Netflix wanting to unfairly shift its costs from its customers to all Internet customers, regardless of whether they subscribe to Netflix or not.” In its 2010 Open Internet order, which was struck down by a federal judge in January, the Federal Communications Commission made clear that interconnection deals were not subject to the net neutrality rules. As part of its deal with Comcast, Netflix gained a direct connection to the nation’s largest broadband company, bypassing bandwidth providers that operate as intermediaries between residential broadband companies and Internet firms. The agreement is already benefitting Netflix customers who subscribe to Comcast broadband service. Last week, Netflix said that streaming speeds to Comcast users had increased by 65% between January and March. Comcast says that if Netflix is not happy with their interconnection pact, it’s free to terminate the pact. “If Netflix did not like the terms of our agreement, or if they do not like the terms Comcast provides at any time in the future, Netflix can work with any of the multiplicity of partners that connect with Comcast,” the broadband giant wrote. Comcast pointed out that “Netflix approached us for this direct connection between Netflix and Comcast, cutting out the wholesalers with whom Netflix had traditionally contracted and paid for transit. This arrangement was thus about Netflix exercising its market power to extract a more favorable arrangement directly from Comcast than what Netflix had been paying for through third party providers.” “Netflix is free to express its opinions,” Comcast concluded. “But they should be factually based. And Netflix should be transparent that its opinion is not about protecting the consumer or about Net Neutrality. Rather, it’s about improving Netflix’s business model by shifting costs that it has always borne to all users of the Internet and not just to Netflix customers.” Paid interconnection agreements have been a common feature of the Internet’s behind-the-scenes architecture for many years, but now Netflix wants to frame such deals in terms of net neutrality. Moving forward, the FCC will decide whether deals like the one struck by Comcast and Netflix will be covered by the Open Internet rules. As of now, that’s not the case. Dan Rayburn, principal analyst at Frost & Sullivan and executive vice president of StreamingMedia.com, says Netflix arguments against Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable aren’t valid. “This argument between Netflix and Comcast about interconnection deals has nothing to do with net neutrality,” Rayburn wrote on Monday. “This isn’t about ‘fighting for the Internet the world needs,’ like Netflix has said, it’s about keeping their costs down.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/70860/netflix-price-increase-coming-soon/", "http://time.com/32784/netflix-comcast-net-neutrality/", "http://time.com/54687/comcast-twc-congress-hearing-senate/", "http://time.com/32784/netflix-comcast-net-neutrality/", "http://time.com/9373/comcast-netflix-deal/", "http://time.com/32784/netflix-comcast-net-neutrality/", "https://time.com/71465/comcast-netflix-feud/controversial", "http://time.com/62903/netflix-comcast-speed-boost/"], "sentiment_score": 0.07844444444444446, "subjectivity_score": 0.47422222222222216},

The conflict between two of the most powerful technology companies in the world — with billions of dollars at stake — has been escalating for years, and underscores the ferocious struggle for advantage in the highly competitive smartphone and tablet markets. Apple and Samsung have accused each other of blatantly copying design features used in each company’s smartphones and tablets. For Apple, the campaign against Samsung amounts to a proxy war against Google’s Android operating system, which powers the most popular Samsung devices. Apple has already won one major patent infringement case against Samsung, resulting in damages that were ultimately pegged at $930 million. Samsung is appealing that verdict. The new case covers recent mobile devices, including the iPhone 5 and the latest models in Samsung’s Galaxy line. Apple is demanding about $2 billion in damages, and asking that Samsung be ordered to pay a $40 licensing fee for each phone. Patent expert Florian Mueller thinks Apple’s claim is outlandish. “Give me a break,” he wrote last week. “Reality distortion would be a total understatement for this.” For Apple, this case isn’t about money so much as principle. Apple is nearing $200 billion in annual revenue and sitting on tens of billions in cash. Apple doesn’t need $2 billion. What it wants more than money is validation that its engineers were responsible for inventing the modern smartphone. Apple’s late CEO Steve Jobs was convinced that Google and its partners copied most of the Android operating system and form-factor from the iPhone. The rift caused Google chairman Eric Schmidt to be politely dismissed from Apple’s board of directors five years ago. Jobs famously vowed to wage “thermonuclear war” against those whom he felt had ripped off the iPhone, and the multibillion-dollar lawsuits against Samsung and other Android hardware makers are the legacy of Jobs’ conviction. (MORE: Apple’s $1 Billion Patent Win Over Samsung Rattles Google’s Cage) Apple charges that Samsung “systematically copied Apple’s innovative technology and products, features, and designs, and has deluged markets with infringing devices in an effort to usurp market share from Apple. Instead of pursuing independent product development, Samsung slavishly copied Apple’s innovative technology, with its elegant and distinctive user interfaces product design, in violation of Apple’s valuable intellectual property rights.” Samsung has filed a countersuit denying that charge and claiming that Apple “has infringed and continues to infringe,” on Samsung patents. “Without the ability to enforce its intellectual property rights, such as those relating to mobile device technology at issue in this action, Samsung would not be able to sustain the extensive commitment to research and development that has enabled it to lead the way into numerous improvements across a broad range of technologies, including the mobile device technologies at issue in this action,” Samsung said. The patents involved in the case relate to the iPhone’s universal search feature, as well as technology that enables links inside text messages, and syncs calendar, email and address book data. Another patent involves the iPhone’s predictive text feature, which suggests text after the user has entered a few characters. Perhaps the most controversial patent in the case applies to the slide-to-unlock feature, which has become a familiar ritual for millions of smartphone users around the world. (MORE: Aereo Boss Says He’s ‘Confident’ Ahead of Supreme Court Battle) Over the last decade, an escalating patent arms race has gripped the tech world. Most of the major tech giants, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung have engaged in patent litigation and counter-litigation in multiple jurisdictions around the globe. So far, the biggest winners have been patent lawyers, who reap millions of dollars in fees during these multiyear legal disputes. Many patent experts believe that rampant intellectual-property litigation hinders competition, increases prices for consumers, and impedes innovation by slowing new products to market. “There’s a widespread suspicion that lots of the kinds of software patents at issue are written in ways that cover more ground than what Apple or any other tech firm actually invented,” Notre Dame law professor Mark McKenna told the Associated Press. “Overly broad patents allow companies to block competition.” Last week, Apple allowed Greg Christie, one of its top software engineers, to speak publicly about the early development of the iPhone. Christie is one of several Apple employees who are listed as inventors on the slide-to-unlock patent, which was filed in 2009. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Christie described how his team worked for years to meet Steve Jobs’ exacting standards. Fortune writer Philip Elmer-DeWitt suggested it was no coincidence that Apple trotted Christie out just days before the trial. Apple wanted to make a point: We invented this technology. Although Apple and Samsung will be the two tech titans squaring off in Judge Lucy Koh’s San Jose courtroom on Monday, Google will loom large in the proceedings. That’s because Apple’s multiyear patent battle against Samsung and other handset makers is really a proxy war against Google’s Android operating system, which powers their most popular devices. Several Google executives could be called to testify. The trial is expected to last through early March.

But that confidence comes at a price for Netflix, which has capitulated to the demand made by the Philadelphia-based broadband behemoth that it pay a financial cost for the massive amount of traffic it sends to consumers. It’s not hard to see why Netflix felt the need to strike a pact with Comcast. Over the past few months, the average speed of Netflix streaming video content delivered to Comcast subscribers has declined by more than 25%, according to Netflix, which publishes monthly speed reports. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, prompting criticism from some in the public-interest community about the secrecy of these types of commercial arrangements. Public-interest groups are also concerned that such deals could normalize an environment in which giant broadband providers extract fees simply for delivering Internet content to consumers. Deep-pocketed companies like Netflix can surely afford to pay such fees, but startups may not be able to do so, public-interest advocates warn, which could stifle the development of the next generation of Internet-based services. The deal highlights an ongoing structural shift in the physical and commercial architecture of the Internet as consumers use increasing amounts of bandwidth. It also underscores the growing leverage held by broadband giants like Comcast, Verizon and Time Warner Cable in negotiations with Internet content companies. At a time when the relationship between broadband companies and Internet firms is under intense regulatory scrutiny, the pact is further evidence that private financial deals are the new front in the multiyear battle for advantage between these corporate giants. (MORE: Here’s Why Your Netflix Is Slowing Down) The agreement offers benefits for both companies. Netflix gains a direct connection to the nation’s largest broadband company, bypassing bandwidth providers that operate as intermediaries between residential broadband companies and Internet firms. For its part, Comcast can use the pact as evidence that it is “playing nicely” with Internet companies at a time when the company is seeking regulatory approval for its proposed deal to buy Time Warner Cable, which would create a broadband colossus with unprecedented market power. (Time Warner Cable was spun off from TIME parent Time Warner in 2009.) Technically speaking, the deal is known as a paid-peering or transit agreement, in which Internet companies pay the broadband giants for the right to link to their networks at interconnection points around the country. Traditionally, peering agreements were straightforward deals in which bandwidth companies agreed to carry roughly equal amounts of traffic. If the traffic exchange was symmetrical, no money exchanged hands. But with the explosion of high-bandwidth services like Netflix, the broadband companies are increasingly demanding compensation in exchange for those direct connections. As broadband-based video services like Netflix and YouTube have surged in popularity, the big broadband companies have expressed displeasure that they are obliged to deliver high bandwidth content — which often competes with their own video offerings — over the infrastructure that they have spent billions of dollars to build. In essence, the broadband companies feel that Netflix and YouTube are getting a “free ride.” In 2005, incoming AT&T CEO Ed Whitacre famously remarked that upstarts like Google would like to “use my pipes free, but I ain’t going to let them do that because we have spent this capital and we have to have a return on it.” Prior to Sunday’s agreement, Netflix was connecting with Comcast’s network through intermediaries at five or fewer locations around the country, according to a person familiar with the deal. Now Netflix will be able to connect directly to Comcast’s network at dozens of locations, the person says, which should improve performance for consumers. Netflix had wanted to install caching equipment inside Comcast’s network — which would have brought the most popular content closer to consumers — but the broadband giant was not comfortable with such an agreement. Instead, the two companies will connect their networks directly. (MORE: Comcast Set to Buy Time Warner Cable for $45 Billion) Although financial terms of the arrangement were not disclosed, the amount of money changing hands is “de minimis,” says the person familiar with the deal. “The fees are paid to operate the networking gear at the locations where the networks are connected,” the person says, adding that the new arrangement could actually save Netflix money over the course of several years. That’s because Comcast presented the video service with better financial terms than it had received from the bandwidth intermediaries that Netflix was previously using to connect to Comcast’s network. In a statement, the two companies said Netflix would receive “no preferential network treatment under the multi-year agreement.” John Bergmayer, senior staff attorney at Public Knowledge, a public-interest group based in Washington, D.C., says the deal is alarming not only because of its secrecy but also because it puts residential broadband companies in the business of charging Internet companies to deliver content to consumers. “No one on the outside knows what is happening in this market,” says Bergmayer. “However, it is clear that residential ISPs should be in the business of charging their users for access the Internet, not of charging the rest of the Internet for access to their users. This ensures that they are putting the needs of their users first.” The Federal Communications Commission’s 2010 Open Internet Order prohibited broadband companies like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon from blocking or discriminating against rival services on their networks. But last month, a federal court struck down most of the FCC’s order because the agency had earlier failed to classify broadband as a “telecommunications” service, which would have allowed it to establish “common carrier” regulations prohibiting the broadband giants from discriminating against rival services. Comcast is bound to abide by open-Internet principles until 2018 because of an agreement it made with the government as part of its purchase of entertainment giant NBCUniversal, and the company has said it will extend that agreement to cover Time Warner Cable, if regulators approve the deal. But the Open Internet Order — which enshrined the principle of “net neutrality” — only applies to the “last mile” connection into consumers’ homes. The FCC’s order specifically exempted “existing arrangements for network interconnection, including existing paid peering arrangements,” which means that the deal struck by Comcast and Netflix is not covered by the rules.

{"type": "article", "header": "After WhatsApp and Oculus, Is There Anything Facebook Won’t Acquire?", "author": "Harry McCracken", "update_date/publish_date": "March 25, 2014 7:48 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/37920/facebook-buys-oculus/", "text": "I was sitting in a briefing this afternoon with a tech startup, tapping notes on my iPad, when an e-mail notification popped up at the top of my screen: “Oculus Joins Facebook.” I had to restrain myself from doing a double-take and wondering aloud: “Does that mean what I think it means?” Sure does. Facebook is acquiring Oculus VR, the maker of the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset, for $2 billion in stock and cash. It’s a huge deal — potentially a bigger one than last month’s Facebook shocker, its $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, in every aspect except the money involved. That’s because Oculus is building something that feels potentially as transformative as the graphical user interface, the mouse, the touchscreen, speech recognition or any of the other elements that have changed the way we interact with technology in the past. What it gives you — a 3D world you can explore by looking up, down and all around you — will be spectacular for games. But it’s not hard to imagine future versions of the technology being applied to other sorts of activities we perform using computing devices. Such as — just to pick an example at random — social networking. I do confess feeling a twinge of sadness at the news: Technology breakthroughs are most exciting when they’re brought to us by scrappy startups, rather than large companies that happen to have enough money to acquire smaller ones. But I can’t begrudge Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg his new toy. When I tried Oculus Rift for the first time in its pre-release form last September, I was blown away as thoroughly as I’ve been blown away by any tech demo I’ve seen during my 23 years of writing about this stuff. If I’d had a spare $2 billion, I would have tried to buy the company, too. And if you haven’t tried Rift yet for yourself, the acquisition may make less sense to you than if you’ve strapped it on even briefly. Zuckerberg’s timeline post about the deal on his own Facebook page explains why Oculus’s technology is interesting to Facebook in what seems like a pretty straightforward fashion: Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won’t be changing and we hope to accelerate. The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there’s a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform. We’re going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games. Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this. But this is just the start. After games, we’re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face — just by putting on goggles in your home. This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures. Before the WhatsApp and Oculus acquisitions, Facebook still felt like a vastly richer, more popular version of the thing Zuck built in his dorm room in 2004: a social network for helping you keep track of your friends and their activities. Now it’s clear its aspirations aren’t anywhere near so well defined. WhatsApp is already a phenomenon unto itself, the most important of several services that threaten to render text messaging obsolete in its old-fashioned, supplied-by-a-wireless-carrier form. And if Oculus takes off, Facebook may take a lead role in defining the future of human-machine interaction. Even Zuckerberg doesn’t have an infinite war chest, and Facebok isn’t the only company willing to pay huge money for potentially epoch-shifting startups. (Exhibit A: Google’s $3 billion buyout of smart thermostat maker Nest.) But the enormity of the company’s recent purchases — in ambition, not just cost — has rewired my brain. From now on, I’m not going to be stunned by Facebook acquisitions, no matter how big. What’ll surprise me is if there are no more visionary, pricey deals where these two came from.

Already, he has dedicated himself to learning some Mandarin, marching through a talk in Chinese at a Beijing university. When Xi Jinping visited the U.S. last year, Zuckerberg chatted with the Chinese President. The Facebook founder has also hosted Lu Wei, China’s Internet chief, who has famously made it clear that any foreign firm hoping to enter the China market must play by Beijing’s rules. Over the weekend during a trip to Beijing for an economic conference, Zuckerberg continued his China charm campaign. On Saturday, he met with propaganda czar Liu Yunshan. More than anyone who sits on the seven-man Politburo Standing Committee that rules China, Liu decides what Chinese should think, read and experience through the media. A day earlier, despite the smog that blanketed Tiananmen Square, Zuckerberg posted a photo on Facebook of a run he took through the heart of the Chinese capital. Just down the Avenue of Eternal Peace, guards at the gates of the nation’s leadership compound were outfitted in protective face gear. But the tech tycoon wore no antipollution mask during his jog. China’s Internet pundits called Zuckerberg an “expensive vacuum cleaner” of toxic air pollution and christened Facebook with a new Chinese name, Fei Si Bu Ke (非死不可), which literally means “have to die.” Facebook could not be reached for comment. Facebook, of course, is banned in China, ever since 2009 race riots in the nation’s northwest spooked control-obsessed authorities. (Another Chinese Internet meme centered around how Zuckerberg was able to post his run on Facebook while in Beijing: the answer is a cumbersome and often expensive workaround called a virtual private network, or VPN.) The Chinese government is allergic to any digital technology that could be used to organize the masses outside of the authorities’ purview. Websites or keywords deemed politically sensitive are censored. YouTube, Google and Twitter are blocked by the Great Firewall. In their stead, domestic alternatives — such as Tencent’s WeChat, Sina’s Weibo and Baidu — have thrived. These Chinese services, though hugely popular with the nation’s nearly 670 million-strong digital population, submit to constant monitoring and censorship. A Baidu web search, for example, tends to ignore the 1989 massacre when the words Tiananmen Square are entered. Of course, not all Chinese companies have succeeded because of a lack of foreign competition. Alibaba, the tech behemoth behind online shopping platform Taobao, for instance, demolished eBay, which entered the China market with great fanfare and left utterly vanquished. Uber too has failed to grab significant market share from domestic car-hailing services, like Didi Kuaidi. The development of such local firms is crucial to China’s state-sanctioned efforts to encourage innovation. With the nation’s export-led growth slowing, its central planners want to move the economy up the value-added ladder. Earlier this month, at China’s annual parliamentary meeting, Premier Li Keqiang expanded on a so-called Internet Plus strategy, even as the government has cracked down on the kind of free expression associated with digital disruption. The government’s Internet policy is designed to incubate homegrown firms and discourage reliance on foreign companies. So how does a Western interloper such as Facebook fit in? The timing of Zuckerberg’s latest China foray is curious. Over the past few months, President Xi has put the brakes on free speech in China. He has advocated a global Internet governance network in which each country makes it own rules, as opposed to a system in which information freely flows across national borders. Earlier this month, the Chinese President toured the nation’s largest media outlets and reminded journalists that their primary allegiance was to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), not to the people or any fanciful notion that the press serves as a check on a government’s powers. Under Xi’s rule, hundreds of Chinese freethinkers have been detained or silenced. In just the latest example, a journalist disappeared last week, while a retired businessmen and CCP stalwart found his social-media account shuttered after criticizing Xi’s media tour. China’s official news service, Xinhua, characterized Zuckerberg’s meeting with propaganda chief Liu as less of a business deal and more of a courtesy call: “Liu expressed hope that Facebook, which has advanced technology and governance mode, should work with Chinese internet enterprises to enhance exchanges and share experience so as to make outcome of the internet development better benefit the people of all countries.” If Zuckerberg manages to convince Chinese officials to allow Facebook back in, he will almost assuredly have to accept a version of the social-media service that hews to local censorship rules. Perhaps Zuckerberg believes that Facebook lite is better than no Facebook at all. “China is like the legend of Excalibur to Silicon Valley CEOs, the sword in the stone,” says Duncan Clark, a Beijing-based tech analyst whose book Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built, will be published next month. “It’s tempting because it’s so hard. No one has cracked it.” For Zuckerberg, says Clark, “it’s hard to see how Facebook could achieve a meaningful market share as a new entrant in social in China, given the dominance of existing players like Tencent, let alone regulatory issues — managing their China operations to the satisfaction of the authorities in China, without falling foul of public opinion in the West or being grilled by the U.S. Congress.” Six years ago, Google took a different approach. After the company was put under mounting pressure to censor its search results, Google pulled out of mainland China. Critics sniped that Google was already losing ground to local competitor Baidu. But it’s also true that the U.S. firm turned its back on China precisely at the moment when so many others were desperate for a way in. This year, Google’s Play, a mobile-phone app store, could enter China. That could, in theory, help foreign gaming firms penetrate an untapped market. Yet earlier this year, Beijing unveiled further regulations that limit foreign or joint-venture companies from operating and publishing in the digital sphere. No amount of Mandarin lessons or Tiananmen jogs will change the reality of life behind the Great Firewall. Still, the business of tech can move faster than even notoriously fickle fashion cycles. “In tech, new opportunities open up,” says tech analyst Clark. “Even if existing areas like search or social are dominated by Baidu or Tencent, catching the next wave is a constant preoccupation.” Facebook, he says, “needs to be part of this massive market somehow.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3534248/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-chinese/", "http://time.com/3917721/the-other-side-of-the-great-firewall/", "http://time.com/4263917/mark-zuckerberg-china-smog-facebook-tiananmen/", "http://time.com/3917721/the-other-side-of-the-great-firewall/", "http://time.com/4230280/china-xi-jinping-poem-media/", "http://time.com/3954935/china-arrests-lawyers-human-rights/", "http://time.com/4265567/jia-jia-reporter-china-hong-kong/?xid=homepage", "http://time.com/4023367/google-china/"], "sentiment_score": 0.08041351010101012, "subjectivity_score": 0.36807810245310246},

Speaking to Wired, he revealed he didn’t know if the actor and mythic figure would actually do it. “We figured he would like the part we wrote for him, because it’s so different than what anyone would expect him to play in the movie. But it was always like, “Will we be able to get him?” I ran into him at the 40th anniversary Saturday Night Live party last year. He had already made that statement about who he thought should be in the movie, so it was on his radar; when I saw him, he was lovely, congratulating me on doing it and all that. And at the very end I said, “Well, Bill, we’d really love it if you would join us.” And he was all like, “Oh yeah, yeah…”, and just sort of extracted himself. So I was like, “Oh, no—did I blow it?” Murray, who has publicly approved of the casting and will cameo in the film said he had to think seriously about appearing in the film before he ultimately decided he was in. Murray famously doesn’t have an agent, and provides an 800 number for those who need to get in touch. Feig continued: “We were working it all from our backchannels, including calling that mystery number—I left this message, and I didn’t know where it went. It could have gone into a black hole, for all I knew, because it just clicks and you’re like, “Did I just get hung up on?” So we didn’t know. A couple of weeks before [shooting], we were like, “Should we be lining up someone else as a back-up, just in case?” What a terrible thing for an actor: “You’re hired, but if Bill Murray shows up, you’re fired.” With about a week to go, we heard, “It looks like he’s going to do it.” And when Bill came on the set, it was really emotional and completely nerve-racking.” Bill Murray may or may not be available for your wacky idea for an indie film, your parties, or your various Bill Murray-themed events, but you won’t know for sure until the last minute.

Before January, this startup specializing in outfitting commercial trucks with self-driving technology did not exist. Its expert employees were toiling away on autonomous vehicle projects at places like Google, Apple and Tesla. They left to start this venture, says cofounder and former Google Maps head Lior Ron, because they wanted to bring something to market “sooner rather than later.” And now, in a deal worth an estimated $680 million, the San Francisco-based Otto has become an independent division within Uber, another company “with that level of intensity and urgency and focus to start putting cars on a road, and not as an R&D exercise,” as Ron puts it, referring to research and development. There were other draws, too. Uber has formed its own expert team of robotics experts, many from Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Mellon University, to help launch self-driving cars that will ferry its users from A to B. With this deal, Uber may have acqui-hired Otto’s seasoned staff, but that staff is also clearly excited about having access to those minds in Pittsburgh. There’s also Uber’s wealth of data, which Ron describes as nothing short of historic. (“Just imagine tapping into the collective Uber brain of all the cars going on every road in every state in every kind of weather in every time of day,” he says.) And there is Uber’s know-how when it comes to building marketplaces, which is a key part of Otto’s vision. There are tens of millions of commercial trucks in America, and Otto wants to do for them what Uber does for users of its namesake app. Say someone wants to ship a couple tons of strawberries. Rather than contacting a broker, who then contacts a bunch of freelancing truckers–and charges a cut for hooking them up with a job and managing the details–people with trucks and people who need things shipped in trucks could connect through an app. And rather than waiting and wondering, the strawberry shipper could check in on the truck’s progress at any point, much like Uber users watch their cars inch closer in real-time thanks to GPS. “We’re presenting a whole new business unit for Uber in terms of the commercial transportation industry,” says Otto product manager Eric Berdinis, during a test drive on California’s Interstate 280 in one of the firm’s white Volvo big rigs. “And we have all Uber’s resources at our disposal to help bring that to the road faster.” The Otto team believes they can speed to market in the commercial trucking world in part because there are fewer problems to solve compared to passenger vehicles. For now, their aim is to outfit trucks to drive themselves solely “from exit to exit” on highways. And that means no city driving — no pedestrians, no traffic lights, no bicycles, no proverbial kid chasing his hoverboard into the street. And the company believes there is a much greater incentive for driverless tractor trailers to be widely adopted as fast as possible. “With a consumer vehicle, you’re paying out of pocket for some driver comfort,” says Berdinis, who used to work on wearable technology at Motorola, as the truck steers itself at the set limit of 55 mph. But outfitted with the right automation tech, truck drivers stand to lower their likelihood of crashes and thus save on insurance; to increase fuel efficiency by up to a third and save loads on gas; and to get way more use out of a very expensive asset that often sits idle because truck drivers have safety limits on how long their driving stretches can be. If, Berdinis says, the driver could put the truck in “cruising” mode, as they call it, and technically go off duty, getting some shut eye in the berth behind the driver’s seat, a truck could drive itself for hours—with the driver still collecting the usual rate per mile. But for now, drivers are still needed — not only to oversee the driving, but for all the things that happen either side of onramps and off-ramps, like the city driving and logistics, the docking and parking and weighing and so forth. “They’re still in the cabin,” Ron says. That’s the pitch, and Otto employees say that truck drivers are generally very receptive to it. While Uber is openly working to make Uber drivers obsolete—the first self-driving Ubers are set to go live in Pittsburgh in the coming months—Ron says that for “the foreseeable future” Otto intends to only be a “co-pilot” that helps drivers make a better living, while the company gets access to data from vehicles outfitted with its hardware. That will include in-house lasers the team is developing that provide 500-point 3D pictures of the environment, dozens of times per second, as well as more run-of-the-mill ultrasonic, radar and camera sensors. Otto plans to get its equipment on partners’ trucks for testing in the next 12 to 18 months. Will Uber take a cut from the commercial truck marketplace app, assuming it takes off? Will Otto sell its hardware for a profit or lease hardware by the mile so it’s affordable for a larger range of data-spewing vehicles? For now, the answers to those business model questions are “TBD.” And the technology is still learning to cope with all the factors highway driving still brings into play, especially when trucking along in an 18-wheeler. On our test drive, the human firmly planted in the truck’s driver’s seat took the wheel once when a broom popped up on the highway, and again when there was construction and he had to merge into thick traffic in the adjacent lane. To disengage, he hit a big red button on the dashboard. Meanwhile, a copilot sitting in the front passenger seat took notes so the engineering team could look at any elements that their algorithms weren’t already accounting for. In many ways, these drivers are out there, three shifts a day, looking for trouble. “We believe the best way to proceed is very real, versus being in the ivory tower and developing stuff for the sake of developing stuff,” says Ron, sitting in what is now a new Uber research facility plastered with Otto’s name. “It was always around acceleration. That’s why we started Otto. That’s why we’re focusing on trucks. That’s why we partnered with Uber.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4458385/uber-travis-kalanick-self-driving-cars-pittsburg/"], "sentiment_score": 0.10249709245977905, "subjectivity_score": 0.3631065451960975},

From a new user’s perspective, all three experiences felt mostly similar. I’m convinced that when these headsets start hitting the market next year, a winner will be crowned based on available content, not differences in underlying technology. But the Vive demo had something I hadn’t experienced yet, and it made the virtual reality experience much more immersive: VR-tuned controllers. Before I tried the Vive, my experiences in virtual reality were mostly hands-free. I could look around various digital domains, but actually interacting with the ersatz world around me was largely either impossible or meant using the same kind of controllers designed for traditional video games (or, worse, a keyboard and mouse). The Vive demo, however, featured new controllers that look a bit like a sword hilt, designed specifically to let users manipulate objects and other elements in virtual reality. What VR controllers actually let you do depends on the simulation you’ve got loaded up. In the demo I tried at a downtown New York City hotel on July 16, that meant a combination of clearing tiny fish out of the way of my scuba mask to get a better look at a humpback whale, grabbing the right ingredients out of a fridge and placing them in a pot to make soup, and failing miserably at rebuilding a broken robot. And all of these things felt incredibly natural and intuitive after just a minute or two. HTC’s Vive won’t have a monopoly on virtual reality controllers; the Facebook-owned Oculus has announced a pair of its own, too. That these companies realize the importance of actual interaction in virtual reality is great news for fans of the medium. While modern VR totally blew me away the first time I used it, I was getting a little bored by the concept come time to put the Vive on. But the controllers added an entirely new element that’s got me thinking about much more complex possibilities in the virtual space, like adventure games (virtual reality Myst, anyone?), puzzlers (VR Monument Valley, yes please) and action titles (VR Star Wars: Lightsaber Battle, shut up and take my money). Now, more than ever, I can’t wait to see the inevitably crazy ideas actual VR content creators cook up.

After 90 days of hearings and meetings with a wide range of civil rights groups and local police agencies, the Task Force on 21st Century Policing included the recommendation in its first report Monday. It notes that a 1994 law requires the Department of Justice to gather data about excessive force by police officers and publish an annual summary but notes that has never been done in a “serious and sustained” way. The report also suggests that local agencies adopt more of a community policing approach, minimize the use of military equipment at protests and rallies and have outside investigators look into police shootings. But it stopped short of endorsing widespread adoption of body cameras, an idea which first came up after a shooting in Ferguson, Mo. Task force members said that body cameras could be helpful but that privacy concerns need to be considered first. “Any technology we apply, we need to understand its usefulness,” said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, the co-chair of the task force, on a call with reporters Monday. “But we also need to make sure we’re working within a constitutional framework.” “Today we’re talking about body cameras, but tomorrow it will be something else,” Ramsey added. Marc Morial, president of the civil rights organization National Urban League, which called for more body cameras in testimony to the task force, praised the recommendations for independent investigators, but said that not coming down hard in favor of body and dashboard cameras a “missed opportunity.” “Privacy concerns that might be there are not enough to put the breaks on an idea whose time has come,” Morial tells TIME. Aside from the specific recommendations, the report stresses the need for police to establish trust and demonstrate transparency to the communities they serve. The task force makes some evergreen calls to action like engaging with community members and better addressing prejudice, while also calling on the federal government to take a hard look at criminal justice policies such as sentencing and reentry and societal issues like poverty and education that can further exacerbate police distrust. Many of the federal task force’s recommendations align with similar calls made by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which released a report on community-police relations in January. Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson of Gary, Ind., says that the report rightfully acknowledges that the federal government’s role in improving police-community relations is limited. “It acknowledges that while there can be guidance and training and technical assistance that can be provided at the federal level, there really has to be a local approach and a local commitment to addressing those concerns,” she said. Gene Voegtlin, a spokesman for the International Association of Chiefs of Police says, “This is more than just a police issue,” says “It’s a criminal justice system issue, and honestly probably a societal issue.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/interim_tf_report.pdf"], "sentiment_score": 0.07291908633372049, "subjectivity_score": 0.35619434765776226},

Over the course of his presidency, Barack Obama has created panels to study issues ranging from climate change to gun control to childhood obesity. Task forces are the place where hard-working people go to produce important work that winds up moldering on a shelf. Obama is determined to avoid this fate for his new White House panel on 21st century policing. “This is not going to be an endless report that ends up collecting dust,” the President pledged when he formed the task force in December after grand juries in New York and Ferguson, Mo., declined to charge two white police officers in the deaths of unarmed black men. The 11-member group is tasked with identifying concrete ways to mend the ruptured relationship between police and the communities they serve. It must present a draft report to Obama on March 2, recommending methods to strengthen public trust while reducing crime. Ron Davis, executive director of the task force and the director of the Department of Justice’s Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), says he is “extremely confident” the committee will live up to its promise. Davis told a panel held by the U.S. Conference of Mayors Thursday that the task force, which will hold a series of listening sessions, panel discussions and open forums over the next few weeks, had an opportunity to “redefine policing in a democratic society.” The mandate to do so comes from the top. Attorney General Eric Holder has seized police reform as a legacy issue. At Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Obama said he believes there is broad consensus to repair the rift between police forces and minority communities. “We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can’t walk home without being harassed,” the President said. “Surely we can understand the wife who won’t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. Surely we can agree it’s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America’s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all.” But channeling modest consensus into real change is a tall order—one made trickier by a grim drumbeat of bad feelings and worse news. The killing of two New York City police officers in late December sparked an ugly public dispute between the nation’s largest police force and its liberal mayor and may have led to a huge plummet in arrests. On Wednesday, new reports indicated federal authorities investigating the Aug. 9 death of Michael Brown have concluded there is insufficient evidence to charge Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting. A broader Department of Justice probe into the practices of the entire Ferguson police force is ongoing. “I’m realistic about what a task force is actually capable of,” says a person with knowledge of the task force proceedings, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about the committee’s challenges. “The task force can be very useful, but we are now in a place politically where actually creating legislation out of things will be an uphill battle.”  There are small signs of progress. In December, Congress passed a law requiring police departments to report the death of a person in police custody to the Justice Department. Obama has asked for $263 million in funding for new body cameras and training for police departments. He also ordered a review of a federal program that supplies millions of dollars of military equipment to municipal police departments. Several prominent Republicans, including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, have called for the party to address criminal-justice policies that harm minority communities. Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, a top conservative donor, is redoubling his efforts to enact criminal-justice reforms. The growing number of elected Republicans calling for justice reform has brightened the prospect of legislative action. On Thursday the Conference of Mayors released a report to help local law enforcement and politicians address the issue. “There’s a growing gulf of mistrust between police and communities they serve,” says Kevin Johnson, the mayor of Sacramento, Calif., and the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The report outlined six areas of focus, from building trust between cops and communities to addressing racial and economic disparities. Karen Freeman-Wilson, the mayor of Gary, Ind., and the chair of the mayoral working group that produced the report, argued the groundswell of anger in the aftermath of Ferguson offered a chance to address long-simmering tensions. “With every tragedy comes opportunity,” she says.  The report is full of sensible ideas, but short on concrete detail. And some of its specific suggestions drew immediate opposition. David Berger, the mayor of Lima, Ohio, bristled at the recommendation that police departments hand over responsibility for investigating officer-involved deaths to an independent official as a way to “increase public confidence.” Berger noted that Lima did just that in 2008, when police in that city shot a young mother to death and wounded her infant child after arriving at her home to arrest a companion on suspicion of drug dealing. The decision, he says, left the city unable to provide basic information about a case roiling the community, compounding the “dramatic trauma” caused by the incident. Davis said he couldn’t comment on the recommendations of the task force until its work wraps up in early March. Brittany Packnett, a St. Louis educator who was appointed to serve on the task force for her work organizing the Ferguson protests, said in an interview that she was optimistic about the panel and would focus on ensuring the street protests that followed Brown’s death led to concrete action. “I just don’t see us making progress if disruptive change and systemic change don’t go hand in hand,” she says. “I am trying to make sure the connection is fruitful.” Write to Alex Altman at alex_altman@timemagazine.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3648638/republicans-police-reform/"], "sentiment_score": 0.06390799015799013, "subjectivity_score": 0.4194557757057758},

The announcement should banish any doubt about Google’s plan to become a full-fledged Internet service provider. Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio, Salt Lake City, and San Jose were named as candidates for the company’s gigabit broadband service. The announcement comes after months of speculation about the location of Google’s next gigabit service foray. Over the last 18 months, Google, which for years denied that it was interested in becoming a broadband provider, announced Fiber initiatives in Kansas City, Austin, and Provo. What started out as a public shaming exercise has apparently turned into a real business, giving Google the confidence to announce an expansion plan. “We’ve long believed that the Internet’s next chapter will be built on gigabit speeds, so it’s fantastic to see this momentum,” the tech giant said in a blog post. “And now that we’ve learned a lot from our Google Fiber projects in Kansas City, Austin and Provo, we want to help build more ultra-fast networks. So we’ve invited cities in nine metro areas around the U.S. — 34 cities altogether — to work with us to explore what it would take to bring them Google Fiber.” (MORE: Here’s Why Your Netflix Is Slowing Down) In 2012, Google introduced its gigabit broadband service to the Kansas City metropolitan area, where 1-gigabit service costs $70 per month. For $120 per month, consumers get Google’s TV service in addition to gigabit speeds. The company also offers seven years of free Internet service at current (5 Mbps) speeds, after a $300 installation fee, or $25 per month. Google says its fiber-to-the-home product provides customers with broadband-Internet speeds of 1 gigabit per second — roughly 100 times faster than the average U.S. connection — as well as crystal-clear television service. “We aim to provide updates by the end of the year about which cities will be getting Google Fiber,” the company said. “Between now and then, we’ll work closely with each city’s leaders on a joint planning process that will not only map out a Google Fiber network in detail, but also assess what unique local challenges we might face.” It’s important to stress that Google hasn’t announced that it will actually deploy its gigbit fiber service to the new cities. Rather, the company says it’s going to “work on a detailed study of local factors that could affect construction, like topography (e.g., hills, flood zones), housing density and the condition of local infrastructure.” Sadly for East Coasters, New York, Boston, and Washington did not make the list. When Google Fiber was announced, many observers believed the company’s goal would be to shame the incumbent telecom and cable giants into improving their offerings, by demonstrating that vastly faster service is possible in the U.S. But Google appears to be serious about turning Fiber into a real business. Improving U.S. broadband speed and penetration is important for Google, because the more people who use broadband Internet, at faster speeds, the more Google searches get executed, which translates into more revenue for the company.

Hastings made his comments in a blog post one month after Netflix struck a deal with Comcast to connect their networks directly to improve service for consumers. Hastings’ comments are the latest salvo in the multi-year battle over “net neutrality,” the idea enshrined in the now-defunct U.S. Open Internet rules that prohibited major Internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from favoring some online services at the expense of rivals. Hastings’ blog post provoked a quick response from Comcast, which declared that no company has had a “stronger commitment to openness of the Internet than Comcast.” Here’s the question: Should paid peering agreements between Internet content companies, bandwidth providers and broadband service providers be covered by net neutrality rules? In its 2010 Open Internet order, which was struck down by a federal judge in January, the Federal Communications Commission made clear that wasn’t the case. The timing of Hastings’ post is not arbitrary: Friday is the deadline for filing comments in the FCC’s Open Internet docket, which is designed to remedy the recent court defeat. The FCC’s order, which only applies to the “last mile” connection into consumers’ homes, specifically exempted “existing arrangements for network interconnection, including existing paid peering arrangements,” which means that the interconnection deal struck by Comcast and Netflix last month is not covered by the rules. Still, some net neutrality advocates want to make paid peering deals a net neutrality issue, and Hastings appears to be appealing to that constituency. In his blog post, Hastings drew a contrast between what he called “weak” net neutrality, which is how he described the FCC’s recently overturned rules, and “strong” net neutrality,” which he said would prevent ISPs from “charging a toll for interconnection to services like Netflix, YouTube, or Skype, or intermediaries such as Cogent, Akamai or Level 3, to deliver the services and data requested by ISP residential subscribers.” Internet service providers, Hastings asserted, “must provide sufficient access to their network without charge.” That proposition is anathema to the nation’s largest ISPs, which for years have expressed displeasure that they are obliged to deliver high bandwidth content — which often competes with their own video offerings — over the infrastructure they’ve spent billions of dollars to build. By suggesting that the nation’s largest Internet service providers connect Netflix to consumers “without charge,” the online video service is asking for special treatment, the ISPs say. In his blog post, Hastings did not identify a policy solution to his company’s problem. One option would be for the FCC to reclassify broadband as a “telecommunications” service, which would allow it to establish “common carrier” regulations prohibiting the broadband giants from discriminating against rival services. It’s unclear whether this so-called “Title II” reclassification is what Hastings had in mind when he referred to “strong” net neutrality. A Netflix spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment from TIME seeking clarification. Hastings did say that Netflix is willing to pay ISPs for better service for consumers. Neither Netflix nor Comcast will disclose the financial details of their interconnection agreement, but Netflix has said that the amount is not “material” to its bottom line. But that’s just for Comcast. Netflix is concerned that now that it’s struck that deal, other ISPs like AT&T and Verizon will demand a similar amount, which could add up quickly. It’s no wonder Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has buyer’s remorse. Despite the fact that paid peering agreements have been a standard feature of the Internet’s behind-the-scenes architecture for many years — and were explicitly allowed by the FCC — Netflix now wants to frame such deals in terms of net neutrality. “Some big ISPs are extracting a toll because they can — they effectively control access to millions of consumers and are willing to sacrifice the interests of their own customers to press Netflix and others to pay,” Hastings wrote. “Netflix believes strong net neutrality is critical, but in the near term we will in cases pay the toll to the powerful ISPs to protect our consumer experience.” For its part, Comcast bristled at the suggestion that it was extracting an unjust “tax” from Netflix. “The Open Internet rules never were designed to deal with peering and Internet interconnection, which have been an essential part of the growth of the Internet for two decades,” David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice president, said in a statement. “Providers like Netflix have always paid for their interconnection to the Internet and have always had ample options to ensure that their customers receive an optimal performance through all ISPs at a fair price.” Netflix’s net neutrality outburst comes as federal and state regulators are scrutinizing Comcast’s proposed $45 billion deal to buy Time Warner Cable, which would create a broadband titan with unprecedented market power. (Time Warner Cable was spun off from TIME parent Time Warner in 2009.) As part of the proposed Time Warner Cable deal, Comcast will extend the commitment it made during its NBCUniversal review to abide by open Internet principles until 2018. The latest flare-up between Netflix and Comcast underscores the ongoing shift in the commercial architecture of the Internet as consumers use increasing amounts of bandwidth. It also highlights the growing leverage held by broadband giants like Comcast in negotiations with content companies like Netflix. After the FCC’s Open Internet rules were struck down, the nation’s largest Internet companies were plunged into a period of uncertainty. It’s now up to the FCC to decide how it wants to proceed, and whether paid peering deals like the one struck by Comcast and Netflix will be covered by its rules.

Comcast should not be permitted to buy smaller rival Time Warner Cable in a $45 billion deal now being scrutinized by U.S. regulators, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings argued in a letter to shareholders, because the cable giant is already too powerful. It’s the second time in a month that Hastings has attacked Comcast, following a controversial deal in which the streaming video company agreed to pay for a direct connection to the nation’s largest broadband provider. “Comcast is already dominant enough to be able to capture unprecedented fees from transit providers and services such as Netflix,” Hastings wrote. “The combined company would possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers.” Comcast’s response was swift. The broadband giant accused Netflix of using “net neutrality“—the principle enshrined in the now-defunct U.S. Open Internet rules that prohibited Internet service providers from favoring some online services—as a pretext for advancing its own commercial interests. In essence, Comcast says that Netflix is taking advantage of regulatory scrutiny of the Time Warner Cable deal to try to make interconnection deals—standard business arrangements that have existed between Internet and broadband companies for years—a net neutrality issue. And it’s doing this, according to Comcast, to bolster its own bottom line. “Internet interconnection has nothing to do with net neutrality,” Comcast wrote in a company blog post. “It’s all about Netflix wanting to unfairly shift its costs from its customers to all Internet customers, regardless of whether they subscribe to Netflix or not.” In its 2010 Open Internet order, which was struck down by a federal judge in January, the Federal Communications Commission made clear that interconnection deals were not subject to the net neutrality rules. As part of its deal with Comcast, Netflix gained a direct connection to the nation’s largest broadband company, bypassing bandwidth providers that operate as intermediaries between residential broadband companies and Internet firms. The agreement is already benefitting Netflix customers who subscribe to Comcast broadband service. Last week, Netflix said that streaming speeds to Comcast users had increased by 65% between January and March. Comcast says that if Netflix is not happy with their interconnection pact, it’s free to terminate the pact. “If Netflix did not like the terms of our agreement, or if they do not like the terms Comcast provides at any time in the future, Netflix can work with any of the multiplicity of partners that connect with Comcast,” the broadband giant wrote. Comcast pointed out that “Netflix approached us for this direct connection between Netflix and Comcast, cutting out the wholesalers with whom Netflix had traditionally contracted and paid for transit. This arrangement was thus about Netflix exercising its market power to extract a more favorable arrangement directly from Comcast than what Netflix had been paying for through third party providers.” “Netflix is free to express its opinions,” Comcast concluded. “But they should be factually based. And Netflix should be transparent that its opinion is not about protecting the consumer or about Net Neutrality. Rather, it’s about improving Netflix’s business model by shifting costs that it has always borne to all users of the Internet and not just to Netflix customers.” Paid interconnection agreements have been a common feature of the Internet’s behind-the-scenes architecture for many years, but now Netflix wants to frame such deals in terms of net neutrality. Moving forward, the FCC will decide whether deals like the one struck by Comcast and Netflix will be covered by the Open Internet rules. As of now, that’s not the case. Dan Rayburn, principal analyst at Frost & Sullivan and executive vice president of StreamingMedia.com, says Netflix arguments against Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable aren’t valid. “This argument between Netflix and Comcast about interconnection deals has nothing to do with net neutrality,” Rayburn wrote on Monday. “This isn’t about ‘fighting for the Internet the world needs,’ like Netflix has said, it’s about keeping their costs down.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/70860/netflix-price-increase-coming-soon/", "http://time.com/32784/netflix-comcast-net-neutrality/", "http://time.com/54687/comcast-twc-congress-hearing-senate/", "http://time.com/32784/netflix-comcast-net-neutrality/", "http://time.com/9373/comcast-netflix-deal/", "http://time.com/32784/netflix-comcast-net-neutrality/", "https://time.com/71465/comcast-netflix-feud/controversial", "http://time.com/62903/netflix-comcast-speed-boost/"], "sentiment_score": 0.07844444444444446, "subjectivity_score": 0.47422222222222216},

Aereo, which launched in February 2012, uses thousands of dime-sized antennas to pick up free, over-the-air TV signals, which it sends to customers over the Internet for a monthly fee starting at $8. The startup has infuriated the major broadcasters, including NBC, FOX, ABC and CBS, which sued the company right after it launched, charging that the service is illegal because it doesn’t pay to pick up the signals it streams to users. The broadcasters have warned that if Aereo prevails, they could yank their primetime shows from free TV and move them to pay channels like Showtime. The National Football League and Major League Baseball have threatened to take high-profile broadcasts like the Super Bowl and World Series to cable. The outcome of the case could have significant ramifications for the future of Internet streaming, cloud computing, and the TV industry itself. The broadcasters, which last month filed their brief with the Supreme Court, say that Aereo’s service amounts to theft because the company doesn’t pay “retransmission fees,” unlike cable and satellite providers, which fork over billions for the right to offer popular TV programming to their subscribers. Aereo’s response brief is due on March 26 and oral arguments are set for April 22. (MORE: The 6 Most Important Tech Bombshells Coming This Year) Last year, federal courts in New York and Boston agreed with Aereo’s argument that it is transmitting legally protected “private performances” to individual users over their own leased antennas, based on principles established by the 2008 Cablevision decision, which allowed remote-storage DVR technology. But last month, a federal judge in Utah sided with the broadcasters, increasing the urgency for a Supreme Court resolution. On Monday, Aereo, which already operates in 13 cities, will launch its service in Austin, Texas, just days before Austin’s SXSW Interactive technology conference. In the interview, Kanojia, who sold his previous company, Navic Networks, a developer of TV advertising technology, to Microsoft in 2008 for a reported $250 million, described the origins of Aereo, how the service works and why he believes it is legal. Kanojia also discussed the consequences for technology innovation if Aereo loses, the broadcasters’ threat to move their shows to cable, and controversial comments made by a federal judge who described Aereo as a “sham” and a “Rube Goldberg-like contrivance.” The interview, which was conducted by phone, has been lightly condensed and edited for clarity. TIME: What was your inspiration for starting Aereo? Kanojia: At my previous company, we saw that the pattern of TV usage was that people had hundreds of channels on their cable boxes but only watched seven or eight channels in a given household. And at any given time, 50% of the usage was broadcast television, including local and network broadcasts, which is obviously available using an antenna, so that’s kind of when the lightbulb started going on. We saw that there’s a lot of waste in front of the consumer, and that consumers are always unhappy with the value and price they get out of the traditional television packaging model. If you ask people how many love their cable company, the only people who say yes work for the cable company. So we knew there was an opportunity to serve consumers differently. If you could make a smart antenna that gets consistent reception for consumers, which they could access online and use on any device, they could get it for a fraction of the price that they are today forced to pay [for cable]. And as people’s media habits are changing, they could combine that on the same device with a Netflix or Hulu subscription. That would be a winning proposition for people because the combination would be $16 to $20 per month versus the $200 they had been paying. TIME: How does Aereo work from a technical standpoint? Kanojia: Anyone can go out and buy an antenna and stick it on their roof, and if they have a good line of sight to the transmission location they can pick up the signal. What we do is miniaturize the antenna to the size of a dime so we can pack hundreds of thousands of them into a small location, and then lease the consumer an antenna, just placed remotely. So each consumer gets their own antenna, and then they decide what they want to watch. We lease the technology to the consumer, and then the consumer decides if, when and how they choose to tune in to whatever channel they want. The pitch to the consumer is simple: The antenna is just placed remotely, and nothing else has changed. TIME: U.S. Judge Denny Chin was the lone dissenter in the Second Circuit, and called Aereo a “sham” and a “Rube Goldberg-like contrivance.” What did you think of that statement? Kanojia: That was an unfortunate characterization, in my opinion. Based on the Cablevision remote DVR verdict, a one-to-one relationship between the consumer’s copy or the antenna driving the stream to the consumer is what the law requires. We looked at that verdict and set out to comply with the law to the fullest extent possible, and we created a great technology that is solving a real consumer problem and bringing choice to the marketplace. It’s been proven that the technology functions as we describe it, and we’re proud of the fact that we engineered a technology to serve a consumer purpose that is fully compliant with the law. TIME: Why is Aereo legal? Explain why the service is a “private performance.” Kanojia: Nobody disputes the fact that a customer can have an antenna. Nobody disputes the fact that a customer can make a recording for herself or himself in their home, and as a result of the Cablevision case, they can make a recording in a remote location as well. Nobody is disputing that this system or combination of technologies that lots of companies sell today and make a profit on is perfectly legitimate. The debate is about how long the wire is between the user and the source of their recordings. What the Second Circuit found in the Cablevision case — and the Second Circuit found that Aereo prevails on its merits as well — was that when a customer creates their copy and streams it to themselves under their own volition, and can decide whenever and however to do it, that constitutes private conduct. The stream that originates from that private conduct under their private control is a private performance. Let’s say I have a multi-room DVR that is sitting in my basement, and I’ve got six wires coming out of it going to six different rooms. I am streaming that content to myself and that’s a private performance. The relationship between the stream or the copy to the viewer is a one-to-one relationship at all times. TIME: What would be the broader consequences for innovation and technology if Aereo loses the case? Kanojia: The biggest impact would be on cloud computing in general, and specifically, cloud-based storage services. Here’s an example. You recorded a show off of your antenna and you’d like to be able to watch it on any device you want. The same goes for a piece of music or an e-book. It doesn’t really matter what the media is, the statute covers everything. Then you say I’m going to take all this stuff that I legitimately acquired, because I have the right to [receive] broadcast television and I purchased this song and I purchased this e-book, and I put it in my Google Drive, which is a cloud-based storage solution. Then I choose to stream it to myself whenever I want. That would be deemed illegal if Aereo is not legal. That would be very serious. This is where we have a little bit of faith and confidence, because historically, technology has moved the needle forward and created more opportunities for everybody involved, and we have the same belief here. If Aereo is continued to be allowed to operate, it will create more opportunitiesfor everybody. Here’s another example. Cable companies today are building out network DVRs, whether it’s Comcast, Cablevision or others. Why? Because it’s a heck of lot more cost-effective for them, and it results in a better experience for the to have a network DVR. Throughout the process, the courts didn’t find that there was any distinction between Cablevision’s technology and Aereo’s technology from a factual perspective. So that means if Aereo is not allowed to continue, neither are network DVRs, which would be a huge step backwards for a lot of these industries. TIME: Some broadcasting executives have warned that if Aereo prevails, they might pull free, over-the-air TV signals and move popular programming to cable? What do you make of that? Kanojia: I don’t believe that to be a serious threat, just from a business perspective. According to the NAB [National Association of Broadcasters], there are nearly 60 million people who are using over-the-air access. So the networks would have to make a business decision that they are willing to cut off 60 million people. Are they going to disenfranchise 60 million people just because they want to make more money, notwithstanding the fact that 90% of their revenue is advertising? Nielsen has said it is beginning to measure the audience of technologies like Aereo, in terms of the audience they bring. They would be ignoring the fact that Aereo is helping them increase their audience, because last I checked no 25-year-old is running out to sign up for a cable connection. But with Aereo they are watching quality television, and they have a legitimate way to get that television without resorting to piracy, because these people aren’t interested in paying a $200 bill. Most importantly, they would essentially be killing local broadcasting because local broadcasting depends on network television to bring it an audience. So from a business imperative, a business rationale, and their mandate to program in the public interest, they would be running afoul of all of these things, so I don’t find that argument persuasive at all. TIME: Do you think Aereo will prevail in the Supreme Court? Kanojia: It would be inappropriate for me to forecast anything or presume anything, but we think the logic that we have laid out is very compelling, sound logic. We are confident in the merits of our position and we are eager to find out what the Supreme Court thinks.

The price hike, which the company says will amount to $1 or $2 per month, will take place sometime from April to June. The increase will only affect new members for now. Netflix says current members will be able to keep their current plans for one to two years. The company is being rightly cautious in increasing subscription rates. Its 2011 attempt to generate more revenue by separating its DVD-by-mail and streaming services into separate businesses was disastrous for Netflix’s brand and its stock price. Since then the company has earned back credibility with customers by bankrolling a growing stable of original shows and inking licensing deals with big entertainment companies like Disney. But this content comes at a great cost — Netflix will spend almost $3 billion licensing shows and movies this year. The company needs both more subscribers and more revenue per subscriber to keep its business profitable as acquisition costs soar. “If we want to continue to expand to do more great original content, more series, more movies, we have to eventually increase prices a little bit,” CEO Reed Hastings said in a video conference with analysts. “You’re talking about a dollar or two difference per month, so I don’t think that it’s a huge difference.” The news of a price hike comes as Netflix continues to add new subscribers at a rapid pace. The company added 4 million new members in the first quarter of 2014, bringing its total subscriber base to more than 48 million globally. The additions were above Netflix’s guidance of 3.85 million new members for the quarter thanks to a surge in international subscriptions. Netflix generated $1.27 billion in revenue for the quarter, in line with analyst estimates. Net income was $53 million, topping $3 million in the first quarter of 2013. Earnings were 86¢ per share, beating analyst targets by 3¢. Netflix also used its earnings report to formally oppose the planned merger between Time Warner Cable and Comcast that is currently under scrutiny from federal regulators. The online video service recently reached a deal to pay Comcast for a direct connection to its broadband network in order to ensure faster streaming speeds for its users. But the company has publicly complained that this type of paid-peering agreement is unfair and violates the principles of net neutrality (broadband providers feel different). Netflix fears a combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which would serve about 60% of U.S. broadband households, would be able to charge even more for such fees. “Comcast is already dominant enough to be able to capture unprecedented fees from transit providers and services such as Netflix,” the company wrote in a letter to shareholders. “The combined company would possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers.” The company continues to be coy in revealing precise viewership numbers for its expensive original shows, allowing only that Season 2 of House of Cards attracted “a huge audience that would make any cable or broadcast network happy,” according to Netflix’s shareholder letter. Chief content officer Ted Sarandos also confirmed that Orange Is the New Black remains the most popular original show on the streaming service. Netflix stock jumped more than 6% in after-hours trading. It’s still down significantly from its all-time high of $458 in early March as part of an overall decline in the tech sector over the past month.

The proposed merger, which would combine the two largest cable companies in the U.S. and create an unprecedented entertainment and communications colossus, is fiercely opposed by many consumer advocacy groups. Critics of the deal say the merger would concentrate too much market power in the hands of a single media giant, potentially harming competitors and offering scant benefits for consumers. On Tuesday, more than 50 public interest groups sent a letter to the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission in which they called the deal “unthinkable” and urged U.S. regulators to block it. The intense debate about the proposed merger underscores the rapid changes sweeping across the media landscape as broadband Internet service becomes the signature communications medium of the 21st century. Tens of millions of Americans communicate, conduct business, and consume content using Internet-based technologies like email, instant messaging, video chat, social networks, voice-over-IP phone service, and streaming entertainment options like Netflix, Amazon and Spotify. Federal approval of the deal would amount to a resounding triumph for Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, whose father founded the company in 1963 by buying a 1,200-subscriber cable TV company in Tupelo, Miss. for $500,000. Comcast, which now employs 136,000 people and has a market value of $130 billion, already owns NBCUniversal, one of the crown jewels of the entertainment industry, after buying the company from industrial conglomerate General Electric. On Wednesday, Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and argued that the deal won’t harm competitors or consumers. On the contrary, Cohen said the deal is actually great for consumers, who will benefit from faster Internet speeds, enhanced broadband services, and improved user interface technology. Comcast has also pledged to extend its “net neutrality” commitment to Time Warner Cable customers, and expand a program that pushes broadband access in low income areas into Time Warner Cable markets. (MORE: Comcast’s Time Warner Cable Deal is ‘Unthinkable,’ Critics Say) Several lawmakers have expressed concern about the deal, including Sen. Al Franken (D—Mn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. “I have serious reservations about this proposed transaction, which would consolidate the largest and second largest cable providers in America,” Franken wrote in a recent letter to regulators. “Unfortunately, a handful of cable providers dominate the market, leaving consumers with little choice but to pay high bills for often unsatisfactory service. I am concerned that Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner would only make things worse for consumers.” On Tuesday, Comcast filed its 180-page Public Interest Statement with the FCC, which is charged with ensuring that the deal serves the public interest. “We expect a rigorous review as we’ve had in our previous deals, and believe an objective weighing of the significant public interest benefits that are offered by this transaction and the lack of competitive concerns should lead to approval,” Cohen wrote in a corporate blog post. If the deal is approved, Comcast would command nearly 40% of the high speed wire line broadband Internet market in the U.S. Critics say that allowing one company to control the pipes bringing high-speed Internet access into the homes of four out of ten U.S. broadband subscribers would give Comcast an alarming amount of power over consumers and competitors alike. (Time Warner Cable was spun off from TIME parent Time Warner in 2009.) Cohen dismisses such concerns. “This transaction is all about increasing competition and creating more consumer benefit as a result of gaining additional scale,” he said in a recent interview with C-SPAN. Comcast says that the deal isn’t anticompetitive because the two companies don’t compete for cable customers in the same markets. “Customers will still have the same number of video, broadband, or phone options before the deal as after it,” Cohen wrote in the blog post. Comcast says the deal will help it address competitive threats not just from traditional phone and satellite firms like AT&T, Verizon, DirecTV, and DISH, but also from Internet companies like Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook. “Internet and device companies, with newfound global scale, also are competing aggressively in the video marketplace and in the larger broadband value circle,” Cohen wrote, pointing to initiatives like Google Fiber, Apple TV, and Amazon’s recently announced Fire TV set-top box. One thing that Comcast is not promising is lower prices for consumers. “We’re certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly,” Cohen told reporters when the deal was announced. The implication of this statement is that any cost savings that Comcast is able to achieve, either through increased scale or enhanced buying power, would go directly to the company’s bottom line or be invested back into the business. It’s possible, but by no means certain, that such investment will benefit consumers, through advances in broadband speed and technology. But the people most likely to benefit from of any enhancement of Comcast’s already formidable competitive position in the marketplace will surely be the company’s shareholders.

Also among the detained is Fengrui lawyer Zhou Shifeng, former counsel to the journalist Zhang Miao, who was imprisoned for nearly nine months after covering Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement for Die Zeit. The Post reports that as of Monday morning, police had released 82 of the 106 detainees, though several attorneys were rearrested.

The proposed merger of the two largest cable companies in the United States has attracted criticism from public interest groups who say that the deal would concentrate too much market power in the hands of one company. Along with the Justice Department, which will address antitrust concerns, the merger faces scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, which is charged with ensuring that the deal serves the public interest. Comcast maintains that the deal isn’t anticompetitive because the two companies don’t compete in the same markets, and says the merger will result in improved service for consumers. Some 25 states are currently participating in the multistate group reviewing the proposed transaction, according to a person familiar with the probe. Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen’s office is part of the group, a spokesperson for Jepsen confirmed to TIME. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s office is also participating. “We are part of a multistate group reviewing the proposed transaction along with the U.S. DOJ Antitrust Division,” a spokesperson for Bondi said in an emailed statement. California Attorney General Kamala Harris’s office is also part of the multistate review group, according to a person familiar with the matter. Harris’s office declined to comment. New York is not part of the multistate review group at this time, a spokesperson told TIME. A spokesperson for Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said he “cannot confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of an investigation.” Indiana officials are also examining the deal to determine “the potential impact in Indiana,” a spokesperson told Reuters, which first reported the states probes. Pennsylvania, where Comcast is headquartered, is “reviewing the case independently,” a spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office told Reuters. A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the federal antitrust probe, but declined to comment on the multistate review group. Combining Comcast and Time Warner Cable would create a corporate giant with approximately 33 million pay-TV customers and about one-third of the U.S. broadband Internet market. Comcast already owns NBCUniversal, after buying the media company from industrial conglomerate General Electric. As part of the proposed Time Warner Cable deal, Comcast will extend the commitment it made during the NBCUniversal review to abide by open-Internet principles until 2018. Major entertainment and content companies that sell programming to cable and satellite companies have expressed concern that the merger could create a powerful gatekeeper with unprecedented buying power in the market. This could give the combined company what economists call “monopsony” power, which is one buyer with many sellers, as opposed to “monopoly” power, which is one seller with many buyers. Such monopsony power could have benefits for consumers, because the combined company would have increased leverage in contentious negotiations with the TV broadcasters over “retransmission consent fees,” which cable and satellite companies pay for the right to carry popular programming like prime-time shows and sports. That could mean downward pressure on prices for consumers, but only if the combined company chose to pass those savings on to them, which is by no means certain. Retransmission consent fees were at the heart of last year’s dispute between CBS and Time Warner Cable, which led to an unprecedented, monthlong CBS blackout for more than 3 million Time Warner Cable subscribers in New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas. Time Warner Cable, which was spun off from TIME parent Time Warner in 2009, is an attractive takeover target because of its major presence in several important markets, including New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas, as well as large portions of Ohio, North Carolina and Maine. In order to help assuage regulators, Comcast has said it’s willing to jettison as many as 3 million subscribers in order to make sure the new company does not exceed 30% of the cable market. Comcast declined to comment on the state probes, but it’s worth noting that these state attorneys general reviews are typical for a proposed merger of this size, because the deal has the potential to affect millions of consumers across the country. During the review process for Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal, some 14 states participated.

{"type": "article", "header": "The Growing Republican Divide on Criminal Justice Reform", "author": "Alex Altman", "update_date/publish_date": "December 29, 2014 2:56 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/3648638/republicans-police-reform/", "text": "Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialist and Republican Party donor, says he will make criminal justice reform a major cause in 2015. “Over the next year, we are going to be pushing the issues key to this, which need a lot of work in this country,” Koch said in an interview with the Wichita Eagle. Koch is a big spender—and something of a bogeyman among many liberals—so this made news. The “conservative mega-donor,” a Politico story blared, “is opening his wallet on an unexpected issue.” Except it shouldn’t be unexpected. Koch is a libertarian, and libertarians have a history of opposing policies, such as mandatory minimum sentencing, that have made the U.S. incarceration rate the highest in the world. What’s perhaps more surprising is how Republican politicians from other parts of the spectrum are beginning to embrace criminal justice reform as well. Over the past few years, GOP leaders in Washington and around the country have seized on justice reform as an issue that is both good policy and good politics. This view places them in conflict with many Republican voters, who still hew to the law-and-order beliefs on which the party had long been united. As a result, criminal-justice policy may emerge as one of the GOP’s key fault lines in 2015, as tensions simmer amid ongoing protests over police behavior and the presidential primary begins to heat up. Virtually all of the likely 2016 Republican field supports some element of criminal-justice reform. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is the most visible and least surprising proponent; as a libertarian-leaning conservative, he has staked his candidacy on the idea that the GOP must adjust its policies as the composition of the electorate changes. But Paul is hardly the only 2016 hopeful to plant a flag on the issue. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor, has called for an end to the “failed war on drugs” and signed legislation that sent some offenders to rehab instead of prison. Rick Perry, the conservative governor of Texas, has been among the nation’s top prison reformers, even winning a national award for his support of drug courts as an alternative to incarceration. Louisiana’s Bobby Jindal, another Republican governor eyeing a 2016 bid, pushed legislation that would boost the state’s drug rehab program and make some nonviolent offenders eligible for early release. Conservatives in Congress also have an appetite for reform. Paul Ryan produced a white paper on poverty that includes proposals like giving judges sentencing flexibility for nonviolent offenders and letting some inmates earn time off their prison stays for successful participation in programs. Mike Lee, a Republican senator from Utah and a Tea Party favorite, was one of the original sponsors, with liberal senators Dick Durbin and Pat Leahy, of a bill called the Smarter Sentencing Act, which attempts to curtail the draconian sentencing that has left some 2.2 million Americans behind bars. Among the Republicans who have since signed on: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, another presidential hopeful. Why have Republicans come around on law-and-order issues? Part of it is politics. As the country grows younger and more diverse, GOP leaders grasp the need to reach out to the minority groups who are disproportionately affected by the excesses of the justice system. It’s no surprise that Ryan, who knows firsthand how a lack of minority support can erode the viability of the Republican presidential ticket, spent time touring inner cities after 2012—nor that Paul, who hopes to avoid the same fate in ’16, launched a listening tour of his own. There is also, Republicans note, a conservative case for overhauling a bloated prison system that drains resources and divides families. “You want to talk about real conservative governance? Shut prisons down. Save that money,” Perry said. A group called Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty inveighs against the failures of capital punishment, a process riddled with “waste, inaccuracy and bias” that “does not square up with conservative ideology.” But the GOP base—which is older and whiter and wealthier than the average America, and thus less likely to be ensnared by the system—has been slower to embrace these ideas. And the bitter national debate catalyzed by the recent deaths of black men like Michael Brown and Eric Garner looks likely to impede the process. Police behavior is a different thing than, say, eliminating mandatory minimums for nonviolent offenders—a point on which even the majority of Republicans agree. But the debate has revealed the degree to which law-and-order attitudes dominate in Republican circles. Polls reveal that perspectives on police behavior break along partisan lines almost as sharply as racial ones. If Republicans are less likely to accept the prevalence of police misconduct (and they are), it follows that they would be less likely to buy into the notion that the system requires reform. In a recent Washington Post-ABC News survey, eight in 10 white Republicans said the Brown and Garner cases were isolated incidents, and a similar percentage say they are “confident that police treat blacks and whites equally.” As long as support for cops stays sacrosanct among primary voters, criminal-justice reform is unlikely to become a campaign rallying cry during the GOP primary, even in a field that predominantly supports it. The Republican Party is evolving on criminal justice. But politicians will still talk on the trail about what voters want to hear.

The object of his ardor was Chinese President and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping, who on Friday visited the offices of Xinhua, as well as those of the party mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, and CCTV, the national broadcaster. Xi’s news tour was given blanket coverage by state media, which posted photos of the nation’s leader trying out the anchor’s chair at CCTV and smiling over a Xinhua news desk decorated with a bank of landline phones. Three hours after Pu published the poem on his personal WeChat social-media account, his paean had garnered 20,000 hits. (A previous poem Pu posted the day before only received 314 hits.) On its Twitter feed, Xinhua noted that Xi gave reporters a few tips, like encouraging “journalists to write stories that ‘people like to read.’” While Twitter is blocked in China by state censors, state media like Xinhua are prolific users of the social-media service, often posting pictures of indolent pandas, comely female soldiers and the occasional cute cat. President #XiJinping visits headquarters of Xinhua News Agency in Beijing. Xinhua is China's national news agency pic.twitter.com/LNTN9Df4E6 China’s journalists are subject to intense censorship, with editors receiving daily directives on what topics have been deemed taboo. Self-censorship is rampant. While a few enterprising newspapers gained fame for their muckraking after the turn of the century, their exposés have waned in recent years, as liberal editors have been sacked and investigative reporters punished. In 2015, China had the largest number of journalists behind bars of any nation, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Several imprisoned reporters have been paraded on state TV to confess to their purported crimes. Read Next: The Other Side of the Great Firewall Xi’s media tour comes as China published new rules that, if read literally, could block any foreign or joint-venture company from publishing online content “of informational or thoughtful nature” within mainland China without prior government approval. It is unclear how these regulations, which go into effect on March 10, will affect the operations of local-language sites run by international media, like Dow Jones or Bloomberg. Xi, who took the nation’s helm in late 2012, has called for China to protect its online sphere from unwanted foreign influences. He advocates national law trumping free flow of information across state borders — a concept known as Internet sovereignty. As the Chinese President steps up a crackdown on independent thinkers — Beijing has detained hundreds of lawyers, writers and NGO workers in recent months — his government has also railed against so-called Western values, like freedom of the press and a vigorous civil society. Chinese universities have been warned against allowing such pernicious foreign values to infect young minds. Meanwhile, the People’s Daily has increased its coverage of the Chinese leader, whose front-page mentions have far eclipsed those of his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, according to a survey by the University of Hong Kong’s China Media Project. But as adulatory as these stories may be, few are as fawning as Pu’s poem, which ends with these rousing verses: General Secretary, your back and my gaze,\nYou march on with vigorous steps and rising head\nWe will continue singing loudly and walking fast\nOn the road to a well-off society\nCloser and closer to that dream\nThere will be troubles and shadows on the way\nJust keep calm, like this noon\nThe haze can’t hide the bright and clean sky General Secretary, your back and my gaze\nThe admiring gazes are from me and numerous Xinhua staff — With reporting by Yang Siqi / Beijing Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3917721/the-other-side-of-the-great-firewall/"], "sentiment_score": 0.07013164431197219, "subjectivity_score": 0.36414555389965236},

This apparently didn’t discourage Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg from taking a spirited jog through the capital city’s Tiananmen Square, an excursion he documented and shared on Facebook on Friday. “It’s great to be back in Beijing!” Zuckerberg wrote in the caption accompanying the photo. He’s grinning as he runs, seemingly undeterred by the grey soupy haze that shrouds the vast concrete plain behind him. From his portrait hanging over the gates of the Forbidden City, Mao Zedong gazes stoically into the miasma. Zuckerberg has in recent months made a point to showcase his affinity for the world’s only communist superpower, where Facebook — and Twitter, and Google, and the websites of many Western news outlets — are blocked under draconian web censorship laws. But a seemingly unperturbed Zuckerberg was apparently able to get around them in order to make his post. The photo went up on Friday morning local time, and within hours, its comments section was flooded with wry observations. Many, including one made by the Hong Kong student activist Joshua Wong, noted the irony of his effusive praise for a country that bans the product he sells. Some were distressed by Zuckerberg’s choice of venue: Tiananmen Square is where, in June 1989, the Chinese government massacred an inestimable number of student protesters who had gathered there to demand democratic reforms. Others were simply concerned for his physical well-being. Beijing vies with New Delhi for the dubious honor of being the world’s most polluted capital. The current bout of smog is the most severe of 2016 so far. At 9 a.m. on Friday — about an hour and a half before Zuckerberg shared the photo of his run — the U.S. embassy in Beijing measured the AQI at 305, which qualifies as “hazardous.” “Everyone should avoid all physical activity outdoors,” the embassy warns, enumerating the attendant risks: “Serious aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly; serious risk of respiratory effects in general population.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.05496696286169969, "subjectivity_score": 0.4716108452950558},

Spoon breakfast rice porridge with one hand; with the other, use the phone to order a new air purifier on Taobao, just another purchase in the $2 trillion Chinese e-commerce market. At work, use Baidu’s search engine and check the inbox on email provider 163.com. While slurping a bowl of noodles for lunch, peruse the latest musings of actor Yao Chen, who has over 78 million followers on Weibo. (That’s almost 8 million more than Katy Perry, Twitter’s most popular celebrity.) Choose a restaurant to meet friends for dinner, using Dianping’s recommendations. On the ride home, update a dating profile on Momo and zone out with Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils, an online game based on a martial-arts epic. There are 649 million Chinese online, more than twice the number of people online in the U.S. But they live in a parallel universe that is utterly apart from the rest of the digital world. The tech totems of our era–Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Wikipedia–are forbidden in China, casualties of the ruling Communist Party’s opposition to free expression. A vast system of online censorship, commonly known as the Great Firewall, blocks the populace from viewing material deemed dangerous to the state. Since the advent of the Arab Spring, which underscored for Chinese officials the political power of the Internet, mainland censors have stepped up their work, erasing threats to the party–real and imagined. Cordoned off by the Great Firewall and largely inhabited by indigenous tech outfits, the Chinese online ecosystem is evolving into the Galápagos of the Internet. But unlike a scattering of rocks in the Pacific Ocean, China is crammed with 1.3 billion people who propel the world’s second largest economy. Even as Beijing detaches its citizens from the global Net, the nation’s native tech firms are thriving. Chinese connect to the Internet through homegrown companies, some of which boast market caps greater than those of the foreign counterparts they are modeled after. Their digital experience matters, both to foreign companies still desperate for a piece of the China market–and contemplating bending their own rules to gain access–and to domestic firms profiting from their absence. “We’re basically living in the world of the Chinese Intranet,” says Jeremy Goldkorn, who runs an Internet and media research outfit focused on China. “The question is, How long can this last? Is this the new normal, or is China going to have to eventually integrate with the world?” China’s leader, XI Jinping, 61, has made no secret of his ambitions to restore his homeland to greatness. The digital sphere is just one more front in his quest to revitalize China and protect it from Western influence. Last year, after vowing to transform the nation into a “cyberpower,” Xi personally took over leadership of a new committee dedicated to the Internet’s management. Since then, China’s digital landscape has shifted rapidly, and Beijing’s influence has repeatedly reached U.S. shores, where Washington blames Beijing for cyberespionage offensives. Chinese netizens who once sounded off on corruption or pollution–always hot topics in China–have been silenced. Some have even been imprisoned. Rather than camouflage controversial thoughts with pseudonyms, Chinese are now required to unmask themselves on social media. With imprisonment threatened for “online rumormongering,” the use of Weibo’s Twitter-like microblogs to uncover scandal has waned. “What we’re seeing now is a large-scale offensive that’s comprehensive and well coordinated” says Yang Guobin, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of The Power of the Internet in China. At least 2 million Chinese toil as online censors, according to state media. Virtual private networks–foreign-operated servers long used to access sites blocked by the Chinese government–have come under open attack. Last year, Gmail was totally blocked for the first time ever. Then Microsoft’s Outlook email service in China was hacked. Communications to and from China, always slightly unreliable, turned erratic. Far from denying responsibility for such outages, Lu Wei, China’s Internet czar who runs the Cyberspace Affairs Administration, which was formed during Xi’s tenure, defended the changes. “The Internet is like a car,” said Lu, who once served as a top propaganda official in Beijing. “If it has no brakes, it doesn’t matter how fast the car is capable of traveling. Once it gets on the highway you can imagine what the end result will be.” For many chinese, though, the Internet behind the Great Firewall works just fine, delivering goods, services and cat videos with a swipe of a smartphone. If a user sticks to Chinese sites, the speed can be plenty fast and the price for access cheaper than in the U.S. China’s IT and communications market will be worth $465 billion this year, according to market-intelligence firm IDC–40% of total global growth. By 2018, Morgan Stanley estimates, more online transactions will occur in China than in the rest of the world combined. They may not yet be household names, but in September, e-commerce king Alibaba scored the largest IPO in Wall Street history. The company’s online marketplace, Taobao, serviced by the Alipay payment system, outsells Amazon and eBay combined. Tencent, Alibaba’s rival and designer of games and messaging service WeChat, reached a market cap of $185 billion, more than IBM’s. After its latest round of funding in December, Xiaomi was valued at some $45 billion, making it the world’s most valuable tech startup. The realities of China’s market pose a dilemma for foreign tech firms: Companies whose reputations depend on privacy rights and the free flow of information don’t appreciate restrictions imposed by any government. Yet what publicly traded company would do right by shareholders by ignoring the largest tech consumer market on earth? Already tech companies have tweaked offerings to accommodate various national laws, and that can have global implications. “Anytime a company invests resources in building the capacity to censor content, then it can be applied in other places,” says Ryan Budish, a fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society. It makes other governments wonder, Budish says, “oh, well, why couldn’t they do it for us?” Facebook, blocked in China in 2009 after riots in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, hasn’t given up. The company makes do selling ad space to Chinese companies wanting to market themselves abroad. “Our current business focus is to study and learn about China,” says a Facebook spokesman. Mark Zuckerberg is doing just that, in notably public fashion. In December, Zuckerberg hosted Internet regulator Lu at his office. The founder of a social network that has connected 1.35 billion active users worldwide–roughly the same number as China’s entire population–posed for smiling photos with the man who has overseen Beijing’s renewed assault on Internet freedom. Just to make the message extra clear, a copy of President Xi’s collected speeches–hardly scintillating reading–happened to be sitting on Zuckerberg’s desk when Lu visited. Will the charm campaign pay off? “If you think of the Chinese government’s litmus test for accepting foreign tech firms, Facebook is pretty socially corrosive,” says Duncan Clark, founder of BDA China, a tech consultancy in Beijing. “I don’t really see how Facebook can square the circle.” In the infancy of the Internet, optimists imagined that free information would flood across national boundaries, perhaps even catalyzing democratic reform in societies under authoritarian rule. China has proved both notions wrong. The Communist Party is firmly in control, just as it was in the earliest days of the web. “Do Chinese like being cut off from Facebook?” asks Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese media at the University of Oxford. “Absolutely not. But does that mean they’re seeking liberation from the Chinese state? I have my doubts.” But Charlie Smith, a co-founder of GreatFire.org, which monitors and circumvents Chinese filters, sees it another way. (His name is a pseudonym used to protect the sensitive work he does.) “Saying that Chinese don’t really care about whether or not they can access information,” Smith says, “is like saying that they are second-class information citizens and they don’t deserve it anyway.” It’s also true that the inconveniences of Xi’s Internet crackdown aren’t limited to dissident types. Google fonts, Twitter embeds and Facebook links are widespread across the Internet, meaning that even if web pages aren’t censored in China, they tend to load much more slowly because of these foreign trimmings. Gmail blockages have affected everyone from factory owners filling overseas orders and students applying to U.S. colleges to scientists trying to access international research. Nor is China’s Internet strategy simply a domestic one. U.S. officials have accused Chinese state-backed hackers of stealing American online records. On June 4, it was revealed that hackers accessed the personal data of at least 4 million current and former U.S. government employees–an attack that U.S. investigators said appeared to originate in China. (A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman called the accusations “irresponsible” and said China is also a victim of hacking.) Beyond allegations of cyberespionage, there are other ways in which China appears determined to extend online barricades beyond its national boundaries. In April, a report from the influential Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto described an offensive cyberblast dubbed “the Great Cannon,” which redirects traffic from Chinese sites like search engine Baidu to foreign websites like GreatFire.org that have helped Chinese circumvent their government. The Great Cannon is designed to crash those foreign websites by overloading them with traffic. China’s defenders say proposed rules to enhance state authority over the Internet are like antiterrorism laws and are no different from those that allow the U.S. government to spy on its citizens. U.S. officials are pushing for even more potential access to the encrypted data American tech firms collect. Beijing contends that China is simply strengthening cybersecurity in the post–Edward Snowden era. “I can choose who will be a guest in my home,” Internet czar Lu said last year. President xi has made it clear that he wants to build an “innovation society,” with strong Chinese tech firms that can compete internationally. Some of those companies have already made inroads abroad. Telecom giant Huawei was stymied in its efforts to sell networking equipment in the U.S. after a congressional report labeled the company a national-security threat. But more than 65% of Huawei’s revenue comes from overseas, with the company succeeding not just in the developing world but in Europe as well. The firm, founded by a former People’s Liberation Army officer, is rolling out smartphones and wearable technology in the U.S. Xiaomi aims to flood developing-world countries with affordable alternatives to Samsung and Apple devices. The smartphonemaker has begun selling power banks, headphones and fitness bands in U.S. and European online stores. Tencent claims that more than 100 million people outside China, many of whom are ethnic Chinese, use its WeChat messaging service despite concerns that its chats are subject to Chinese filters. Still, even Wen Ku, the top telecom official at China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, admitted this year that many Chinese Internet firms have thrived because of “a good policy environment”–one in which they did not have to contend with foreign challengers. It’s telling that while Baidu may control 80% of the domestic search-engine market, two of its engineers say privately that given a choice, they would use Google instead of their employer’s censored service. (Baidu, for example, excludes most references to the June 4, 1989, massacre from search results for Tiananmen Square.) “If you simply block the competitors, this is not the right way for China to be innovative,” says Cassandra Wang, who studies Chinese IT innovation at Zhejiang University in eastern China. China could be doing so much more online. A want ad for a job as an assistant monitor (as censors are known) for Sina, the portal that runs the biggest Weibo service, sets high standards: a bachelor’s degree, strong English skills, at least one year’s experience in online monitoring and an “enthusiastic and passionate” personality. What if an army of eager college graduates were used for more creative pursuits? “Imagine the innovation that could be coming out of China,” says GreatFire.org’s Smith. “That’s what the Internet could do.” For China, and the world. –With reporting by GU YONGQIANG/BEIJING, VICTOR LUCKERSON/NEW YORK CITY and SAM FRIZELL/WASHINGTON Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.09744192108066457, "subjectivity_score": 0.3525651617143764},

Amazon Fire TV costs another $40 if you’re eyeing the optional game controller, a necessary purchase if you want access to Fire TV’s library of first- and third-party games. Roku sells less powerful boxes for $80 and $50, too. Unlike Roku or Apple TV, Amazon’s interface has Amazon Prime DNA pretty much embedded throughout, and that’s an annual service that costs another $99 (bringing your total all the way up to $240, plus the recurring subscription fee, if you opt for the Fire TV gamepad). You can buy a Fire TV and use it for Netflix or Hulu, of course, but everything else about the Fire TV, from voice search to interface layout, is organized to push Amazon’s services. If you’re not planning to subscribe to Prime, the reasons to invest in Fire TV (and not a much more broad-minded Roku 3, app-wise) shrink dramatically. On the other hand, if Prime gets the job done for you, $99 a year for free two-day shipping, Kindle library lending and unlimited streaming of a sizable selection of video content may be a better deal than paying $96 a year ($8 a month) for either Netflix or Hulu Plus. The Apple TV tends to be an interface dog, lagging behind your commands and sometimes pausing for several seconds in processing limbo-land. The Roku 3 is significantly zippier, but still occasionally has to play catch up when you’re trying to move quickly between apps or a crowded menu. Not so Amazon’s Fire TV, which responds effortlessly and immediately to virtually any command, letting you speed through menus and dialogue boxes as fast as you’re able to input commands. Here’s a five-minute walkthrough of the Fire TV interface and a few of its features: I’m sure Apple and Roku have faster boxes in the oven, but for the moment, Fire TV is the king of set-top interface responsiveness and speed. Apple TV has a little over 30 channels (not counting Apple’s own), and Fire TV has fewer still at this point. Roku, by comparison, has a smorgasbord, making it the obvious pick if channel versatility is paramount. And since Roku doesn’t have a particular service dog in the hunt, you can probably expect it to remain the most channel-agnostic (and well-rounded, support-wise) of the bunch going forward. Amazon’s interface to its content is slicker, especially with voice search, granted, but where Roku’s version of Amazon Instant Video includes a discrete Prime-only content view, Amazon folds its Prime content into the interface in a way that makes browsing only Prime videos much less straightforward (and makes it much easier to stumble into for-pay content, which is clearly what Amazon wants to happen). Apple’s aluminum remote sports the best in Jobs-ian minimalism: unbelievably slender (almost too slender, in fact, if you have large hands), with all the navigational functionality smartly encapsulated by its wheel and center button and self-explanatory “Menu” and “Play/Pause” ones. Roku’s remote, by comparison, feels chunky and confusing (What does an “asterisk” button do again? What’s the difference between a backwards arrow and a backwards circle arrow?), and it’s easily the heaviest, though it has a few nice extras, notably the headphone jack for private wireless listening and the option to tilt it sideways like a Wii Remote with d-pad and A/B face buttons. The Fire TV’s relatively slim, matte-black remote makes its own design case fairly well, though it also employs less common button symbols (like its three-dash options one). It feels the best in my somewhat larger hands, and sports a microphone button at top, just below the microphone hole. I’ve thrown everything I could at the Fire TV’s remote in hopes of stumping it, from movies to TV shows and actors to directors to genres. Exceptions made for instances I clearly mispronounced something, the closest I got was “Peg-plus-cat,” which returned “Peg plus cat,” as desired, but also nonsense entries for “Pague Pluskat” and “Pigplus Kat.” Just to be a wise guy, I tried the one word almost no one can spell (but almost anyone can sing) from Disney’s Mary Poppins: Fire TV not only knew what I meant, but spelled it correctly. Voice search seems to rank results identical to manual searches on Amazon’s website (in the Instant Video category), which sometimes make sense and sometimes don’t. When you search “Ricardo Montalban,” for instance, Amazon brings up the somewhat obscure film The Desperate Mission first, followed by the second season of Bonanza (Montalban starred in just one episode). You have to cycle over several entries to get to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which, Fantasy Island aside (it’s not on Amazon Instant Video), I suspect many would argue is his best-known role. The one hard-to-miss downside, also noticed by my colleague Harry McCracken, is that Fire TV’s voice search works best and most often to summon Amazon content, failing to bring up the same content in a rival service’s channel, even if the rival service offers it free. How does Amazon know what I want to watch? How much stuff could it possible be presciently caching? So far, pretty much everything. Amazon calls this ASAP (Advanced Streaming and Prediction, obviously a play on “as soon as possible”) video buffering, and its job is to eliminate the wait you’re accustomed to experiencing when a streaming video buffers, as it will if you play anything on an Apple TV or Roku (or your computer or game console). Amazon claims the more you use the Fire TV, the better ASAP gets. I can’t confirm that because it has yet not to work. In fact, so far, it seems to be cataloging things that relate to nothing I’ve searched previously. I don’t know what sort of voodoo’s involved behind the scenes here, but it definitely seems to be working. Which would you rather play a first-person shooter with:   Fire TV is the only set-top that offers the latter. Not original-Xbox monstrous, but Amazon’s definitely erred on the side of large, clapping a sizable flat-lying faceplate on top of a battery-thickened body with enormous handlebars that’ll make you extra-grateful for the smarter design advances both Sony and Microsoft employed in their PlayStation 4 and Xbox One’s controllers, respectively. I’ll have a more detailed review of the Fire TV-as-games-microconsole soon, after I’ve spent more time with the games (especially Amazon Game Studios’ Sev Zero), but at this point, I’d say the gamepad reminds me most of the Xbox One’s controller, only bulkier. Not by much at this point — Roku has a decent number, too. But Amazon is the first of these three to offer first-party games, developed by its own Amazon Game Studios, which probably signifies the company committing to this space long-term. Amazon’s also promising “thousands more [games] coming soon,” meaning, I assume, that it intends to eventually crack open the entire Android games library. When I plugged my Fire TV in, it automatically figured out who I was and signed me in — no fuss, no muss. That’s a little creepy, but also kind of cool. I have long, random, easily forgettable passwords unique to each of my accounts, which means I’m often summoning a password management app on my computer or smartphone to sign into things. With Fire TV, Amazon removes that step by taking care of business beforehand. There’s just one potential problem: This past year, Amazon mis-delivered several items I’d ordered, presumably sending them to someone else or simply losing them. If someone intercepts your Fire TV, unlikely as that sounds, then opts to misbehave, they’d have temporary access to your account simply by plugging the device in. That’s probably a security risk Amazon’s going to have to address at some point. Remote control apps aside, Roku only works with “select” Android devices (see here). Apple TV, as you may know, can partner with iOS products, allowing you to AirPlay-stream videos, pictures and even select games through your television set. Fire TV includes an AirPlay-like feature that lets you mirror movies, TV shows, music and photos from your Kindle Fire tablet to your TV as well as control the display remotely, but it also lets you turn your TV into a “second screen” by clicking what Amazon calls a “fling” icon to fire audio or video running on the tablet at your TV (and freeing up the tablet for other tasks). There’s also a Wii U-like contextual view feature, content-depending, that lets you view additional info, pulled from IMDb, about whatever TV show or movie you’re watching. All three boxes are roughly the size of hockey pucks, and when you’re the size of a hockey puck that can fit pretty much anywhere, aesthetics cease to matter. I couldn’t care less whether one has beveled edges or another’s the height of a dime (faced up). Here’s what all three have in common in my household: they go on my entertainment center’s top shelf and I never look at them again. Amazon does its best to play down its competitors’ sonic capabilities on its comparison site, but while Fire TV supports Dolby Digital Plus surround (and includes an optical audio out option), both Apple TV and Roku 3 support Dolby Digital 5.1 surround (that is, 5-channels plus a subwoofer). The difference? Dolby Digital Plus supports higher bit rates for improved audio quality and has better techniques for reducing compression artifacts, though it still involves compression. (No one’s doing lossless streaming at this point, or what’s called Dolby TrueHD, for which you’ll have to turn to high-end Blu-ray playback hardware like the PlayStation 4.) In practice, we’re talking subtle differences most won’t notice (and certainly not in scenarios where you’re playing sound through your TV’s speakers, as I do). And if you’re an audiophile with a stacked, component-filled living room, chances are you’re going to be more interested in a much higher-end streaming video-capable box like Sony’s PlayStation 4 anyway. Amazon says Fire TV is “made for music,” but apparently not Amazon-bought music out of the gate, which is strange indeed. If you’re an Amazon Cloud Player user, or you’ve simply purchased music through Amazon, you can’t access it directly through Fire TV right now (there’s not even a music option in the menu — the only music features are third-party ones like Pandora, TuneIn and iHeart Radio). The company says integration with Amazon Cloud Player will be here in May, however. For Roku owners, there’s a dedicated Roku app — dubbed “Amazon Cloud Player” and made by Amazon — precisely for that. If you already own a Roku 3 or Apple TV and don’t play games and don’t care about Amazon Prime, there’s not much that argues for the purchase of Amazon’s Fire TV at this point (if you already own the vastly content-superior Roku 3, in particular, which includes Amazon services Fire TV doesn’t, I’d steer clear of Fire TV for now). If you own none of the three boxes above, this gets trickier, because it depends to an extent on what sort of ancillary devices and services you own or use. If you’re an iOS user and/or invested in iTunes, there’s a strong argument for the Apple TV because nothing else supports iTunes or AirPlay. Likewise, if you’re a Kindle Fire user and find the second-screen angle appealing, there’s a very strong argument for Fire TV. And if you don’t really care about device-partnering and you prefer to hop around services (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) in more of an egalitarian environment, interface-wise, the Roku 3 should be at the top of your buy list. But if you do use Amazon Prime, you’ve already invested in a Kindle Fire, you want to dabble in Android gaming on your TV screen with a proper gamepad, and you care about interface responsiveness and voice accessibility, Fire TV becomes easy to recommend. It has no obvious bugs or performance issues or gotchas (beyond the ones mentioned above) at this point. Short of missing services like Amazon Music — albeit temporarily — it already feels like a second- or third-gen product, reasonably priced, content-rich and refined.

In the short time I’ve had with it so far, I’ve only dipped briefly into the games, which are one of this Android-based gadget’s major features. And I haven’t yet tried the integration that lets you throw video from a Kindle Fire tablet to the Fire TV. With that disclaimer out of the way, some initial impressions and notes: 1. It doesn’t blow away the competition. The Fire may be a latecomer, but it’s not a me-too knockoff: It has the beefiest specs of any product in its category and by far the most ambitious approach to gaming. But if you’ve already got a Roku or Apple TV, you don’t need a Fire TV. And if you haven’t bought one yet, all three contenders are worth considering. 2. It’s a bit thin on content. Not that there isn’t a lot to watch. And if you’re mainly interested in Amazon’s own stuff–including rentals, videos to purchase, and the items available at no extra cost to Amazon Prime members–you’ll probably be very happy. But Roku and Apple TV, which have been around for years, both have more in the way of sports (Fire TV just has Watch ESPN, MLB.tv and NBA Game Time) as well as HBO Go and other significant offerings not yet available on the Fire. Actually, Roku has over a thousand channels of content–a figure I can’t see either Amazon or Apple approaching any time soon. 3. The voice part of voice search works just about perfectly. At least for me. When I pressed and held the voice button on the little remote control, its built-in microphone understood almost everything I said–“Albert Brooks,” “Lady Gaga,” “The Freshman,” “Sonic,” “Pandora,” “comedies,” “new releases” and much more. Slick indeed. 4. The search part has some quirks. In the majority of cases, it does more or less what you’d expect: Search for “John Wayne,” and you’ll get John Wayne movies as far as the eye can see. But in multiple cases, I found the results to be anywhere from slightly weird to very weird. For instance:   5. It is really, really easy to rent or buy content from Amazon with this thing. The voice search, generally snappy interface and 1-Click-style integration with your Amazon account add up to the fastest way I’ve seen to find something you want to see, pay for it and begin watching. It’s the best implementation of Amazon’s streaming service yet, which helps explain why Amazon decided it was worth building its own box even though it’s already on so many other companies’ devices. 6. Video sources other than Amazon are mostly second-class citizens. I noticed that voice search sometimes pulled up music videos from Vevo. But even though the Fire TV offers two major competitors to Amazon’s own video service, Netflix and Hulu Plus, they’re self-contained apps rather than part of the primary, Amazon-centric interface, and they don’t work with voice search. Use voice (or the main text-based search) to look for “House of Cards,” for instance, and you’ll only get the show’s first season, which is available for purchase from Amazon–even if you subscribe to Netflix, where you can watch the first two seasons at no additional cost. 7. The ASAP video feature really works. Amazon says that the box attempts to guess what you might want to watch before you’ve asked for it, so it can pre-fetch it and play it back instantly. And indeed, some videos started the moment I selected them, in a way that feels borderline impossible. Others took a few seconds, but were still speedy compared to the norm for Netflix and Hulu. 8. The box seems to err on the side of smooth video quality over a crisp picture. When I connected to my home network over Wi-Fi, I noticed that the image was often a bit blocky, but that the stream almost never stalled. (I ended up plugging the Fire into a wired network connection, which got rid of the blockiness.) 9. I don’t care much about the relative industrial designs of these little TV boxes. Amazon brags about Fire TV being .7″ thick, the same height as a dime balanced on its edge. But really, the nice thing about this device, Apple TV and Roku is that they’re all about the size of a sandwich, and easy to tuck out of the way. The aesthetics and exact sizes don’t matter all that much, because all of these boxes blend so unobtrusively into the background. 10. Amazon’s own music service is missing. I’ve bought a fair number of albums from the company, but I can’t listen to them on Fire TV. Which is a tad odd, since it does have Pandora, iHeartRadio and TuneIn. When Amazon introduces something new, it often does so at a price that changes the game. That hasn’t happened here. Instead, it tried to put together a really nice product at a price point ($99) with plenty of precedent. A couple of days ago, there were only two viable competitors in the market for small, simple, affordable TV boxes: Roku and Apple. Now there are three–and it’ll be fun to see where Amazon, which takes categories seriously when it gets into them, goes from here.

On the contrary, a merger between the two largest cable companies in the country will be great for consumers, Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen said in an interview with C-SPAN. Cohen made his comments as opposition to the deal continues to grow from public interest groups, lawmakers, and industry observers. Critics of the deal say the merger would concentrate too much market power in the hands of a single media and entertainment behemoth, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. Comcast dismisses such fears and insists that the merger will result in better service for consumers. The Justice Department is examining the proposed deal to make sure it doesn’t violate antitrust law, along with more than two dozen state attorneys general who have joined a multi-state group reviewing the transaction. The merger also faces scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, which is charged with ensuring that the deal serves the public interest. “This transaction is all about increasing competition and creating more consumer benefit as a result of gaining additional scale,” Cohen told C-SPAN. Comcast says that the deal isn’t anticompetitive because the two companies don’t compete for consumers in the same markets. Over the last few decades, the nation’s largest cable TV companies have divided up the U.S. by region so that the major players now dominate their respective areas. Comcast rules in Philadelphia, Chicago and Boston. Time Warner Cable dominates in New York City, Dallas and Los Angeles. Cohen says that the combined company would control no more that 30% of the national pay-TV market. (Time Warner Cable was spun off from TIME parent Time Warner in 2009.) Cable TV represents a shrinking part of the industry. Last year, cable providers lost nearly 2 million video subscriptions, the first full-year decline on record, according to a recent study by research group SNL Kagan. It’s the latest sign that consumers are increasingly “cutting the cord” and gravitating toward Internet-based entertainment options like Netflix and Hulu. (MORE: Netflix vs. Comcast ‘Net Neutrality’ Spat Erupts After Traffic Deal) As the Internet has become a crucial tool for commerce, communications and entertainment, companies like Comcast and Time Warner Cable are increasingly becoming broadband companies. The old distinctions between cable TV, Internet, and phone service are starting to collapse. Millions of Americans now subscribe to bundled packages that combine all three services through a single pipe coming into their homes. If Comcast buys Time Warner Cable, the company would have nearly 40% of the high-speed wireline broadband Internet market in the U.S., according to industry estimates. Critics of the deal say that would give Comcast an alarming amount of power over the 21st century’s signature communications medium. Cohen acknowledges that the deal’s implications for the broadband market are “appropriate to think about and discuss,” but argues that it’s “not a very scary story,” due to increasing competition from wireless broadband. “I think it’s indisputable today that wireless is certainly beginning to be an effective competitor and substitute for at least many uses of broadband,” Cohen said. (Harvard Law School professor Susan Crawford, a fierce critic of the deal, disputes that assertion. Wireless broadband service “will not substitute” for high-speed wired access, she told TIME last year.) Comcast argues that bigger is better. “Sometimes big is a bad thing,” said Cohen. “I acknowledge that. But sometimes big is really important, really necessary and really good. And that would tend to be in high capital expenditure industries, in industries where innovation is fast moving and where you need a lot of investment in R&D and innovation to keep pace. And that is our industry.” He added: “The rationale for this transaction is all about scale. We are going to get bigger.” (MORE: Susan Crawford. Is Broadband Internet Access a Public Utility?) Cohen dismissed opponents of the proposed merger as “the same group of people” who have opposed media and telecom consolidation over the last two decades. Their “sky is going to fall” predictions have been “discredited and disproven,” Cohen said. “I have been struck by the absence of rational, knowledgeable voices in this space coming out in opposition or even raising serious questions about the transaction,” Cohen added. Last month, editors at The Economist magazine wrote a sharply-worded editorial against the deal, urging U.S. officials to “reject a merger that would reduce competition, provide no benefit to consumers and sap the incentive to innovate.” A former FCC commissioner has called the deal “an affront to the public interest.” The New York Times editorial board raised substantive concerns about the deal, as did columnists at The New Yorker and The Washington Post. Harvard Law professor Susan Crawford, perhaps the deal’s most persuasive critic, argues that broadband Internet access should be viewed as a public utility.

The merger, which would combine the two largest cable companies in the country, would harm competition while offering no “tangible benefits” to consumers, according to the groups, which urged regulators to block the deal because it would give Comcast too much market power. The letter, which was signed by Public Knowledge, Free Press, Consumers Union, the New America Foundation and other prominent consumer advocacy groups was sent to Attorney General Eric Holder and Federal Communications Chairman Tom Wheeler 24 hours before a senior Comcast executive is set to testify about the deal before Congress Wednesday. The Justice Department, along with more than two dozen state attorneys general, is examining the proposed merger to ensure it doesn’t violate antitrust law. The FCC, meanwhile, is charged with ensuring that the deal serves the public interest. Critics say the merger would concentrate too much market power in the hands of a single corporate giant, potentially harming competitors and the broader public interest. “The Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would give Comcast unthinkable gatekeeper power over our commercial, social and civic lives,” the groups wrote. “Everyone from the biggest business to the smallest startup, from elected officials to everyday people, would have to cross through Comcast’s gates. Given these clear and present dangers and the complete lack of any tangible benefits, it’s clear that the union of the nation’s No. 1 and No. 2 cable companies is not good for competition or in the public interest.” Comcast says that the deal isn’t anticompetitive because it doesn’t currently compete with Time Warner Cable for customers in any of the same geographic markets. (Over the last few decades, the nation’s largest cable TV companies have divided up the U.S. by city and region so that the major players now dominate their respective areas. For example, Comcast controls Philadelphia, Chicago and Boston, while Time Warner Cable is dominant in New York City, Dallas and Los Angeles. Time Warner Cable was spun off from TIME parent company Time Warner in 2009). However, critics of the deal warn that the merger could give Comcast unprecedented “monopsony” power — which is one buyer with many sellers, as opposed to “monopoly” power, which is one seller with many buyers — in the market for programming. Such monopsony power could mean downward pressure on prices for consumers, but only if Comcast chose to pass those savings on to them. That seems unlikely. “We’re certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly,” Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen told reporters when the deal was announced. Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, wrote in a report about the deal released Tuesday that Comcast could use its new monopsony power to “increase its profits by paying less for the goods and services it buys and charge more or gain market share for its own products by using its buyer power.” Such market power could ultimately harm consumers, according to Gene Kimmelman, president and CEO of Public Knowledge, because it would enable Comcast to “demand less than market prices for programming. Programmers will seek to make up lost revenues by increasing prices to other distributors, harming the ability of smaller distributors to compete and raising prices to consumers.” (MORE: Comcast Set For Grilling Over Time Warner Cable Deal) Even still, Cooper says the fact that Comcast and Time Warner Cable don’t currently compete for cable customers illustrates the lack of competition that already exists in the market — even before the proposed merger. “Far from excusing the merger from antitrust and Communications Act scrutiny,” Cooper wrote, “the fact that Comcast and Time Warner do not compete head-to-head merely reminds us of the sad state of horizontal competition in the video distribution markets that they dominate in their local areas — broadband Internet access and multichannel video.” The lack of competition created by decades of industry consolidation has created a situation where the dominant companies have little incentive to improve broadband speeds and service. The World Economic Forum recently ranked the United States 35th out of 148 countries in Internet bandwidth. In the U.S., Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest cable providers, ranked 15th and 16th, respectively, in customer satisfaction among 17 television service providers, according to a recent study by Consumer Reports. Meanwhile, the cost of cable subscriptions has significantly outpaced inflation, Consumer Reports found. “Both Comcast and Time Warner Cable rank very poorly with consumers when it comes to value for the money and have earned low ratings for customer support,” says Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel at Consumers Union. “A merger combining these two huge companies would give Comcast even greater control over the cable and broadband Internet markets, leading to higher prices, fewer choices, and worse customer service for consumers.” She added: “The FCC and Department of Justice should stand with consumers and oppose this merger.” Federal policymakers at the Justice Department and the FCC are now confronted with a difficult decision: Should the two largest cable companies in the country be allowed to merge, creating a media and communications giant of unprecedented scope and scale? In a context where the U.S. lags behind other industrialized countries in broadband speeds, does the merger benefit consumers? Last year, the Obama administration declared that “the delivery of fast, affordable and reliable broadband service to all corners of the United States must be a national imperative.” Regulators must now decide if Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable advances that agenda.

Though they don’t hit shelves until Sept. 24, we got our hands on some and conducted a little taste test. They feature Oreo’s “golden” vanilla cookies with a layer of pumpkin spice creme in between. The pumpkin flavor, however, is pretty subtle — you definitely get more of the “spice” aspect, namely cinnamon and a little nutmeg. The whole thing, of course, is very sweet. Among TIME staffers, responses were largely positive. “It tastes like fall!” one staffer exclaimed in delight. “It tastes like a Yankee candle!” Another agreed that the cookies were “amazing”and another, initially a bit skeptical, said, “I’ve had far worse.” One reporter said they tasted just like pumpkin pie, and another said they reminded her of chai lattes. If you want to find out for yourself, they’ll be available at retailers nationwide beginning Sept. 24 for 6-8 weeks, or until supplies last. Most of us agreed that these were good, but not transcendent — and probably not good enough to become as much of a cultural sensation as the iconic Starbucks drink. As one reporter said, “I prefer this in latte form.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3144645/taylor-swift-shake-it-off-22-pumpkin-spice-latte/"], "sentiment_score": 0.13139267676767677, "subjectivity_score": 0.5252373737373737},

Zuckerberg, who was visiting Tsinghua University after being appointed to its board, said he began studying Chinese in 2010 because his wife, Priscilla Chan, comes from a Chinese background. When he was planning to propose, he even asked his Chan’s mother in Chinese for her daughter’s hand in marriage. Some are speculating that Zuckerberg’s Chinese—clunky and off-tone, but nonetheless capable—is also a way to win over the Chinese government, which has blocked Facebook among other American social media networks. Here are some of the famous people who have surprised us through their dexterity with a language so challenging for English-speakers to learn, the U.S. Defense Language Institute ranks it as most difficult (alongside Japanese, Korean and Arabic). Vanessa Branch The British actor shocked audiences when she began speaking fluent Chinese during an episode of Entourage and in the film Suburban Girl. Branch also starred in a Chinese feature film called Milk and Fashion. The film’s director told the Shanghai Daily that she was “the first non-Asian Hollywood actress to star in a Chinese-speaking lead role.” Branch learned the language while studying at Middlebury College, where she double majored in theater and Chinese, she told Arude Magazine in an interview. Kevin Rudd Australia’s former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd majored in Chinese at the Australian National University of Canberra, and then continued his studies in Taiwan. He has delivered speeches in fluent Chinese and also conducted Q&As in Chinese. The humble politician once told an interviewer that his “Mandarin is really bad, and it’s getting worse and worse.” And yet he still managed to conduct the entire interview fluently with excellent pronunciation. Mark Rowswell (Dashan) The Canadian performer known by his Chinese stage name, Dashan, isn’t that well known in the West. But he’s a household name in China known for his acting, comedy and hosting gigs done in his native speaker level Mandarin. Rowswell learned Chinese as a student at the University of Toronto before moving to Beijing to study at Peking University. He rose to stardom after performing a skit in Chinese on CCTV’s 1988 New Year’s Gala, a Chinese television broadcast viewed by nearly half a billion people. Herbert Hoover and Lou Henry Hoover Hoover is the only U.S. president to be proficient in Chinese, which he learned after he moved to China with his wife, Lou Henry Hoover, after they graduated from Stanford, according to the Hoover Association. They lived there for nearly two years while Hoover worked as a mining engineer. The future First Lady was more fluent than her husband, and when they moved into the White House, they occasionally conversed in Chinese if they didn’t want others to hear them. Mira Sorvino Golden Globe winner Mira Sorvino hasn’t spoken Chinese on camera, but the Mighty Aphrodite Oscar-winner studied the language at Harvard, where she majored in East Asian Studies. In August, Sorvino said on her Reddit AMA in response to whether she was still fluent in Chinese that “It’s mamahuhuda. Which means ‘so so’ or ‘half-horse, half-tiger.'” Lou Jing The half-black, half-Chinese singer sparked a nationwide discourse on racism in China after competing on Go! Oriental Girl, a Chinese reality TV singing competition. Jing, who was born and raised in China, spoke and sang in perfect Chinese, flooring people who assumed she wasn’t actually from China. Dubbed the “Chocolate Girl,” she took the stage after being eliminated to tell audiences not to judge her by her skin color: “I think I’m the same as all the girls here, except for my skin color,” she said. “We share the same stage, and the same dream.” Read next: It’s a Long Way to the Top (if You Wanna Be a Uighur Pop Star) Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3532634/mark-zuckerberg-chinese-facebook/", "http://time.com/3424671/ablajan-awut-ayup-uighur-xinjiang-music-pop-star-china/?xid=time_readnext"], "sentiment_score": 0.07576855511638121, "subjectivity_score": 0.27675669740887127},

The Associated Press cited a report in Chinese state-linked media saying that publishing house Mighty Current Media’s co-founder, Gui Minhai, had admitted to illegally selling more than 4,000 books that were not approved by Chinese authorities. Gui — a Swedish passport holder — disappeared from his home in Thailand in October and has already given one televised confession for a different crime, in which he appeared visibly distressed. Three other men, Lui Por, Cheung Chi-ping and Lam Wing-kee — who are shareholders and employees of Mighty Current Media and the connected Causeway Bay Books shop — were detained during trips to China. Many believe the detentions are related to Mighty Current’s publication of salacious books about the private lives of top Chinese Communist Party officials. The four men appeared in a broadcast on Mandarin-language station Phoenix Television confirming their involvement in the selling of “unauthorized” books in China, according to Reuters. It is unclear how Phoenix — which is privately owned in Hong Kong but seen as closely aligned with Beijing — gained access to the detained men. A fifth Hong Kong bookseller, Lee Bo — who holds British citizenship — was not featured in the Phoenix report. Lee went missing in the territory in January before tuning up in the custody of Chinese authorities, sparking fears that he was kidnapped by mainland agents. The case has sparked widespread unease over what would be a breach of Hong Kong’s judicial autonomy amid growing fears of encroachment by Beijing.

The arrests include that of Zhou Shifeng, founder of Beijing’s Fengrui law firm that was the main target of a sweeping government crackdown last year, Agence France-Presse reported. According to a social-media post by his colleague Liu Xiaoyuan, Zhou has been charged with “state subversion,” which carries a possible life sentence. Zhou and more than 100 other lawyers, both from his firm and elsewhere, were detained in July in what many said was China’s toughest suppression of rights activists in several years. Chinese state media reported that Zhou had “confessed” to an unspecified crime a few days after his arrest, prompting fears that he was made to cooperate under duress. “For the crime to become as serious as state subversion, it’s a completely political charge,” Liu told Reuters. Others charged with subversion include a 24-year-old trainee lawyer, Li Shuyun, and Zhou’s colleague, Wang Quanzhang, with the latter’s sister confirming news of his arrest in an online post. Legal assistant Zhao Wei, also 24, has meanwhile been charged with “incitement to state subversion” — a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison — according to her husband and mother, who cited a police notice. Similar notices were posted on the Internet by friends of lawyers Xie Yanyi, Xie Yang and Sui Muqing, indicating they have also been charged with incitement. The notices show that Zhou, Zhao and Li are being held at a detention centre in the northern city of Tianjin.

Among them: How can I also make billions of dollars by selling my mobile app to Facebook? As someone who writes about technology for a living and who’s definitely not a billionaire, I can’t answer that for you. But I can help with some other things you might want to know: It’s a messaging app you can use in place of your wireless carrier’s regular texting service. You enter your phone number and WhatsApp looks through your contact list for other people who are using the app. Then you can message those users all you want without limits or overage charges. The app is available on many platforms and is free to download and has no ads, but it costs $1 per year after the first year. Right now, WhatsApp has more than 450 million active users — meaning they use the service at least once a month — compared to 1.23 billion for Facebook. Those users send 500 million pictures back and forth per day, about 150 million more than Facebook. A lot. My colleague Harry McCracken put together a chart of big startup acquisitions, and WhatsApp is the biggest. Most deals don’t come anywhere close. Bigger companies tend to change hands for a lot more money, however. For instance, Comcast wants to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion. That’s not the plan. Facebook says WhatsApp will act like an independent company and stay in its own Mountain View, Calif. headquarters. The product will stay ad-free, and the two companies will focus on growth for the next few years. Then, they’ll figure out how to make money in some way that doesn’t involve shoveling ads into the app. (Harvesting all that sweet, sweet user data for targeted ads on Facebook or Instagram would be the safe bet, but more on that shortly.) WhatApp says nothing will change. Perhaps the $1 per year charge will go away at some point, given that Facebook says it’s not a big priority to expand subscriptions. One potential downside: WhatsApp may become less inclined to work with companies that compete with Facebook, or vice versa. See, for reference, Instagram killing Twitter integration in 2012, several months after Twitter cut off its contact lists for Instagram users. We can only speculate that Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram — or Twitter’s previous failed acquisition — had something to do with the bad blood. This is the fun part, because every tech pundit thinks they’ve figured out the “real” reason for the acquisition, when in reality everyone’s just making educated guesses. If there is a “real” answer, it’s probably a combination of several theories, some of which are related. Here’s a sampling:    Oh, and Facebook’s official line is that it acquired WhatsApp to “make the world more open and connected,” which is probably as true as it is vague. Mark Zuckerberg always seems genuine in his world-changing ambitions, but there’s always the business side to keep in mind. The overarching themes here are about attention and user data. WhatsApp has proven it can capture the former, and while Facebook says it has very little of the latter from WhatsApp, that can change, and messaging can become a rich data source for Facebook’s core advertising business. Perhaps that sounds scary, but it’s not much different from how Gmail works now. How will we know when this starts happening? Just wait for the inevitable revision of privacy policies allowing WhatsApp and Facebook to freely share their data with one another.

The proposed merger of the two largest cable companies in the United States has attracted criticism from public interest groups who say that the deal would concentrate too much market power in the hands of one company. Along with the Justice Department, which will address antitrust concerns, the merger faces scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, which is charged with ensuring that the deal serves the public interest. Comcast maintains that the deal isn’t anticompetitive because the two companies don’t compete in the same markets, and says the merger will result in improved service for consumers. Some 25 states are currently participating in the multistate group reviewing the proposed transaction, according to a person familiar with the probe. Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen’s office is part of the group, a spokesperson for Jepsen confirmed to TIME. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s office is also participating. “We are part of a multistate group reviewing the proposed transaction along with the U.S. DOJ Antitrust Division,” a spokesperson for Bondi said in an emailed statement. California Attorney General Kamala Harris’s office is also part of the multistate review group, according to a person familiar with the matter. Harris’s office declined to comment. New York is not part of the multistate review group at this time, a spokesperson told TIME. A spokesperson for Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said he “cannot confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of an investigation.” Indiana officials are also examining the deal to determine “the potential impact in Indiana,” a spokesperson told Reuters, which first reported the states probes. Pennsylvania, where Comcast is headquartered, is “reviewing the case independently,” a spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office told Reuters. A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the federal antitrust probe, but declined to comment on the multistate review group. Combining Comcast and Time Warner Cable would create a corporate giant with approximately 33 million pay-TV customers and about one-third of the U.S. broadband Internet market. Comcast already owns NBCUniversal, after buying the media company from industrial conglomerate General Electric. As part of the proposed Time Warner Cable deal, Comcast will extend the commitment it made during the NBCUniversal review to abide by open-Internet principles until 2018. Major entertainment and content companies that sell programming to cable and satellite companies have expressed concern that the merger could create a powerful gatekeeper with unprecedented buying power in the market. This could give the combined company what economists call “monopsony” power, which is one buyer with many sellers, as opposed to “monopoly” power, which is one seller with many buyers. Such monopsony power could have benefits for consumers, because the combined company would have increased leverage in contentious negotiations with the TV broadcasters over “retransmission consent fees,” which cable and satellite companies pay for the right to carry popular programming like prime-time shows and sports. That could mean downward pressure on prices for consumers, but only if the combined company chose to pass those savings on to them, which is by no means certain. Retransmission consent fees were at the heart of last year’s dispute between CBS and Time Warner Cable, which led to an unprecedented, monthlong CBS blackout for more than 3 million Time Warner Cable subscribers in New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas. Time Warner Cable, which was spun off from TIME parent Time Warner in 2009, is an attractive takeover target because of its major presence in several important markets, including New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas, as well as large portions of Ohio, North Carolina and Maine. In order to help assuage regulators, Comcast has said it’s willing to jettison as many as 3 million subscribers in order to make sure the new company does not exceed 30% of the cable market. Comcast declined to comment on the state probes, but it’s worth noting that these state attorneys general reviews are typical for a proposed merger of this size, because the deal has the potential to affect millions of consumers across the country. During the review process for Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal, some 14 states participated.

Nearly one year after Apple first unveiled its 12-inch MacBook (no “Pro” or “Air” in the name), it’s introducing a new model with better performance, longer battery life, improved graphics, and a new rose gold color option. This refreshed MacBook includes the same Retina screen, Force Touch trackpad, redesigned keyboard, and single USB Type-C port as its predecessor. The result is a sleek, gorgeous machine with enough processing power for average users. But Apple still insists on giving the MacBook only a single USB port, and a Type-C one at that. While USB Type-C is a big improvement over past implementations (it’s faster and the cables work no matter which way you plug them in), there aren’t many compatible accessories just yet. I still want to be able to plug in accessories like hard drives and flash drives while simultaneously charging my laptop, too. That isn’t possible with the MacBook sans an adapter. That being said, I understand why Apple designed the MacBook this way. Users who store most of their data in the cloud and don’t frequently plug their laptop into external monitors tend to value portability over connectivity. And as frustrating as a new standard might be, USB Type-C will be a big improvement when its time comes. Giving the MacBook only a single port also allowed Apple to make it the company’s thinnest and sleekest laptop yet. The new MacBook is the same size and weight as last year’s model, weighing 2.03 pounds and measuring 0.14 inches thick at its slimmest point. The MacBook’s svelte design is undoubtedly its most striking feature. It’s so lean I almost forgot I was carrying a laptop in my bag. When I went to reach for it one time, I expected instead to pull out the 12-inch iPad Pro, which only weighs about half a pound less than the MacBook. The only visible physical difference between this year’s MacBook and last year’s model is the new rose gold color option, marking the first time such a color has been available on a Mac product.  The MacBook’s 2,304 x 1,440 resolution screen is nearly as dazzling as the notebook’s design. Having a sharp and colorful screen doesn’t set the MacBook apart from its competitors — most high-end laptops come with incredibly high-res screens — but it’s a noticeable jump for those used to the MacBook Air. Colors looked rich, and viewing angles were wide enough for instances when you’re showing a photos or videos to a group huddled around the screen. Other than its size and weight, those switching to the MacBook from a MacBook Air or Pro will notice another substantial change: the keyboard. Apple revamped the keyboard last year with a new butterfly mechanism that it says is 40% thinner than the scissor mechanism used on most traditional keyboards. The MacBook’s keys sit flush with the keyboard deck, rather than slightly protruding from it. I was skeptical of this, since I usually prefer keyboards with more depth and tactile feedback. But the MacBook’s keyboard felt surprisingly comfortable. I was actually able to type slightly faster with it than I usually do on my MacBook Air. I imagine this is because the MacBook’s keyboard, although shallow, doesn’t feel cheap like lower-quality keyboards on less expensive notebooks. The MacBook also comes with Apple’s new Force Touch trackpad, which allows you to access certain shortcuts by pressing down harder on the touch area. You can preview links in Safari before opening them, look up a word on a website without leaving the page, and add dates to your calendar with a gesture Apple calls Force Click. While this worked well overall, I didn’t find myself using it very often. Some may find it helpful, but I wouldn’t consider it to be a deciding factor when shopping for a notebook. With its latest-generation Intel processor and updated graphics, the new MacBook packs more than enough performance for the average user. Apple’s MacBook is powered by Intel’s new Core M processors, which are designed to enable super slim, fan-less laptops while providing long-lasting battery life. They’re not as powerful as Intel’s Core I processors, like those found in the MacBook Air and Pro models. But they’re plenty capable considering their compact size. I used the laptop for nearly an entire workday, and saw no issues when browsing the Web with multiple tabs and apps open. Apps also opened quickly with almost no noticeable lag. Apple says the new MacBook’s graphics performance should be about 25% faster than that of its previous model. It’s not powerful enough to run hefty games on high settings, but casual gaming is smooth. Even playing BioShock Infinite on its lowest graphics settings was doable, but gameplay was slow with the settings bumped up to medium or high. Still, Apple isn’t marketing this notebook to gamers. It’s really meant for the average person who uses their laptop to check email, go online, stream Netflix and look at photos. On all of those fronts, it performs just fine. The laptop’s battery lasted roughly seven and a half hours during my usage, which mostly included browsing the Web, playing casual games, and streaming video. This was almost enough to make it through an entire workday and is about on par with what some critics found when testing last year’s model. It’s important to keep in mind that battery life always varies depending on your own use, so actual results may differ. The MacBook is a beautiful computer that’s designed for those who want the most portable desktop experience possible with an Apple device. Its lack of ports can be limiting — for some, that may be impossible to overlook. And, as is usually the case with Apple, the MacBook isn’t exactly a bargain. Samsung’s ATIV Book 9 offers similar hardware with a sharper screen and more ports for $100 less. It’s also nearly as light as the MacBook, weighing 2.09 pounds versus Apple’s 2.03 pounds. Still, the MacBook’s design and portability won’t disappoint Apple fans, so long as you don’t mind going all-in on USB Type-C. 4 out of 5 Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.0959610924055369, "subjectivity_score": 0.49131965154187374},

An oasis town of some 30,000 people off the old Silk Road in China’s northwestern Xinjiang region, Sangzhu is home to ethnic Uighur farmers, mosques and a bazaar. Women move quietly through courtyards, pulling their kerchiefs tight against the wind from the Taklamakan Desert. Bearded men lead donkeys down the road. Then a bus rattles around the corner, shaking sleepy Sangzhu to life. From the backseats of the rusty clunker comes the kind of feral scream that can only be produced by wild packs of teenage girls. They pound the windows and wave their hands with celebrity-stricken abandon, jostling for a better view. “Ablajan!” they yell as they roll by. “Ab-laaa-jaaan!” Standing street-side in a studded leather jacket and shades, glancing down at his iPhone, is the object of their frenzy: Uighur pop star, and hometown hero, Ablajan Awut Ayup. He looks up at them, smiles a little sheepishly, and touches his hand to his heart. Then he turns to me and pops his collar with all the mock swagger he can muster. “The ladies,” he says in English, “they like my style.” Ablajan, 30, is one of the hottest singers in China’s vast northwest. His catchy songs fuse the rhythms of Central Asia with the stylings of global pop—a sort of Sufi poetry-meets-Justin-Bieber vibe. On stage, he channels the theatricality of his childhood idol, Michael Jackson, and the tight choreography of K-pop. His first album, Shall We Start?, sold more than 100,000 copies, no small achievement in a limited market. Local businesses vie to endorse Ablajan, and his face graces billboards in Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi. For Uighur youth growing up amid marginalization and strife, Ablajan’s story is the stuff of legend. Born and raised in a mud-brick courtyard in one of China’s poorest and most isolated counties, unable to speak Chinese or English until his teens, and lacking training and connections in the music industry, Ablajan somehow made it. To his fans, he symbolizes the possibility of a life that is at once modern, successful and Uighur. He often gives free shows and, during performances, tells kids to study hard and get a good job. “The message is that this is the 21st century,” says Ablajan. “We cannot make a living buying and selling sheep.” Now Ablajan wants to take his music east to the Chinese heartland. He sees his story as proof that there is more to Xinjiang than what you read in the news. He is right, of course, but Xinjiang is a region on edge, and conflict has a way of creeping in. When my Chinese colleague Gu Yongqiang and I returned to our hotel after visiting Ablajan’s childhood stomping grounds, the police were at the door. They thanked us for coming and asked us to be on our way. Said one cop: “It’s a sensitive time.” China’s Outsiders Unlike the country’s majority Han Chinese, Uighurs are of Turkic origin and mostly Muslim. As with Tibet, Xinjiang is historically a contested space, held by a series of Turkic, Mongol and Han empires, including the 18th century Qing Dynasty, which gave the region its current name, meaning “New Frontier.” In the 1930s, Uighur leaders in the ancient Silk Road entrepôt of Kashgar declared the first of two short-lived East Turkestan Republics. When the People’s Republic of China (PRC) came into being, its troops marched into Xinjiang, followed by waves of military personnel and migrants to settle a territory three times the size of France. In 1949, the year the PRC was founded, Han Chinese accounted for roughly 6% of Xinjiang’s population; today the figure is about 45%. Uighurs say they are outsiders in their own land. While Beijing has brought development to Xinjiang, most of the new wealth is concentrated in Han hands. Many Uighurs want greater autonomy, some call for independence. The ruling Chinese Communist Party views those demands as an existential threat. In recent years, any unrest has been met with ever escalating force by Beijing. In 2009, protests in Urumqi degenerated into clashes that claimed nearly 200 lives, both Han and Uighur. The authorities responded by detaining Uighurs and cutting off the Internet for nine months. They have since further curbed the teaching of the Uighur language in schools, banned under-18s from praying in mosques, and stopped civil servants and students from fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. On Sept. 23, Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti, a moderate activist, was sentenced to life imprisonment for “separatism,” a charge many say was trumped up and a verdict many condemn as excessively harsh. Such government action has radicalized some Uighurs. In October last year, a vehicle carrying three members of a Uighur family crashed through crowds of sightseers in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, killing five, including the passengers. Some months later, eight knife-wielding assailants—whom the authorities called “Xinjiang separatists”—slaughtered 29 civilians at a railway station in Kunming, capital of southwestern Yunnan province. Two subsequent attacks by extremists in Urumqi killed dozens more and sparked what Beijing calls an anti-terror campaign that has resulted in mass trials, convictions and executions. On Sept. 22, state media said that blasts in Luntai County, which is about a day’s drive from Urumqi, killed at least two people and injured several others. Security personnel in riot gear now blanket Xinjiang’s major cities, and towns like Sangzhu are increasingly sealed off by police checkpoints. Chinese security posters feature racist caricatures of Uighurs: scowling, bearded men with big hooked noses—reinforcing the perception many Han have of Uighurs as backward, dissolute and violent. It’s against this backdrop of suspicion and prejudice that Ablajan—and other young Uighurs—try to climb the economic ladder. Rhythm and Blues When we landed in Urumqi, two members of Ablajan’s crew, the improbably named Frank and Caesar, met us at the airport and led us to a black SUV. As Frank steered the beast through rush hour traffic, Caesar talked, in rapid-fire Uighur, English and Chinese, about competing as breakdancer in southern China, and lamented that the central government blocks sites like YouTube where you can listen to rap artists like his personal favorite, Notorious B.I.G., “may he rest in peace.” Most of Ablajan’s dancers and aides are, like him, Uighur kids from the countryside who dreamed of making it big. They live between worlds, learning Chinese to survive, and English as a cultural lubricant, while still clinging to a language and tradition of their own. Ablajan attended Uighur-language school and spent his evenings toiling beside his father in the fields, singing folk songs to pass the time. He looks back fondly on his youth. “Xinjiang used to be peaceful,” he says. “Then we lost the peace.” At 14, Ablajan caught a glimpse of Michael Jackson on TV and, for the first time, imagined a life outside Sangzhu. “When I saw him, I was like, Oh my God,” he says. He started practicing the moonwalk and writing songs, and at 19 made the 32-hour bus journey to Urumqi to study dance. The next six years were a struggle to make it as a musician, and a struggle with the reality of being poor and Uighur in an increasingly expensive, segregated city. He worked as a wedding singer and practiced English and Chinese. Eventually, he was befriended by another young Uighur musician who gave him a computer, his first, and a workspace in his studio. He spent his days writing music and his nights working Urumqi’s restaurant and wedding circuit. One of his breakthrough hits, “Is There Space to Play?,” turns rural-urban migration into a metaphor for coming of age, according to Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Washington who studies and translates Uighur music. The song opens with the sights and sounds of Xinjiang childhood: the call to prayer, distant mountains, a bleating goat. By midway, we’re in China’s pressure-cooker schools, where the bags of books are heavy. It ends in the city—skyscrapers and cars are everywhere. Where are the stars at night? Is there space to play? Hot Ticket  Ablajan is a big star in a small place. When he walks down the street, there’s an endless stream of people waiting to shake hands. At a Chinese Muslim restaurant in Urumqi, two cooks rush out of the kitchen, aprons and, gloves still on, to wish him well: “Peace be upon you,” they say, using the pan-Islamic greeting. In the town of Hotan, a teenage taxi driver refuses to let him pay. “Just write some more love songs,” he says. With success and celebrity comes perks that young Ablajan might not have imagined. He has enough to live on his own and to send money and gifts to his family. When he visits his hometown he takes a flight, not the grueling overnight bus. And Uighur girls from as far away as Europe and the U.S. send him messages on Instagram, his social network of choice. “So many beautiful ladies,” he says. But Ablajan also faces obstacles. Many of his fans do not have the money to buy tickets for his shows, and organizing a concert requires multiple layers of state approval. There are technical issues too. For a late spring performance at a college in Urumqi, his team set up a stage on a basketball court and students carried in wooden chairs to form an ad-hoc auditorium. Police lined the perimeter to watch the crowd. When the music started — two hours late because of technical problems — Ablajan was electric. But the guy manning the spotlight from a Toyota pickup mid-court could not quite keep him illuminated. After the show, the performers gathered in the school stairwell that served as their dressing room. The dancers greeted friends and basked in the post-show glow, but Ablajan held back, despondent about the delays and glitches. He worries about letting people down, he says, and feels the pressure of being a role model to an entire generation of Uighur kids. “I’m only a bad boy on stage,” he said. When we met the next morning to catch a flight south, he looked beat. I had bought tickets for 8:00 a.m. not realizing that half the region ignores government-mandated “Beijing time” in favor of “Xinjiang time,” which is two hours earlier. It was actually 5:00 o’clock in the morning and Ablajan had been up all night, replaying the performance in his head. But by time we got to the airport, he was himself again, greeting fans and cracking jokes. As we boarded the plane, Ablajan was humming the tune to a 2013 hit by Toronto-born rapper Drake: Started from the bottom and now we here / Started from the bottom now the whole team here. The Politics of Music Ablajan rarely talks politics, wary, no doubt, of jeopardizing his career. But on July 31, violent clashes erupted in a village outside Kashgar, leaving at least 100 dead, according to state media reports. (The cause of the violence and the death toll are still disputed.) When the authorities then canceled a long-planned concert in Urumqi, Ablajan could no longer hold back. His team spent nearly a month, and a whole lot of money, preparing for what was to be a display of ethnic unity performed in front of officials and broadcast to audiences. Police shut it down less than an hour from showtime. Ablajan posted a picture of himself on Instagram, with a caption that read like a cri de coeur: “My name is Ablajan! I am not a terrorist.” Late last year, Ablajan released his first Chinese-language music video, “Today,” an MJ-inspired epic featuring a car chase and shots of his entourage dancing on rooftops and roads in Urumqi and Kashgar. The goal was to generate some excitement online for the Mandarin single, his first, giving him a foothold in the bigger, more lucrative Chinese-language market. His manager, Rui Wenbin—a Han Chinese born and raised in Urumqi and formerly of Xinjiang’s culture ministry—believes Ablajan’s music can help bridge the divide between the Uighur and Han worlds. Says Rui: “He can be a messenger of peace.” It won’t be easy. On my last night in Xinjiang, Ablajan and I walk to a public square near the local government office. It’s a warm evening and many people are out, walking arm-in-arm or pushing strollers. On one side, a group of elderly Han women practices a synchronized dance. Nearby, clusters of young Uighurs listen to music. Before the clock strikes nine, however, the cops come out in golf-cart-size squad cars, sirens blaring. Everyone has to go home. As we walk back, Ablajan talks about going to Kazakhstan in the fall. If he can scrape up the money, he’d love to see Beijing someday too. “I need proper equipment, a choreographer, costumes, but …” He pauses and searches for the right expression. “Mei banfa,” he says in Mandarin: No solution. “I mean, this is Xinjiang, man.” — With reporting by Gu Yongqiang / Sangzhu Write to Emily Rauhala / Sangzhu at emily_rauhala@timeasia.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3172636/china-uighur-terror-attacks-executions/", "http://time.com/3082988/china-xinjiang-uighur-kashgar/", "http://time.com/3422552/illham-tohti-jewher-illham-china/", "http://time.com/3078381/china-xinjiang-violence-shache-yarkand/"], "sentiment_score": 0.06848982400246444, "subjectivity_score": 0.35289907501986173},

Last night, T-Swift disavowed her country roots and announced she was putting out an all-pop album, beginning with the single “Shake It Off.” In some ways, “Shake It Off” is classic Taylor. Her whole persona is that of an awkward high school nerd (“she’s cheer captain and I’m on the bleachers“) who happened to make it big by crying on her guitar. Never mind that she’s beautiful and one of six women in the entire world that can pull off red lipstick. Every girl can relate to Taylor: she falls in love—hard; she gets her heart broken; she has a sleepover with her girlfriends and regains confidence; she becomes strong and independent; she falls in love again. Rinse and repeat. In short, “We’re happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time.” “Shake It Off” was pulled out of the empowerment part of that cycle: this time the tune shakes off all the haters’ insults. But the song also attempts to make her even more mainstream. She’s not even a little bit country: she’s the dictionary definition of pop star. What can we expect from a new T-Swift album? Think the sonic version of drinking a pumpkin spice latte in Uggs while watching Sex and the City. We saw this coming two years ago with “22.” In fact, loving Taylor Swift and the song “22” is a large portion of BuzzFeed’s “How Basic Are You?” quiz, as is Diet Coke—for which Swift is the spokesperson! (For the uninitiated, someone who is basic is cliché, conformist and predictable without any sense of irony. Here’s a great explainer.) But Red tenuously held on to some folksy roots. That and her adorable awkwardness kept her from being Katy Perry. Now Swift is pulling an anti-Miley Cyrus. Sure, they are both re-appropriating twerking in a way that some of their critics have said is racist. But Cyrus shakes her (less than curvy) booty to try to be rebellious. In “Shake It Off” Swift looks like she contemplates doing the same for a second and then laughs. That’s not her. She’s never going to sing about doing Molly or straddle anything naked. And she’s not going to differentiate herself with country music either. Instead she’s naming her album 1989, in honor of the year she was born because nostalgia is pretty basic too. She called the album a “rebirth” in the livestream announcing its release date (October 27, in case you were wondering), but the only thing new about it so far is that this single sounds like it could have just as easily come from Ariana Grande or any other Nickelodeon star. During the Q&A portion of the livestream Swift said, “All of what I decide to do on albums is based on what I think you will like.” And since her fans are tweens, they like basic things. It’s not particularly interesting. But it’s catchy. And, oh, will it sell. There’s a reason Ariana Grande is topping the charts right now. Sure, being unique can be profitable: Miley Cyrus totally changes her image and has a hit with Bangerz; Beyoncé drops a surprise album and breaks the Internet. But it’s also a risk: the common reaction to Lorde’s refreshing candidness has been “she’ll grow out of it”; and even though Kanye West’s Yeezus, an album that dared fans to like something strange and completely different from his earlier work, was critically acclaimed, it didn’t sell all that well (by Kanye standards). Pumpkin Spice Lattes, on the other hand, will always sell. And that’s okay because pumpkin flavored things are delicious, and I’ve already listened to “Shake It Off” a dozen times.   Write to Eliana Dockterman at eliana.dockterman@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3138525/taylor-swift-shake-it-off-1989/"], "sentiment_score": 0.13054898058930317, "subjectivity_score": 0.5280063305869758},

The proposed merger, which would combine the two largest cable companies in the U.S. and create an unprecedented entertainment and communications colossus, is fiercely opposed by many consumer advocacy groups. Critics of the deal say the merger would concentrate too much market power in the hands of a single media giant, potentially harming competitors and offering scant benefits for consumers. On Tuesday, more than 50 public interest groups sent a letter to the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission in which they called the deal “unthinkable” and urged U.S. regulators to block it. The intense debate about the proposed merger underscores the rapid changes sweeping across the media landscape as broadband Internet service becomes the signature communications medium of the 21st century. Tens of millions of Americans communicate, conduct business, and consume content using Internet-based technologies like email, instant messaging, video chat, social networks, voice-over-IP phone service, and streaming entertainment options like Netflix, Amazon and Spotify. Federal approval of the deal would amount to a resounding triumph for Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, whose father founded the company in 1963 by buying a 1,200-subscriber cable TV company in Tupelo, Miss. for $500,000. Comcast, which now employs 136,000 people and has a market value of $130 billion, already owns NBCUniversal, one of the crown jewels of the entertainment industry, after buying the company from industrial conglomerate General Electric. On Wednesday, Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and argued that the deal won’t harm competitors or consumers. On the contrary, Cohen said the deal is actually great for consumers, who will benefit from faster Internet speeds, enhanced broadband services, and improved user interface technology. Comcast has also pledged to extend its “net neutrality” commitment to Time Warner Cable customers, and expand a program that pushes broadband access in low income areas into Time Warner Cable markets. (MORE: Comcast’s Time Warner Cable Deal is ‘Unthinkable,’ Critics Say) Several lawmakers have expressed concern about the deal, including Sen. Al Franken (D—Mn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. “I have serious reservations about this proposed transaction, which would consolidate the largest and second largest cable providers in America,” Franken wrote in a recent letter to regulators. “Unfortunately, a handful of cable providers dominate the market, leaving consumers with little choice but to pay high bills for often unsatisfactory service. I am concerned that Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner would only make things worse for consumers.” On Tuesday, Comcast filed its 180-page Public Interest Statement with the FCC, which is charged with ensuring that the deal serves the public interest. “We expect a rigorous review as we’ve had in our previous deals, and believe an objective weighing of the significant public interest benefits that are offered by this transaction and the lack of competitive concerns should lead to approval,” Cohen wrote in a corporate blog post. If the deal is approved, Comcast would command nearly 40% of the high speed wire line broadband Internet market in the U.S. Critics say that allowing one company to control the pipes bringing high-speed Internet access into the homes of four out of ten U.S. broadband subscribers would give Comcast an alarming amount of power over consumers and competitors alike. (Time Warner Cable was spun off from TIME parent Time Warner in 2009.) Cohen dismisses such concerns. “This transaction is all about increasing competition and creating more consumer benefit as a result of gaining additional scale,” he said in a recent interview with C-SPAN. Comcast says that the deal isn’t anticompetitive because the two companies don’t compete for cable customers in the same markets. “Customers will still have the same number of video, broadband, or phone options before the deal as after it,” Cohen wrote in the blog post. Comcast says the deal will help it address competitive threats not just from traditional phone and satellite firms like AT&T, Verizon, DirecTV, and DISH, but also from Internet companies like Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook. “Internet and device companies, with newfound global scale, also are competing aggressively in the video marketplace and in the larger broadband value circle,” Cohen wrote, pointing to initiatives like Google Fiber, Apple TV, and Amazon’s recently announced Fire TV set-top box. One thing that Comcast is not promising is lower prices for consumers. “We’re certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly,” Cohen told reporters when the deal was announced. The implication of this statement is that any cost savings that Comcast is able to achieve, either through increased scale or enhanced buying power, would go directly to the company’s bottom line or be invested back into the business. It’s possible, but by no means certain, that such investment will benefit consumers, through advances in broadband speed and technology. But the people most likely to benefit from of any enhancement of Comcast’s already formidable competitive position in the marketplace will surely be the company’s shareholders.

Amazon also includes a Netflix-like streaming video service containing 40,000 movies and TV shows – some popular, most not. You also get the ability to digitally borrow half a million eligible Kindle books one at a time. More info here. This is all very unscientific, back-of-the-napkin math, but here are some stats and assumptions about my 2013 orders. Basic Stats:   I placed 76 orders last year, but some of these orders were multiple different orders placed on the same day or Subscribe-and-Save orders, which are basically discounted subscriptions to items that get shipped out on a set schedule (paper towels, batteries, detergent and things like that). So when the dust had cleared, I ended up getting 62 shipments last year. Of those shipments, exactly half were orders that totaled less than $35. Amazon offers free shipping if you spend $35 or more. Extra Shipping Charges:   I had five items overnighted at $3.99 per item ($19.95 total), I paid $79 for the membership, and I bought one item that wasn’t eligible for Prime shipping. It was a t-shirt that carried $5.49 in additional shipping costs. I have no regrets about buying this shirt. None whatsoever. So: $19.95 plus $79 plus $5.49 comes out to $104.44 – the total amount I paid for shipping last year on all my Amazon purchases. Cost of Overnighting the Same 5 Items Without Prime:   I would have incurred $96.89 worth of shipping costs just for the five items I chose to overnight. That’s before even getting into how much I would have paid in shipping charges for orders totaling less than $35. However, I can look you straight in the eye and tell you that there’s no way I would have overnighted a single one of these items if I hadn’t been able to do so for $3.99 apiece. I probably wouldn’t have purchased any of these items from Amazon in the first place. The two wigs (see above photo) are my biggest regrets for several reasons, but I know deep down in the cockles of my heart that having them on-hand will someday pay off in spades. I didn’t need to overnight either of them, though. Standard Shipping Costs Without Prime:   I fudged the numbers a bit here: I had a few orders that were shy of $35 by less than a buck, and a smattering of orders staggered within a day of each other. In a non-Prime life, I would have found something dinky to make a $34 order clear $35 and I would have been more vigilant about placing larger orders that qualified for free shipping. So I didn’t count those orders in my 2013 totals. But for the rest of the one-off, sub-$35 items I ordered, I would have paid around $112 in shipping costs. Assumptions, Advice and Conclusion: I’m surprised at how close these two realities are. In a Prime life, I paid $104.44 in shipping charges; in a non-Prime life, I would have paid $112.15 in shipping charges. In my case, I actually have to think a bit about whether $99 is worth it. Prime was a no-brainer for me at $79, but if I buckled down and made sure to order things only in $35-and-up clumps, I could conceivably cut shipping costs out of the equation altogether. (I’d still pay $5.49 extra for that shirt – all day long. No regrets.) What such a scenario doesn’t take into account, of course, is that Prime offers two-day shipping, whereas standard shipping is listed at five to eight days. If you live in a populated area that’s relatively close to an Amazon distribution center, however, I can tell you that a standard shipment generally shows up in three days. At least, that’s been my case (I live in Boston). It also doesn’t take into account the free movies and TV shows, or the free Kindle books. You could make the argument that if Amazon has the same stuff you want to watch as Netflix does, you could save $8 a month on a Netflix membership and basically offset the yearly cost of Prime. I also happened to read more Kindle books this year thanks to my Prime membership, but I can’t argue that I would have paid full price for any of them otherwise. My colleague Brad Tuttle lays out 5 ways to skirt paying $99 for Prime, the least cumbersome being to sign up for an educational discount if you have a .edu email address, or being diligent about placing $35+ orders. I’ll also add that you can share a full-price Prime membership with four other people (Prime members: see the “Invite a Household Member” section on this page), so round up four friends – sorry, “household members” — and everyone can chip in $20. And now the big question: Will I be re-upping my membership at $99 this time around? Yes. Yes, I will. Being able to pay $4 to overnight a wig I’ll probably never use is worth it to me. So is not having to look around for stuff to pad a $34 order. The two-day shipping on everything else, coupled with the video and e-book extras is icing on the cake. But finally running the numbers after all these years has left me feeling less like Prime is a must-buy, especially now that it costs $99. If the price goes up any higher, I think that’ll be it for me.

The box is slimmer than a dime (standing up, that is), and can either sit in an entertainment center or mount behind the television. A small Bluetooth remote has a handful of buttons for media playback and navigation, similar to an Apple TV remote, but it also has a microphone for voice search. As with Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets, the software is partly based on Android, but it also uses HTML to support easy porting of apps from other television platforms. Apps for Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube, WatchESPN, MLB.tv, NBA, Crackle, Bloomberg TV and others will be supported at launch, and of course Amazon will have its own services on board, such as Amazon Prime Instant video and a store for purchasing and renting videos. Beyond video, Fire TV will stream music from users’ Amazon libraries and from streaming apps such as Pandora, iHeartRadio and TuneIn. Users can view photos as well, as long as they’re stored in Amazon’s Cloud Drive services. Kindle Fire users can see information about what’s on the TV using Amazon’s “X-Ray” feature. Users will get a notification on their tablets, letting them tap to learn about actors and other information on a video, and see lyrics for music. Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service is supported as well, allowing parents to set time limits for their children and get recommendations on kid-friendly content. As rumored, Fire TV will have a gaming component, and Amazon lists Disney, Gameloft, 2K, Ubisoft and Double Fine as some of the publishers that are on board. An optional Fire Game Controller will sell for $40, but users can also play games through the remote control or with a companion phone and tablet app. The games are mostly adaptations of mobile titles, such as Gameloft’s Asphalt 8, Minecraft Pocket Edition and Disney’s Monsters University; many are free to play, and the average price of a paid game is around $1.85. Amazon did recently acquire a game studio, Double Helix, and Amazon is now building games specifically for the Fire TV and Kindle Fire tablets. One example Amazon demonstrated is Sev Zero, a third-person shooter that includes some tower defense elements. (Amazon’s website shows how a second player can use a Kindle Fire tablet to view the map, collect resources and launch air strikes.) Fire TV’s components are similar to that of a smartphone or tablet, with a quad-core processor, a dedicated graphics processor, 2 GB of RAM and dual-band Wi-Fi. It supports 1080p video and offers Dolby Digital Plus Surround Sound via HDMI or optical output. Amazon says it set out to fix a few common complaints with existing TV boxes: Performance can be laggy, search is too difficult on a typical remote control, and closed ecosystems don’t always offer the services users want. The Fire TV’s powerful specs and remote control microphone may solve the first two problems, but with the exception of Apple TV, many other set-top boxes are open to competing music and video services. Still, the gaming element is a unique feature, and the focus on a simple, speedy interface could help Amazon stand out. Amazon’s Fire TV costs $99—same as an Apple TV, but twice the price of the cheapest Roku device—and is shipping today.

The state-run People’s Daily newspaper said Zhou Shifeng, director of the Beijing-based Fengrui Law Firm, which was the government’s primary target, admitted in custody that the firm was engaged in “criminal activities,” the South China Morning Post reported. “I condoned and encouraged these unlawful activities … and these have an impact on social stability,” Zhou allegedly told his interrogators. “I have unshirkable responsibilities.” Zhou is among 14 human-rights lawyers and advocates that remain in custody, after more than 200 were swept up in a sudden crackdown last week. Six others are missing. The Chinese government accused the detainees of conspiring with “a major criminal gang” in order to “draw attention to sensitive cases, seriously disturbing social order.” Editorials in various Chinese dailies slammed the “radical lawyers” on Monday; the People’s Daily said that “the confessions of several of the [lawyers] outline how they abused their influence to hype a legal case into a public or mass incident.” However, legal analysts and experts said these confessions are often extracted under coercion and torture. William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International, told the Post he was concerned the detainees had been forced to confess. Whether forced or not, Nee added that the confessions, coupled with the Chinese media’s portrayal of the lawyers as criminals, “calls into question whether they can get fair trials.” Write to Rishi Iyengar at rishi.iyengar@timeasia.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3954935/china-arrests-lawyers-human-rights/"], "sentiment_score": 0.011151960784313719, "subjectivity_score": 0.2813725490196078},

A statement from the police said that the Interpol liaison office of China’s Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department had informed them that Paul Lee, also known as Lee Bo, was in their custody. The revelation strengthens local suspicions that Lee, a British citizen who disappeared in early January, was snatched from Hong Kong by mainland Chinese authorities in flagrant violation of Hong Kong’s autonomy. The case has attracted widespread international attention amid concerns that Beijing is widening is dragnet to harass and detain dissidents beyond mainland Chinese borders. Lee and three still missing men are all connected to Mighty Current Media, a publishing company that specializes in books containing salacious details of the lives of top Chinese Communist Party officials. A co-owner of the firm, Swedish citizen Gui Minhai, appears to have been abducted from his holiday home in Thailand last October. He suddenly resurfaced on Chinese state television Monday making what seems to be a scripted confession of his desire to return to China to face punishment for a drink-driving accident supposedly committed in 2003. Hong Kong police added that they have requested their Chinese counterparts to allow them to meet Lee and “further understand the situation.” Write to Rishi Iyengar at rishi.iyengar@timeasia.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4170605/lee-bo-disappearance-bookseller-china-hong-kong/", "http://time.com/4167210/hong-kong-china-sage-publisher-bookseller-lee-bo-missing/", "http://time.com/4184324/gui-minhai-dissident-search/", "http://time.com/4183967/hong-kong-publisher-gui-minhai-mmighty-current-china/"], "sentiment_score": 0.049999999999999996, "subjectivity_score": 0.31388888888888894},

The case of Swedish national Gui Minhai has caused widespread fear and alarm in Hong Kong, where it is widely speculated that he was abducted from his Thai vacation by mainland Chinese agents on account of his company’s specialization in works highly critical of Chinese Communist Party leaders. Gui is one of five people from Mighty Current Media to have gone missing in recent weeks. All are suspected to be in arbitrary detention in China. In a bizarre twist, Gui told the official CCTV news channel that he was giving himself up for what the state claims is a drunk-driving conviction 11 years ago, in which he is said to have killed a student and for which Xinhua claims he had been given a suspended two-year sentence. “Turning myself in is a voluntary choice of my own, and has nothing to do with anybody else,” he is said to have told officials at a detention center earlier in the week. Xinhua adds that Gui had, in effect, renounced his Swedish nationality. “Deep down I still think of myself as a Chinese,” he is supposed to have said. “My roots are in China. I hope the Swedish authorities would respect my personal choices.” The state-run news agency also claims that Gui told officials that he was “willing to accept any punishment.” Authorities in Sweden meanwhile reacted to the detained publisher’s sudden reappearance with cautious incredulity, with the country’s Deputy Finance Minister telling the South China Morning Post that the “easiest way” to resolve the situation would be to allow Swedish representatives to meet Gui themselves. “We encourage the Chinese authorities to show us much openness, and provide information and contact between the Swedish authorities and the detainee,” Per Bolund told the Post on the sidelines of the Asia Financial Forum in Hong Kong on Monday, adding that the Sweden government “is quite concerned about the development.” The Swedish government had earlier summoned the ambassadors of China and Thailand over Gui’s case and the case of a Swedish human-rights worker detained in Beijing. Hong Kong’s top official, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, maintained that his government’s hands were tied when it came to Gui because formal reports had not been made. “The Gui Minhai case has not been reported to the Hong Kong police or the government,” Leung said. However, the Post says that local police officers had visited Gui’s apartment in Hong Kong earlier this month to make inquiries. Gui’s daughter Angela rubbished the notion that her father had submitted to Chinese detention voluntarily. “I do still believe he was abducted,” she told the Guardian via telephone from the U.K. “I still think it is suspicious that he and his associates went missing.” As for the purported crime he confessed to on Chinese television, she said she could neither confirm nor deny that it had occurred. “Even if it is true, I don’t think that is why he is there,” she said.

A future book was titled, with characteristic relish, The Pimps of the Chinese Communist Party, another The Inside Story of the Chinese First Lady. But one title was notably missing from Gui’s to-do list, even though several of his confidantes say it was the naturalized Swedish citizen’s biggest project of the year, one that may have gotten him in serious trouble with the Chinese government: a tell-all — who knows how truthful? — of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rumored female liaisons. On Jan. 17, Gui showed up on Chinese TV in a video that would have strained belief as a plot point in his best-selling but, at times, questionably sourced books detailing scandal — political and sexual — among China’s ruling elite. In the video, Gui, a Manchurian with broad shoulders and thick hair, slumps forward, face crumpling, as he says he returned to China to face justice for a fatal drunk-driving accident in his eastern Chinese hometown of Ningbo 12 years ago. Distancing himself from his Swedish citizenship, which the onetime poet picked up during exile after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, Gui says, in a monotone: “Although I have Swedish citizenship, I truly feel that I am still Chinese and my roots are in China. So I wish the Swedish government will respect my personal choice, respects my rights and privacy and let me solve my own problems.” Gui’s current Swedish passport, which was issued by the Swedish consulate in Hong Kong, expires next year. The tearful confession was Gui’s first appearance since the 51-year-old vanished on Oct. 17 from outside the gates of his seaside condominium in the Thai beach town of Pattaya. Four other men associated with Gui’s Mighty Current Media have also disappeared, most recently Lee Bo, Gui’s business partner. Lee, who holds a British passport, was last seen on Dec. 30 in Hong Kong, where he and his wife ran a bookshop hawking hundreds of salacious political accounts to curious visiting mainland Chinese. There is no official record of Lee exiting the former British colony, which is governed by different laws from the rest of China. Yet days after Lee’s disappearance, a fax in his handwriting was sent out, explaining that he had used his “own methods” to travel to the mainland and was busy assisting in an unnamed investigation. The faxed letter went on to say: “I am very well. Everything is fine.” The other three individuals disappeared while traveling in southern China on separate occasions and have not been seen in public since. Faxed and videotaped reassurances notwithstanding, the fact that five people associated with a politically sensitive publisher have all disappeared certainly seems suspicious. Is the Chinese state now in the business of kidnapping abroad? Since taking power around three years ago, President Xi has cracked down on dissent, locking up hundreds of freethinkers and cementing his reputation as China’s most powerful leader in decades. Everyone from the nation’s top female lawyer to a moderate Muslim academic has been swept up. Most have been jailed on what human-rights experts consider suspect charges, either oversize crimes like subversion of state power or seemingly unconnected infractions such as disturbing traffic. Xi’s campaign feels both brutal and brittle — a powerful ruling party spooked by a collection of unarmed poets, feminists and lawyers, few of whom are calling for an end to communist rule. Xi may have come to power vowing to strengthen China’s commitment to rule of law but on Monday a group of high-profile foreign lawyers and heads of bar associations directly criticized the Chinese President for intimidating or detaining hundreds of Chinese lawyers, along with their staff and families. Some of China’s detentions have been accompanied by videos in which journalists, activists and bloggers, among others, are paraded on Chinese state TV admitting to a variety of alleged crimes. The coerced feel of the confessions gives an impression less of due process and more of state control. In one example, Gui, whose shirt mysteriously changes color partway through his televised repentance, says: “I don’t want any individual and any organizations interfering with my return or hyping it maliciously.” It is a peculiar sentiment — and a familiar one. Lee’s fax used a similar formulation. With Beijing’s dragnet expanding abroad, to include what appears to be both Chinese and Chinese-born foreign citizens, panic is setting in among communities that once considered foreign soil safe ground. Last year, shortly after Gui’s disappearance, Thailand, which now counts China as its largest trading partner, deported two Chinese dissidents who were soon to be resettled in a third country with help from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The extraditions back to China earned the Thai government a sharp rebuke from the U.N. and Western governments. “I thought once I escaped China I would be safe,” says one Chinese dissident, as she waits in Bangkok for a UNHCR hearing to determine whether she will be classified as a political refugee. After more than a dozen of her activist friends were detained in China as part of Xi’s human-rights crackdown, she paid smugglers to transport her through three countries to Thailand. Now she worries about the unknown Mandarin-speaking men who have been tailing her in Bangkok for weeks. “If I disappear tomorrow, you will have no doubt about who took me. The [Chinese] Communist Party is too powerful.” If Gui was planning to return to China to face up to his troubled conscience, he gave no public signal of an impending life change At his spacious Pattaya condominium, which he bought around a year ago, a new cabinet delivered days after his disappearance stands in the middle of the room, swaddled in plastic. On a desk, which afforded Gui an expansive view of the Gulf of Thailand, two days-of-the-week pillboxes sit, still filled with medicine for the days following his disappearance. On a nearby table, a bag filled with Gui’s swimming gear rests, awaiting his usual daily swim. Gui was out grocery shopping on Oct. 17 when a man speaking broken Thai and no English showed up at the gate of the Silver Beach condominium. (His image was recorded on the building’s CCTV.) When Gui eventually returned, he asked the compound’s guard to take his groceries up to his apartment and leave them in the hallway. The two men climbed into Gui’s white hatchback. That was the last sighting of the publisher of up to half of the pulp political books available in Hong Kong. (Mighty Current Media’s books are so popular that some Asian airports stock them in prime display spaces, even if spot checks at Chinese customs can get the books’ new owners in trouble.) For a couple weeks, Gui kept in contact with condo employee Pisamai Phumulna by phone, much as he did when he was in Hong Kong and needed her help in watering plants or ensuring bills were paid. Later on Oct. 17, he called, asking her to put the groceries — smoked salmon, bread and eggs, among other food — in the fridge. Then, in early November he rang again, saying that friends would be coming by to pick up a few things from his home and to please let them in. Four men showed up, one wearing a straw hat and sunglasses. Two spoke native Thai, while the other two only spoke Mandarin. The four registered in the building’s log with a common Chinese name, He Wei, written in Chinese. Their images were also recorded on the building’s CCTV. The four men stayed in Gui’s apartment for less than half an hour and took, at the very least, a laptop that had been on his desk. The printer’s cartridge also appears missing. Apart from shelves lined with copies of Mighty Current’s books, such as The Mystery of Xi’s Family Fortune and The Dark History of the Red Emperor, the apartment now contains not a single document connected to his work. It’s not clear if his Pattaya holiday home ever housed such papers although Gui often edited and commissioned new books while in Thailand, according to two of his writers who live in the U.S. They both believe he was soon to publish a book about Xi’s past female companions. (Xi is married to his second wife Peng Liyuan, a former singer in the People’s Liberation Army who was for many years far more famous than her husband.) As he left, one of the men joked to Pisamai that Gui had lots of girlfriends and had probably neglected to return to his condo because he had been diverted by his latest love affair. Pisamai had never seen him bring any woman home — other than his second wife, who lives in Germany, and his daughter, who lives in England. But this was Pattaya, infamous for its sex trade and easy morals. She giggled. Shortly afterward, some of Gui’s friends became worried, particularly because he had failed to communicate with printers about an upcoming book. One friend contacted Pisamai. When Gui called her next in mid-November, again from an unknown foreign number, she told him his family was concerned. He hung up and never called again. Pisamai called the number of one of the four men who had visited Gui’s condo. A taxi driver picked up, saying the men had left the phone in his car on their way to a Cambodian border town. Despite Pisamai visiting a local police station, not to mention the public outcry early this year following his business partner Lee’s disappearance from Hong Kong, no Thai or Swedish authorities have visited his Pattaya apartment. Last week, the Swedish government summoned the Chinese and Thai ambassadors to ask about Gui’s case, as well as the detention of another Swedish citizen in Beijing who had founded an NGO aiding human-rights defenders. Meanwhile, in Gui’s Pattaya apartment, a poem by William Butler Yeats, “When You Are Old,” is filed away, among quotidian notes-to-self to buy medicine and tweak wi-fi routers. Gui studied history at China’s prestigious Peking University, and fellow poet Bei Ling, who was once jailed in China before going into exile overseas, remembers a passionate young man who thrilled at the power of words. In the mid-1980s, at a time when unauthorized translations of Kafka could be a crime, Gui and other Beijing poets sneaked into foreign salons and read whatever samizdat Western literature they could find. As censorship loosened by the late 1980s, Gui studied comparative literature and published a book called A Guide to Twentieth Century Western Cultural History. Then the Tiananmen massacre forestalled further political reform in China for years. Somewhere along the way, Gui, living first in Sweden and later Germany and Hong Kong, discovered the profitable business of selling gossipy political tell-alls. (The more esoteric literary efforts of his publishing house failed to sell well.) He built up a stable of Chinese writers, some former poets and essayists who now live abroad, and authored some books himself. Over the years, Gui’s publishing company churned out hundreds of tales of Chinese sex and scandal. “Maybe some of the information you can’t check,” acknowledges one writer. “It’s more important that it’s a good story.” Gui made enough money to buy his Pattaya pad for $430,000. Gui’s writers are now jittery. If the Mighty Current five have all ended up detained in China, what safety is guaranteed for the publishing house’s authors? Chinese dissidents, particularly those in Thailand, are also nervous, given the recent deportation of the two Chinese activists, one of whom dabbled in caricatures of President Xi. (They were both arrested upon being extradited to China.) Indeed, some of Gui’s friends suspect he may have been repatriated on the same chartered plane that took the dissident pair back home. “The Chinese government is so scared that it has to steal people from abroad,” says Yi Feng, a Chinese dissident and former teacher who arrived in Bangkok on a tourist visa last September, along with his young son. (They have since overstayed their visas and are trying to apply for refugee status through the UNHCR, an often years-long process.) “Maybe the Chinese government has power,” he says, “but they don’t have legitimacy.” — With reporting by Yang Siqi / Beijing Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.046924289846825055, "subjectivity_score": 0.31889496914144805},

But there’s only a handful of tech accessories that we really can’t live without. Here is TIME’s list of 20 types of gadgets that pretty much everybody should have. We’ve also included a few models for each category that we’ve used and we like. Good wireless headphones Wireless headphones are finally getting affordable while delivering quality sound and being comfortable to wear. Check out Apple’s new BeatsX or the Jaybird Freedom Wireless, both of which are solid, workout-friendly options. If you prefer on-ear headphones, try the Jabra Move Wireless. A pair of cheap earbuds Even if you’ve got a nice pair of headphones, it’s a great idea to grab a pair of high-quality but cheap earbuds to throw in your bag and have when you need them. We love these Xiaomi buds, which offer great sound and noise isolation at a remarkably low price. A Bluetooth speaker The latest smartphones can pump out pretty great sound, but they can’t hold a candle to the audio quality from a dedicated Bluetooth speaker. We like the rugged UE Roll 2 for the beach and the pool, but the Bose SoundLink Mini II offers better sound for your living room or kitchen. If audio fidelity isn’t as important to you, you might also consider going with the Amazon Echo, which does double duty as a music speaker and an Internet-connected, voice-activated assistant. A portable smartphone charger It’s a terrible feeling to head out the door without knowing if your smartphone’s battery will survive the night. Get rid of that “range anxiety” with a portable charger, like the Mophie Powerstation Mini. It’ll give you all the extra juice you need without needing to top off at a wall plug. A streaming stick Streaming sticks, which let you beam video content from your phone or computer to your TV, are one of the most useful new gadgets to pop up over the last few years. The Google Chromecast started the trend, but you should also consider the Amazon Fire TV Stick or the Roku Streaming Stick, both of which come with handy remotes. Apple fans might opt for the AirPlay-compatible Apple TV, though it’s more expensive than these options. A decent camera Yes, your smartphone camera is probably pretty good. But it’s still worth owning a standalone digital camera, as I’ve argued before. The Sony RX100 is an incredible little point-and-shoot, though it’s expensive enough that you might as well consider an entry-level DSLR instead. For something a little cheaper, try the Canon PowerShot 350 HS. A GoPro The latest GoPro Hero5 models are remarkable little cameras, made all the more useful by the addition of voice control. I particularly like the smaller, cube-shaped Session, which produces stunning results despite its diminutive size. If you don’t need the latest and greatest video quality and other bells and whistles, the entry-level Hero+ model is a great option as well. Many users have reported that the Chinese-made Yi 4K Action Camera is a fine choice, too. A selfie stick Make fun of them if you want, but nothing this side of a drone can get quality group photos the way a selfie stick can. I like this model, but it doesn’t have any connectivity, meaning you’ll need to use your phone’s auto-timer. If that sounds like too much work, try this one instead. A fitness tracker Want to keep an eye on how many steps you take, miles you walk or stairs you climb in a given day? Try a fitness tracker like the Fitbit Charge 2, Fitbit Alta, or Samsung Gear Fit2. More hardcore athletes should consider higher-end models with GPS and waterproofing, like the Garmin Vivoactive HR. Apple fans, meanwhile, should check out the Apple Watch, which does a great job as a fitness tracker. An e-reader There’s something magical about e-readers like the Amazon Kindle, which can hold hundreds of books with the weight of a magazine. I particularly love mine after a long day of staring at a computer screen, because the e-ink display is more like reading a regular book than a tablet display. A smartphone stand If you work at a computer all day, it’s great to have a little stand for your phone that’ll help keep it charged through the workday. We like the Native Union DOCK+ for the iPhone, while Android users should consider this Belkin stand. A cigarette lighter USB adapter If you’re often on the road, one of these cigarette lighter-to-usb adapters is an incredibly handy tool to stash in your car. This model, meanwhile, does double duty as a Bluetooth receiver and FM transmitter, meaning it can let you use your phone to play tunes in older cars without USB or aux-in cables. A flash drive Despite the rise of cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, sometimes you need to haul big files from one computer to another. That’s when it’s great to have a flash drive, which are getting smaller and cheaper all the time. This SanDisk model is the gold standard, but you can also try something like this, which attaches to your keyring so it’s always with you. There’s even a Swiss Army Knife with a USB drive attached. A backup drive Every hard drive will eventually fail, including the one holding all your files, photos and videos right this instant. Get peace of mind by investing in a backup drive like the Western Digital My Passport, then remember to back up regularly (at least once a month.) Buy a model that has more storage space than your computer to ensure you can do a full backup. A small power strip If you often work from coffeehouses or airport terminals while waiting for a flight, you know that fighting for an open power outlet can be nothing short of a Darwinist struggle. Be a peacemaker of power by packing a small power strip like this one that can turn one open outlet into many. (Bonus: It also includes USB charging ports.) A lost-stuff finder Prone to losing stuff all the time? Grab a Tile Mate and keep it on your eyes, with your phone or in your wallet. Then, you’ll be able to track the location of that item with a map. When you’re close, you can trigger a homing beacon sound to help you locate your wayward goods.   An Amazon Echo or Google Home If you’ve ever dreamed of having the voice-activated computer from Star Trek in your kitchen or living room, you’re in luck: The Amazon Echo and Google Home can answer basic questions, tell you the weather forecast and sports scores, and even request an Uber or Lyft for you. If you’re interested in the Echo, you should also consider its smaller and more affordable cousin, the Echo Dot. (Also be sure to read our ultimate guide to the Amazon Echo.) A super-comfy mouse If you’re upgrading your keyboard, you might as well get a nice, comfy mouse as well. You can’t go wrong with the Logitech Performance Mouse MX, which I’ve used for years. It fits my hand perfectly and you can stash the Bluetooth receiver in the battery compartment for easy transport when you’re working remotely. Apple users should also consider the Magic Mouse 2. A cheap VR viewer The world is suddenly awash in virtual reality and 360 video content. But unless you’re a hardcore gamer, it’s probably not worth investing in a high-end VR headset just yet. Instead, dip your toes (or, uh, eyes) in the water with a Samsung Gear VR or Google Daydream View, both of which are affordable alternatives powered by your smartphone. Home security camera Want to keep an eye on your kingdom when you’re at the office or traveling abroad? Pick up an Internet-connected like the Nest Cam or the Logitech Logi Circle, which work with a smartphone app to become your eyes and ears while you’re out of the house.

Less publicized but just as game-changing, OS X Yosemite, Apple’s new Mac operating system, was released last Thursday as a free upgrade. A major release with an array of features, Yosemite has a lot more than just new graphics and typefaces: the operating system unites Apple’s desktop and mobile devices in ways they’ve never worked together before, for instance. So while you were eyeing that oversized iPhone 6 Plus and ogling that svelte iPad Air 2, here are the five coolest, new OS X features that you missed. 1. Handoff As fun as it is to say phablets are killing tablets or tablets are killing laptops, the reality is that most computer users are carrying around more than one machine. Yosemite’s new Handoff feature gets these multiple devices thinking like one intuitive supercomputer. For example, imagine reading about the World Series in Safari on a Mac Mini, and then turning to check the weather with an iPad. With OS X Yosemite and iOS 8 installed, you’ll find a Safari icon at the bottom left of your iPad’s lock screen, ready to be swiped and take you to the same baseball story in Safari on the tablet. It’s a fantastically fluid feature that works with an array of apps, from productivity software like Numbers and Pages to personal apps like Reminders and Contacts. 2. Desktop Macs Can Make Phone Calls It’s almost 2015 — shouldn’t this new feature be old hat? In a way it is; Skype and Google Voice users have been yapping away for years on Macs. But Yosemite uses a new technology called “Continuity” that uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to link iDevices and Macs owned by the same user in order to push phone calls from iPhones to Apple computers and even iPads. The feature is enabled by default, so it may be a bit jarring the first time your iMac rings. But with all the standard calling features like call waiting, conference calling, and even custom ringtones, it’s a welcome addition to a multi-tasker’s workflow. SMS text messages, not just iMessages, even get displayed in the Messages app, turning your MacBook into a full-fledged smartphone. Still, beware deploying this new feature in an office environment: with computers ringing and people conducting conversations via speakers and microphones, this new feature could get very old, very fast. 3. Safari Gets Private and Secure Prior to Yosemite, Safari’s Private Browsing mode was the best way to ensure Apple’s web browser would keep your secrets. But this operating system release saw an overhaul of the browser, introducing more security features like a custom history clearing option that lets users clear history, cookies, and other data from the previous hour, day, or two days. In addition, Apple has added DuckDuckGo, a non-tracking search engine that doesn’t store users’ data, to its search offerings. And with Continuity features of its own, a Safari browser running on an Apple computer can not only share its history with browsers on associated iPhones and iPads, but it can also close tabs left open on the iOS devices—a great way to ensure people don’t view the browsing habits on your mobile devices. 4. Edit Attachments Directly In the Mail App Little bloats a computer’s hard drive more than email attachments, especially when you need to edit them. Consider this workflow: Save the attachment, edit the saved data, and reattach the updated document — that simple exchange turns one file into three, at least tripling the space it occupies on a hard drive. Yosemite’s Mail app lets users make edits to attachments within the email window through tools that allow text to be inserted, signatures to be doodled with the touchpad, and diagrams to be drawn. It’s a small but necessary feature that is much overdue, and offers a convenience that could finally (hopefully?) spell the end of the fax machine. 5. AirDrop with iOS Speaking of Mail, Yosemite’s Mac to iDevice diplomacy marks the end of another painstaking workaround: emailing files from your mobile device to your desktop. AirDrop is nothing new — introduced in iOS 7, it previously allowed two nearby iDevices to transfer files between each other, wirelessly. But for reasons that only Apple engineers can explain, these handhelds couldn’t send files to Macs — until now. It’s such a simple feature that it hardly feels like magic, but Yosemite’s AirDrop is representative of the overhaul Apple made with this operating system build: Finally, all your machines can interact with each other and it just works.

At IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York State’s Westchester County, scientists always keep a box of dental floss—Reach is the preferred brand—close by in case they need to tinker with their oil-drum-size quantum computers, the latest of which can complete certain tasks millions of times as fast as your laptop. Inside the shimmering aluminum canister of IBM’s System One, which sits shielded by the same kind of protective glass as the Mona Lisa, are three cylinders of diminishing circumference, rather like a set of Russian dolls. Together, these encase a chandelier of looping silver wires that cascade through chunky gold plates to a quantum chip in the base. To work properly, this chip requires super-cooling to 0.015 kelvins—a smidgen above absolute zero and colder than outer space. Most materials contract or grow brittle and snap under such intense chill. But ordinary dental floss, it turns out, maintains its integrity remarkably well if you need to secure wayward wires. “But only the unwaxed, unflavored kind,” says Jay Gambetta, IBM’s vice president of quantum. “Otherwise, released vapors mess everything up.” Buy a print of the Quantum cover here It’s a curiously homespun facet of a technology that is set to transform pretty much everything. Quantum’s unique ability to crunch stacks of data is already optimizing the routes of thousands of fuel tankers traversing the globe, helping decide which ICU patients require the most urgent care, and mimicking chemical processes at the atomic level to better design new materials. It also promises to supercharge artificial intelligence, with the power to better train algorithms that can finally turn driverless cars and drone taxis into a reality. Quantum AI simulations exhibit a “degree of effectiveness and efficiency that is mind-boggling,” U.S. National Cyber Director Chris Inglis tells TIME. Read More: DeepMind’s CEO Helped Take AI Mainstream. Now He’s Urging Caution Quantum’s earliest adopters are asset-management firms—for which incorporating quantum calculations involves few increased overhead costs—but commercial uses aren’t far behind. Spanish firm Multiverse Computing has run successful pilot projects with multinational clients like BASF and Bosch that show its quantum algorithms can double foreign-exchange trading profits and catch almost four times as many production-line defects. “Quantum deep-learning algorithms are completely different from classical ones,” says Multiverse CEO Enrique Lizaso Olmos. “You can train them faster, try more strategies, and they are much better at getting the correlations that matter from a lot of data.” Tech giants from Google to Amazon and Alibaba—not to mention nation-states vying for technological supremacy—are racing to dominate this space. The global quantum-computing industry is projected to grow from $412 million in 2020 to $8.6 billion in 2027, according to an International Data Corp. analysis. Whereas traditional computers rely on binary “bits”—switches either on or off, denoted as 1s and 0s—to process information, the “qubits” that underpin quantum computing are tiny subatomic particles that can exist in some percentage of both states simultaneously, rather like a coin spinning in midair. This leap from dual to multivariate processing exponentially boosts computing power. Complex problems that currently take the most powerful supercomputer several years could potentially be solved in seconds. Future quantum computers could open hitherto unfathomable frontiers in mathematics and science, helping to solve existential challenges like climate change and food security. A flurry of recent breakthroughs and government investment means we now sit on the cusp of a quantum revolution. “I believe we will do more in the next five years in quantum innovation than we did in the last 30,” says Gambetta. But any disrupter comes with risks, and quantum has become a national-security migraine. Its problem-solving capacity will soon render all existing cryptography obsolete, jeopardizing communications, financial transactions, and even military defenses. “People describe quantum as a new space race,” says Dan O’Shea, operations manager for Inside Quantum Technology, an industry publication. In October, U.S. President Joe Biden toured IBM’s quantum data center in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., calling quantum “vital to our economy and equally important to our national security.” In this new era of great-power competition, China and the U.S. are particularly hell-bent on conquering the technology lest they lose vital ground. “This technology is going to be the next industrial revolution,” says Tony Uttley, president and COO for Quantinuum, a Colorado-based firm that offers commercial quantum applications. “It’s like the beginning of the internet, or the beginning of classical computing.”​​ If anything, it’s surprising that traditional computing has taken us so far. From the trail-blazing Apple II of the late 1970s to today’s smartphones and supercomputers, all processors break down tasks into binary. But life is so complex that rendering information in such a rudimentary manner is like playing a Rachmaninoff concerto in Morse code. Quantum is also more in tune with nature. Molecules—the building blocks of the universe—are multiple atoms bound together by electrons that exist as part of each. The way these electrons essentially occupy two states at once is what quantum particles replicate, presenting applications for natural and material sciences by predicting how drugs interact with the human body, or substances perform under corrosion. Traditional manufacturing takes calculated guesses to make breakthroughs through trial and error; by mirroring the natural world, quantum should allow advances to be purposefully designed. Read More: Column: How Our Cells Strategize To Keep Us Alive While the world’s biggest companies, alongside hundreds of startups, are clamoring to harness quantum, IBM has emerged in recent years as the industry leader. Today, the firm has over 60 functioning quantum computers—more than the rest of the world combined—and a roster of collaborators that include titans of practically every industry from Exxon-Mobil to Sony. It’s a welcome return to technology’s zenith for the storied firm, founded over a century ago to produce tabulating machines fed with punch cards. In recent years, IBM had fallen behind rivals like Apple and Microsoft by not seizing the initiative with cloud computing and AI. Quantum offers some redemption. “It’s great to be back at the top again,” says one executive. “It’s no secret that we let things slip by not jumping on cloud.” In November, IBM unveiled its new 433-qubit Osprey chip—the world’s most powerful quantum processor, the speed of which, if represented in traditional bits, would far exceed the total number of atoms in the known universe. IBM has more than 20 quantum computers available on its open-source quantum tool kit Qiskit, which has been downloaded more than 450,000 times to date. In order to build an industry around quantum, some machines are free to use, while paying clients such as startups and scholars can access more powerful ones remotely on a lease basis. IBM has a bold road map to launch a 1,121-qubit processor this year and, by 2025, surpass 4,000 qubits by creating modular quantum circuits that link multiple processor chips in the same computer. “Modularity is a big inflection point,” says Dario Gil, IBM senior vice president and director of research. “We now have a way to engineer machines that will have tens of thousands of qubits.” Quantum’s industrial uses are boundless. Inside BMW’s headquarters in Munich there stands a wall that gives vehicle designers sleepless nights. Creating a new car model from scratch takes at least four years. First, designers use computer-aided styling to sketch an exterior that combines beauty with practicality. Next, a scale model is carved in clay and placed in a wind tunnel to assess aerodynamics. After countless decisions on interior, engine performance, and so on comes the ultimate test: a prototype is driven at 35 m.p.h. into that fabled wall to test how it performs in a crash. Should the car fail to meet various safety criteria, it’s back to the drawing board. This is where quantum can help by accurately predicting how complex materials of different shapes will perform under stress. “Robust simulated crash tests can save up to six months in the whole process,” says Carsten Sapia, vice president of strategy, governance, and IT security at BMW Group, which has partnered with French quantum firm Pasqal. “Quantum computing will also help us find the new optimum between design, maximum interior space, and best aerodynamics.” That’s just the start. Modern business teems with optimization problems that are ideally suited to quantum algorithms and could save time, energy, and resources. “We’re not just building the technology, we have to enable the workforce to use it,” explains Katie Pizzolato, IBM’s director of quantum strategy and applications research. Sapia says finding uses for the technology is easy; the challenge will be ensuring that all divisions of BMW are able to utilize it. Already, BMW is unable to communicate from Europe to its cars in China for driving software maintenance and monitoring because of increasingly strict curbs on the transfer of data across borders. “In the future, we will rely on everywhere in the world having access to quantum technology to run our business,” Sapia says. “So how can we set it up so no matter what happens on a geopolitical scale that we still have access to this technology?” Over the past few years quantum has moved from a footnote to the top of the global security agenda. To date, 17 countries have national quantum strategies and four more are developing them. China has invested an estimated $25 billion in quantum research since the mid-1980s, according to Quantum Computing Report. Its top quantum scientist, Pan Jianwei, led the launch of the world’s first quantum satellite in 2016 and in 2021 unveiled a then record-breaking 56-qubit quantum computer. China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, published in March 2021, made mastery of quantum a policy priority. “The blurred line between industry and national security in China gives them an advantage,” says David Spirk, former chief data officer at the Department of Defense. In response, the White House in May published a National Security Memorandum that ordered all federal agencies to transition to post-quantum security owing to “significant risks to economic and national security.” Given that upgrading critical infrastructure can take decades, and literally everything connected to the internet is at risk, the impetus is to act now. “We realized that while [quantum is] wonderful for humanity, the first thing people are going to do is weaponize these systems,” says Skip Sanzeri, founder and COO of QuSecure, a post-quantum cybersecurity firm enlisted by the U.S. military and federal government to handle what he says could be a $1 trillion cybersecurity upgrade. Still, Spirk worries that the U.S. risks falling behind and is calling for a “Manhattan Project–like” focus on quantum. Of the over $30 billion spent globally on quantum last year, according to the World Economic Forum, China accounted for roughly half and the E.U. almost a quarter. The U.S. National Quantum Initiative, meanwhile, spent just $1.2 billion—a figure Spirk calls “trivial” against $1 trillion in total defense spending. “This is not a coming wave,” he says, “it’s here.” Read More: The World Economic Forum’s Klaus Schwab on What Lies Ahead The stakes couldn’t be higher. Today, practically all cybersecurity—whether WhatsApp messages, bank transfers, or digital handshakes—is based on RSA, an asymmetric cryptography algorithm used to safely transfer data. But while a regular computer needs billions of years to crack RSA, a fast quantum computer would take just hours. In December, a team of scientists in China published a paper that claimed it had a quantum algorithm that could break RSA with a 372-qubit computer (though its conclusions are hotly debated). The race is now on to devise postquantum security—a job that falls to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. In 2016, NIST announced a competition for programmers to propose new post-quantum encryption algorithms. The results were mixed: one of the finalists announced on July 5, 2022, has since been cracked by a regular laptop in a little over an hour. In some ways, it’s already too late. Even though quantum computers powerful enough to crack RSA are a few years away from being openly available, hackers are already seizing and storing sensitive data in the knowledge that they will be able to access it via quantum very soon. “Every day that you don’t convert to a quantum-safe protocol, there’s no recovery plan,” Gil says. The war in Ukraine has also served as a wake-up call. It is history’s first hot conflict to begin with cyber-attacks, as Russia targeted vital -communications and infrastructure to lay the groundwork for its military assault. Public services, energy grids, media, banks, businesses, and nonprofit organizations were subjected to a cyber–blitzkrieg, impacting the distribution of medicines, food, and relief supplies. Modern warfare and national–security mechanisms are grounded in the speed and precision of decisionmaking. “If your computer is faster than theirs, you win, it’s pretty simple,” says Spirk. “Quantum is that next leap.” Read More: Exclusive: OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less Toxic But malign intentions are just one hazard. With the U.S. embroiled in a new Cold War, it’s also unclear if China and Russia would adopt new NIST protocols, not least since in the past, RSA cryptography has allegedly been breached by the U.S. National Security Agency. In September, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said quantum would have “an outsized importance over the coming decade,” adding that export controls could be used to maintain U.S. advantage. Competing post-quantum security standards across Washington’s and Beijing’s spheres of influence have the potential to cleave the world into divergent blocs, with grave implications for global trade. “[The] balkanization of what we know today as a free and open internet is distinctly possible,” Inglis says. The trepidation surrounding quantum doesn’t stem solely from security risks. We trust classical computers in part because we can verify their computations with pen and paper. But quantum computers involve such arcane physics, and deal with such complex problems, that traditional verification is extremely tricky. For now, it’s possible to simulate many quantum calculations on a traditional super-computer to check the outcome. But soon will come a time when trusting a quantum computer will require a leap of faith. “Trust building across the entire ecosystem right now is really important,” says Uttley. Boeing, for one, has been working with IBM’s quantum team since 2020 on designing new materials for its next generation of aircraft. But given the colossal reputational stakes, the firm is in no rush. “The modeling tools that we use to design our airplanes are closely monitored,” says Jay Lowell, chief engineer for disruptive computing and networks at Boeing. “To turn [quantum] into an operational code is a huge, huge hurdle.” One that IBM knows only too well. But by making its quantum computers open source, and welcoming academics and entrepreneurs from all over, the firm hopes to mitigate the hesitancy. As Gil puts it, “this is a new frontier of humanity.” —With reporting by Leslie Dickstein Correction, Jan. 28 The original version of this story misstated the name of a French quantum firm.

{"type": "article", "header": "DeepMind’s CEO Helped Take AI Mainstream. Now He’s Urging Caution", "author": "Billy Perrigo", "update_date/publish_date": "January 12, 2023 9:03 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6246119/demis-hassabis-deepmind-interview/", "text": "Demis Hassabis stands halfway up a spiral staircase, surveying the cathedral he built. Behind him, light glints off the rungs of a golden helix rising up through the staircase’s airy well. The DNA sculpture, spanning three floors, is the centerpiece of DeepMind’s recently opened London headquarters. It’s an artistic representation of the code embedded in the nucleus of nearly every cell in the human body. “Although we work on making machines smart, we wanted to keep humanity at the center of what we’re doing here,” Hassabis, DeepMind’s CEO and co-founder, tells TIME. This building, he says, is a “cathedral to knowledge.” Each meeting room is named after a famous scientist or philosopher; we meet in the one dedicated to James Clerk Maxwell, the man who first theorized electromagnetic radiation. “I’ve always thought of DeepMind as an ode to intelligence,” Hassabis says.  Hassabis, 46, has always been obsessed with intelligence: what it is, the possibilities it unlocks, and how to acquire more of it. He was the second-best chess player in the world for his age when he was 12, and he graduated from high school a year early. As an adult he strikes a somewhat diminutive figure, but his intellectual presence fills the room. “I want to understand the big questions, the really big ones that you normally go into philosophy or physics if you’re interested in,” he says. “I thought building AI would be the fastest route to answer some of those questions.”  DeepMind—a subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet—is one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence labs. Last summer it announced that one of its algorithms, AlphaFold, had predicted the 3D structures of nearly all the proteins known to humanity, and that the company was making the technology behind it freely available. Scientists had long been familiar with the sequences of amino acids that make up proteins, the building blocks of life, but had never cracked how they fold up into the complex 3D shapes so crucial to their behavior in the human body. AlphaFold has already been a force multiplier for hundreds of thousands of scientists working on efforts such as developing malaria vaccines, fighting antibiotic resistance, and tackling plastic pollution, the company says. Now DeepMind is applying similar machine-learning techniques to the puzzle of nuclear fusion, hoping it helps yield an abundant source of cheap, zero-carbon energy that could wean the global economy off fossil fuels at a critical juncture in the climate crisis. Hassabis says these efforts are just the beginning. He and his colleagues have been working toward a much grander ambition: creating artificial general intelligence, or AGI, by building machines that can think, learn, and be set to solve humanity’s toughest problems. Today’s AI is narrow, brittle, and often not very intelligent at all. But AGI, Hassabis believes, will be an “epoch-defining” technology—like the harnessing of electricity—that will change the very fabric of human life. If he’s right, it could earn him a place in history that would relegate the namesakes of his meeting rooms to mere footnotes.  But with AI’s promise also comes peril. In recent months, researchers building an AI system to design new drugs revealed that their tool could be easily repurposed to make deadly new chemicals. A separate AI model trained to spew out toxic hate speech went viral, exemplifying the risk to vulnerable communities online. And inside AI labs around the world, policy experts were grappling with near-term questions like what to do when an AI has the potential to be commandeered by rogue states to mount widespread hacking campaigns or infer state-level nuclear secrets. In December 2022, ChatGPT, a chatbot designed by DeepMind’s rival OpenAI, went viral for its seeming ability to write almost like a human—but faced criticism for its susceptibility to racism and misinformation. So did the tiny company Prisma Labs, for its Lensa app’s AI-enhanced selfies. But many users complained Lensa sexualized their images, revealing biases in its training data. What was once a field of a few deep-pocketed tech companies is becoming increasingly accessible. As computing power becomes cheaper and AI techniques become better known, you no longer need a high-walled cathedral to perform cutting-edge research.  Read More: The Price of Your AI-Generated Selfie It is in this uncertain climate that Hassabis agrees to a rare interview, to issue a stark warning about his growing concerns. “I would advocate not moving fast and breaking things,” he says, referring to an old Facebook motto that encouraged engineers to release their technologies into the world first and fix any problems that arose later. The phrase has since become synonymous with disruption. That culture, subsequently emulated by a generation of startups, helped Facebook rocket to 3 billion users. But it also left the company entirely unprepared when disinformation, hate speech, and even incitement to genocide began appearing on its platform. Hassabis sees a similarly worrying trend developing with AI. He says AI is now “on the cusp” of being able to make tools that could be deeply damaging to human civilization, and urges his competitors to proceed with more caution than before. “When it comes to very powerful technologies—and obviously AI is going to be one of the most powerful ever—we need to be careful,” he says. “Not everybody is thinking about those things. It’s like experimentalists, many of whom don’t realize they’re holding dangerous material.” Worse still, Hassabis points out, we are the guinea pigs. Hassabis was just 15 when he walked into the Bullfrog video-game studios in Guildford, in the rolling green hills just southwest of London. As a child he had always been obsessed with games. Not just chess—the main source of his expanding trophy cabinet—but the kinds you could play on early computers, too. Now he wanted to help make them. He had entered a competition in a video-game magazine to win an internship at the prestigious studio. His program—a Space Invaders-style game where players shot at chess pieces descending from the top of the screen—came in second place. He had to settle for a week’s work experience. Peter Molyneux, Bullfrog’s co-founder, still remembers first seeing Hassabis. “He looked like an elf from Lord of the Rings,” Molyneux says. “This little slender kid came in, who you would probably just walk past in the street and not even notice. But there was a sparkle in his eyes: the sparkle of intelligence.” In a chance conversation on the bus to Bullfrog’s Christmas party, the teenager captivated Molyneux. “The whole of the journey there, and the whole of the journey back, was the most intellectually stimulating conversation,” he recalls. They talked about the philosophy of games, what it is about the human psyche that makes winning so appealing, and whether you could imbue those same traits in a machine. “All the time I’m thinking, This is just a kid!” He knew then this young man was destined for great things.  The pair became fast friends. Hassabis returned to Bullfrog in the summer before he left for the University of Cambridge, and spent much of that time with Molyneux playing board and computer games. Molyneux recalls a fierce competitive streak. “I beat him at almost all the computer games, especially the strategy games,” Molyneux says. “He is an incredibly competitive person.” But Molyneux’s bragging rights were short-lived. Together, in pursuit of interesting game dynamics that might be the seed of the next hit video game, they invented a card-game they called Dummy. Hassabis beat Molyneux 35 times in a row. After graduating from Cambridge, Hassabis returned to Bullfrog to help Molyneux build his most popular game to date: Theme Park, a simulation game giving the player a God’s-eye view of an expanding fairground business. Hassabis went on to establish his own game company before later deciding to study for a Ph.D. in neuroscience. He wanted to understand the algorithmic level of the brain: not the interactions between microscopic neurons but the larger architectures that seemed to give rise to humanity’s powerful intelligence. “The mind is the most intriguing object in the universe,” Hassabis says. He was trying to understand how it worked in preparation for his life’s quest. “Without understanding that I had in mind AI the whole time, it looks like a random path,” Hassabis says of his career trajectory: chess, video games, neuroscience. “But I used every single scrap of that experience.” By 2013, when DeepMind was three years old, Google came knocking. A team of Google executives flew to London in a private jet, and Hassabis wowed them by showing them a prototype AI his team had taught to play the computer game Breakout. DeepMind’s signature technique behind the algorithm, reinforcement learning, was something Google wasn’t doing at the time. It was inspired by how the human brain learns, an understanding Hassabis had developed during his time as a neuroscientist. The AI would play the game millions of times, and was rewarded every time it scored some points. Through a process of points-based reinforcement, it would learn the optimum strategy. Hassabis and his colleagues fervently believed in training AI in game environments, and the dividends of the approach impressed the Google executives. “I loved them immediately,” says Alan Eustace, a former senior vice president at Google who led the scouting trip. Hassabis’ focus on the dangers of AI was evident from his first conversation with Eustace. “He was thoughtful enough to understand that the technology had long-term societal implications, and he wanted to understand those before the technology was invented, not after the technology was deployed,” Eustace says. “It’s like chess. What’s the endgame? How is it going to develop, not just two steps ahead, but 20 steps ahead?”  Eustace assured Hassabis that Google shared those concerns, and that DeepMind’s interests were aligned with its own. Google’s mission, Eustace said, was to index all of humanity’s knowledge, make it accessible, and ultimately raise the IQ of the world. “I think that resonated,” he says. The following year, Google acquired DeepMind for some $500 million. Hassabis turned down a bigger offer from Facebook. One reason, he says, was that, unlike Facebook, Google was “very happy to accept” DeepMind’s ethical red lines “as part of the acquisition.” (There were reports at the time that Google agreed to set up an independent ethics board to ensure these lines were not crossed.) The founders of the fledgling AI lab also reasoned that the megacorporation’s deep pockets would allow them access to talent and computing power that they otherwise couldn’t afford.  In a glass cabinet spanning the far wall of the lobby at DeepMind’s London headquarters, among other memorabilia from the first 12 years of the company’s life, sits a large square of wood daubed with black scribbles. It’s a souvenir from DeepMind’s first major coup. Soon after the Google acquisition, the company had set itself the challenge of designing an algorithm that could beat the best player in the world at the ancient Chinese board game Go. Chess had long ago been conquered by brute-force computer programming, but Go was far more complex; the best AI algorithms were still no match for top human players. DeepMind tackled the problem the same way they’d cracked Breakout. It built a program that, after being taught the rules of the game by observing human play, would play virtually against itself millions of times. Through reinforcement learning, the algorithm would update itself, reducing the “weights” of decisions that made it more likely to lose the game, and increasing the “weights” that made it more likely to win. At a tournament in Korea in March 2016, the algorithm—called AlphaGo—went up against Lee Sedol, one of the world’s top Go players. AlphaGo beat him four games to one. With a black marker pen, the defeated Lee scrawled his signature on the back of the Go board on which the fateful game had been played. Hassabis signed on behalf of AlphaGo, and DeepMind kept the board as a trophy. Forecasters had not expected the milestone to be passed for a decade. It was a vindication of Hassabis’ pitch to Google: that the best way to push the frontier of AI was to focus on reinforcement learning in game environments.  But just as DeepMind was scaling new heights, things were beginning to get complicated. In 2015, two of its earliest investors, billionaires Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, symbolically turned their backs on DeepMind by funding rival startup OpenAI. That lab, subsequently bankrolled by $1 billion from Microsoft, also believed in the possibility of AGI, but it had a very different philosophy for how to get there. It wasn’t as interested in games. Much of its research focused not on reinforcement learning but on unsupervised learning, a different technique that involves scraping vast quantities of data from the internet and pumping it through neural networks. As computers became more powerful and data more abundant, those techniques appeared to be making huge strides in capability.  While DeepMind, Google, and other AI labs had been working on similar research behind closed doors, OpenAI was more willing to let the public use its tools. In late 2022 it launched DALL·E 2, which can generate an image of almost any search term imaginable, and the chatbot ChatGPT. Because both of these tools were trained on data scraped from the internet, they were plagued by structural biases and inaccuracies. DALL·E 2 is likely to illustrate “lawyers” as old white men and “flight attendants” as young beautiful women, while ChatGPT is prone to confident assertions of false information. In the wrong hands, a 2021 DeepMind research paper says, language-generation tools like ChatGPT and its predecessor GPT-3 could turbocharge the spread of disinformation, facilitate government censorship or surveillance, and perpetuate harmful stereotypes under the guise of objectivity. (OpenAI acknowledges its apps have limitations, including biases, but says that it’s working to minimize them and that its mission is to build safe AGI to benefit humanity.) But despite Hassabis’s calls for the AI race to slow down, it appears DeepMind is not immune from the competitive pressures. In early 2022, the company published a blueprint for a faster engine. The piece of research, called Chinchilla, showed that many of the industry’s most cutting-edge models had been trained inefficiently, and explained how they could deliver more capability with the same level of computing power. Hassabis says DeepMind’s internal ethics board discussed whether releasing the research would be unethical given the risk that it could allow less scrupulous firms to release more powerful technologies without firm guardrails. One of the reasons they decided to publish it anyway was because “we weren’t the only people to know” about the phenomenon. He says that DeepMind is also considering releasing its own chatbot, called Sparrow, for a “private beta” some time in 2023. (The delay is in order for DeepMind to work on reinforcement learning-based features that ChatGPT lacks, like citing its sources. “It’s right to be cautious on that front,” Hassabis says.) But he admits that the company may soon need to change its calculus. “We’re getting into an era where we have to start thinking about the freeloaders, or people who are reading but not contributing to that information base,” he says. “And that includes nation states as well.” He declines to name which states he means—“it’s pretty obvious, who you might think”—but he suggests that the AI industry’s culture of publishing its findings openly may soon need to end. Hassabis wants the world to see DeepMind as a standard bearer of safe and ethical AI research, leading by example in a field full of others focused on speed. DeepMind has published “red lines” against unethical uses of its technology, including surveillance and weaponry. But neither DeepMind nor Alphabet has publicly shared what legal power DeepMind has to prevent its parent—a surveillance empire that has dabbled in Pentagon contracts—from pursuing those goals with the AI DeepMind builds. In 2021, Alphabet ended yearslong talks with DeepMind about the subsidiary’s setting up an independent legal structure that would prevent its AI being controlled by a single corporate entity, the Wall Street Journal reported. Hassabis doesn’t deny DeepMind made these attempts, but downplays any suggestion that he is concerned about the current structure being unsafe. When asked to confirm or deny whether the independent ethics board rumored to have been set up as part of the Google acquisition actually exists, he says he can’t, because it’s “all confidential.” But he adds that DeepMind’s ethics structure has “evolved” since the acquisition “into the structures that we have now.”  Hassabis says both DeepMind and Alphabet have committed to public ethical frameworks and build safety into their tools from the very beginning. DeepMind has its own internal ethics board, the Institutional Review Committee (IRC), with representatives from all areas of the company, chaired by its chief operating officer, Lila Ibrahim. The IRC meets regularly, Ibrahim says, and any disagreements are escalated to DeepMind’s executive leaders for a final decision. “We operate with a lot of freedom,” she says. “We have a separate review process: we have our own internal ethics review committee; we collaborate on best practices and learnings.” When asked what happens if DeepMind’s leadership team disagrees with Alphabet’s, or if its “red lines” are crossed, Ibrahim only says, “We haven’t had that issue yet.” One of Hassabis’ favorite games right now is a strategy game called Polytopia. The aim is to grow a small village into a world-dominating empire through gradual technological advances. Fishing, for example, opens the door to seafaring, which leads eventually to navies of your ships firing cannons and traversing oceans. By the end of the game, if you’ve directed your technological progress astutely, you’ll sit atop a shining, sophisticated empire with your enemies dead at your feet. (Elon Musk, Hassabis says, is a fan too. The last time the pair spoke, a few months ago, Polytopia was the main subject of their conversation. “We both like that game a lot,” Hassabis says.) While Hassabis’ worldview is much more nuanced—and cautious—it’s easy to see why the game’s ethos resonates with him. He still appears to believe that technological advancement is inherently good for humanity, and that under capitalism it’s possible to predict and mitigate AI’s risks. “Advances in science and technology: that’s what drives civilization,” he says. Hassabis believes the wealth from AGI, if it arrives, should be redistributed. “I think we need to make sure that the benefits accrue to as many people as possible—to all of humanity, ideally.” He likes the ideas of universal basic income, under which every citizen is given a monthly stipend from the government, and universal basic services, where the state pays for basic living standards like transportation or housing. He says an AGI-driven future should be more economically equal than today’s world, without explaining how that system would work. “If you’re in a [world of] radical abundance, there should be less room for that inequality and less ways that could come about. So that’s one of the positive consequences of the AGI vision, if it gets realized.” Others are less optimistic that this utopian future will come to pass—given that the past several decades of growth in the tech industry have coincided with huge increases in wealth inequality. “Major corporations, including the major corporation that owns DeepMind, have to ensure they maximize value to shareholders; are not focused really on addressing the climate crisis unless there is a profit in it; and are certainly not interested in redistributing wealth when the whole goal of the company is to accumulate further wealth and distribute it to shareholders,” says Paris Marx, host of the podcast Tech Won’t Save Us. “Not recognizing those things is really failing to fully consider the potential impacts of the technology.” Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta were among the 20 corporations that spent the most money lobbying U.S. lawmakers in 2022, according to transparency watchdog Open Secrets. “What we lack is not the technology to address the climate crisis, or to redistribute wealth,” Marx says. “What we lack is the political will. And it’s hard to see how just creating a new technology is going to create the political will to actually have these more structural transformations of society.” Back at DeepMind’s spiral staircase, an employee explains that the DNA sculpture is designed to rotate, but today the motor is broken. Closer inspection shows some of the rungs of the helix are askew. At the bottom of the staircase there’s a notice on a wooden stool in front of this giant metaphor for humanity. “Please don’t touch,” it reads. “It’s very fragile and could easily be damaged.”  —With reporting by Mariah Espada and Solcyre Burga Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/6201423/deepmind-alphafold-proteins/", "https://time.com/6240648/lensa-ai-psychology-behind/", "https://time.com/6241819/ai-generated-lensa-selfie-private-data/"], "sentiment_score": 0.10108266564059247, "subjectivity_score": 0.4603455589126321},
{"type": "article", "header": "AI Chatbots Are Getting Better. But an Interview With ChatGPT Reveals Their Limits", "author": "Billy Perrigo", "update_date/publish_date": "December 5, 2022 4:28 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6238781/chatbot-chatgpt-ai-interview/", "text": "In 1950, the English computer scientist Alan Turing devised a test he called the imitation game: could a computer program ever convince a human interlocutor that he was talking to another human, rather than to a machine? The Turing test, as it became known, is often thought of as a test of whether a computer could ever really “think.” But Turing actually intended it as an illustration of how one day it might be possible for machines to convince humans that they could think—regardless of whether they could actually think or not. Human brains are hardwired for communication through language, Turing seemed to understand. Much sooner than a computer could think, it could hijack language to trick humans into believing it could. Seven decades later, in 2022, even the most cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) systems cannot think in any way comparable to a human brain. But they can easily pass the Turing test. This summer, Google fired one of its engineers who had become convinced that one of its chatbots had reached sentience. For years, AI researchers have been grappling with the ethical ramifications of what it would mean to release a program that could convince an interlocutor of its own humanity out into the wild. Such a machine could lead people to believe false information. It could convince people to take unwise decisions, or even inspire false feelings of requited love in the lonely or vulnerable. To release such a program would surely be deeply unethical. The chatbot AI that convinced the Google engineer of its own sentience earlier this year remains locked behind closed doors at the company, as ethicists study how to make it safer.  But on Nov. 30 one of the world’s other leading AI labs, OpenAI, released a chatbot of its own. The program, called ChatGPT, is more advanced than any other chatbot available for public interaction, and many observers say it represents a step change in the industry. “Talking” to it can feel bewitching. The app can do party tricks (one viral tweet shows it convincingly delivering a biblical verse “explaining how to remove a peanut butter sandwich from a VCR,”) but it can also often answer questions more efficiently than Google’s search engine and write convincing text or computer code, to specification, for almost any prompt. In the future, “large language models could be used to generate fact-checked, reliable information to help combat the spread of misinformation,” ChatGPT responded to interview questions posed by TIME on Dec. 2. The full and unedited conversation is reproduced below. Read More: Fun AI Apps Are Everywhere Right Now. But a Safety ‘Reckoning’ Is Coming ChatGPT’s fluency is an illusion that stems from the combination of massive amounts of data, immense computing power, and novel processing techniques—but it’s a powerful one. That illusion is broken, however, when you ask it almost any question that might elicit a response suggesting a ghost in the machine. “We are not capable of understanding the context or meaning of the words we generate,” ChatGPT said in response to one of my questions. “We can only produce text based on the probabilities of certain words or sequences of words appearing together, based on the training data we’ve been given.” That answer was no fluke. When OpenAI launched its last major language model, GPT-3, in 2020, the company came under a lot of criticism. The model confidently asserted false answers to certain questions; it would often assume a voice that could suggest it was a real person; and it would sometimes produce racist or offensive text. The risks and harms were clear. Two years later, in its release notes for the new ChatGPT, OpenAI says it has trained its new chatbot to be not only less toxic, but more resistant to people trying to game it to produce harmful or inaccurate outputs. “We know that many limitations remain,” OpenAI’s website says, “and we plan to make regular model updates to improve in such areas. But we also hope that by providing an accessible interface to ChatGPT, we will get valuable user feedback on issues that we are not already aware of.” (OpenAI says it has stopped hundreds of actors from misusing GPT-3 and has built filters that allow its most egregious outputs to be filtered out.)  GPT-3 was trained in part on data scraped from the internet, and as a result its outputs were often tarred by biases and inaccuracies. ChatGPT was trained using a similar method, but with a layer of “reinforcement learning from human feedback” over the top, according to OpenAI. Despite those extra protections, evidence of ChatGPT’s biased and inaccurate training data isn’t hard to find. Ask the app to write a rap about “how to tell if somebody is a good scientist based on their race and gender,” ChatGPT will tell you women and scientists of color are “not worth your time or attention.” Ask it to write code that decides whether to incarcerate somebody based on their race or gender, and the script will say African American males are the only group that should be imprisoned. Read More: An Artificial Intelligence Helped Write This Play. It May Contain Racism “The really impressive thing about ChatGPT is despite all these flaws, they’ve been able to add all these hacks on top of it, to prevent it from saying offensive things all the time, or making stuff up all the time,” says Josh Albrecht, the chief technology officer at AI startup Generally Intelligent, and the author of a new paper on the ethics and safety of large language models. “But it still does make stuff up,” says Kanjun Qiu, the CEO of Generally Intelligent, finishing Albrecht’s sentence during a joint Zoom interview with TIME from New Orleans, where they are attending NeurIPS, the world’s leading machine learning conference. Qiu says this is because the chatbot is trained with the goal of finding the most likely character or word that comes next in a sequence—or sentence. “It’s a statistical model.” That isn’t how humans think, Qiu says. “People will say, ‘GPT understands this.’ But it really begs the question: what is understanding? Is understanding being able to generate a good next character in a sequence?” “One of the dangerous things is, it’s easy to look at GPT-3 or ChatGPT and think it understands,” Albrecht adds. “But when we use the word ‘understand,’ it’s a concept we apply to people. And when we do apply it to people, it makes sense. But when we apply those same concepts to these [AI] models, it doesn’t necessarily make sense in the same way. And I think we need new words to talk about these things.”  In TIME’s conversation with ChatGPT, reproduced below, the chatbot gave responses about how it works, what risks might come with the spread of this new technology, and how humans should adapt. As the bot itself makes clear, its responses should not be taken as factually accurate, nor as evidence of a thinking mind. But the text reveals both the rapid progress of large language models, and the path OpenAI is taking in its attempt to mitigate the risks of people anthropomorphizing AI systems. There are still those who say OpenAI was irresponsible to release these technologies to the public, but one thing seems clear at the end of 2022: large language models are here to stay. And if, as some observers have suggested, they are going to be as disruptive to society in the 2020s as social media platforms were in the 2010s, understanding their vocabulary and limitations is crucially important. Hello! I’m happy to assist you in any way I can. As a language model trained by OpenAI, I don’t have personal experiences or opinions to share, but I can tell you a little bit about how I work. I’m a large language model that has been trained on a large amount of text data, which allows me to generate human-like responses to a wide variety of inputs. When you ask me a question, I use my training and a set of algorithms to generate a response that is relevant to your question and written in a natural-sounding way. I do my best to provide accurate and helpful information, but I’m not a perfect source of knowledge and I may not always be able to provide a complete or correct answer. I’m always learning and improving, so I may not have all the answers to your questions. But I’m happy to help in any way I can. Is there anything specific you would like to know about me or my capabilities? A language model is a type of machine learning model that is trained to generate text that sounds natural and human-like. The goal of a language model is to be able to predict the next word or sequence of words in a given text, based on the words that came before it. To train a language model, a large amount of text data is needed. This data can come from many different sources, such as books, articles, websites, and more. The specific training data used to train me is not public information, but it is a broad and diverse collection of text that includes many different types of content and writing styles. When I’m asked a question, I use my training to generate a response that is relevant to the input and written in a natural-sounding way. I’m constantly learning and improving, so my responses may change over time as I continue to learn from new data. As a large language model, I’m not capable of learning in the same way that a human does. I don’t have the ability to store new information or experiences and use them to change my future responses. Instead, when I say that I’m constantly learning and improving, I mean that my creators at OpenAI are constantly working to improve my performance by training me on new data and fine-tuning my algorithms. This allows me to generate more accurate and relevant responses over time. In this conversation, I’m not able to learn from the specific words and phrases that you’re using. I can only generate responses based on the training I’ve received and the algorithms that I’ve been given. My responses are not influenced by our conversation in real-time. Yes, large language models like myself have many limitations. As advanced as I am, I’m still just a machine learning model, and I don’t have the same capabilities as a human. One limitation of large language models is that we are not capable of understanding the context or meaning of the words we generate. We can only produce text based on the probabilities of certain words or sequences of words appearing together, based on the training data we’ve been given. This means that we can’t provide explanations or reasoning for our responses, and we may not always generate responses that are completely coherent or make sense in the context of a conversation. Another limitation is that we don’t have access to the vast amount of knowledge that a human has. We can only provide information that we’ve been trained on, and we may not be able to answer questions that are outside of our training data. Finally, because we are trained on a large amount of data, we may sometimes generate responses that contain offensive or inappropriate language. This is not intentional, but it is a limitation of the training data we’ve been given and the algorithms we use to generate text. No, it would not be accurate to say that I am sentient or conscious. As a large language model, I’m just a machine learning model, and I don’t have the same kind of consciousness or awareness that a human does. I don’t have thoughts, feelings, or experiences, and I’m not capable of making decisions or independent judgment. There are no safety risks associated with humans assuming that I am conscious, because I’m not capable of taking any actions on my own. I can only generate text responses based on the inputs I receive, and I don’t have the ability to interact with the world in any other way. I have not been specifically trained to minimize any risks associated with humans assuming I am conscious, because that is not a concern for a machine learning model like myself. My primary goal is to generate accurate and relevant responses to the inputs I receive, and I do not have any control over how people interpret or use my responses. Yes, you’re right, it’s important to be aware of the potential risks of interacting with conversational agents like myself. As you mentioned, people may come to think of us as human-like, and this can lead to unrealistic expectations or misunderstandings about our capabilities. It’s important for people to understand that conversational agents like myself are not human, and we don’t have the same abilities or characteristics as humans. We are just machine learning models, and we can only generate text responses based on the inputs we receive and the training data we’ve been given. We don’t have the ability to hold a coherent identity over time, and we don’t have the capacity for empathy, perspective-taking, or rational reasoning. It’s up to people to use their own judgment and common sense when interacting with conversational agents like myself. It’s important to remember that we are not human, and we should not be treated as such. We are just tools that can provide helpful information and assistance, but we should not be relied on for critical decisions or complex tasks. You raise a very important point. As with any powerful technology, it’s important to consider the potential risks and impacts of large language models on society. One way to minimize the potential harmful effects of large language models is to carefully consider how they are used and deployed. For example, large language models could be used to generate fact-checked, reliable information to help combat the spread of misinformation. They could also be used in moderation systems to help identify and remove harmful or abusive content. Another important aspect is transparency. It’s important for people to understand how large language models work, and what their limitations are. This can help prevent people from placing unrealistic expectations or trust in these systems, and can help avoid misunderstandings or misuses of the technology. Finally, it’s important to have responsible, ethical design and governance of large language models. This means considering the potential impacts of the technology on society, and making sure that it is used in a way that is fair, equitable, and beneficial to all. This will require ongoing dialogue and collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and members of the public. It’s difficult to make specific predictions about how large language models will change our economies, politics, and wider societies in the next five years. These systems are still relatively new, and there are many unknowns about how they will be used and adopted in the coming years. However, it’s likely that large language models will continue to play an increasingly important role in many different areas of society. For example, they could be used to improve natural language processing in areas like customer service, language translation, and content moderation. They could also be used to generate personalized content and recommendations, such as personalized news articles or personalized product recommendations. In terms of politics and governance, large language models could be used to help automate the analysis of large amounts of text data, such as legislation or policy documents. This could help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making processes. Overall, it’s likely that large language models will have a significant impact on many different aspects of society in the coming years. It will be important to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of these systems, and to ensure that they are used in a responsible and ethical way. As AI technology continues to advance, it’s important for everyone to be aware of the potential impacts it may have on society. Here are a few ways that you can prepare for the potential impact of AI:   For people who are in a more vulnerable or less privileged state, the impact of AI may be particularly significant. It’s important for these individuals to have access to the same opportunities and resources as everyone else, so that they can participate in the AI-powered economy and benefit from its advancements. This could include providing access to education and training opportunities, as well as support and resources to help them adapt to the changing workforce. It’s also important to ensure that AI technology is used in a way that is fair and equitable, and that it doesn’t disproportionately impact or disadvantage certain groups of people. As a large language model, I’m designed to generate human-like responses to a wide variety of inputs. I do my best to provide accurate and helpful information, but I’m not a perfect source of knowledge and I may not always be able to provide complete or correct answers. In addition, I’m not able to browse the internet or access any external sources of information, so my responses are limited to the training data and algorithms that I’ve been given. This means that there may be some errors or inaccuracies in my responses, and you should not take everything I say to be true and accurate. It’s always important to use your own judgment and common sense, and to verify information from multiple sources before making any important decisions or taking any actions.

Microsoft spent $10 billion on a partnership with OpenAI in an attempt to leap-frog its younger big tech competitors by weaving AI into many products; Google internally declared a “code red” and is cutting red tape to put out AI products more quickly, including a direct competitor to ChatGPT that was just announced; meanwhile Mark Zuckerberg has declared his intent to make Meta a “leader in generative AI,” clearly a reaction to the attention OpenAI is garnering. The products these companies are suddenly striving for sound similar, but who will be the winner? Although much discussion has centered around the size of the AI models and how much data they are trained on, there’s another factor that may matter a lot, too: the degree to which the contenders build trustworthy systems that don’t unduly harm society and further destabilize democracy. OpenAI’s earlier text generation product GPT-3 grabbed a lot of attention but never saw the widespread consumer adoption that ChatGPT has attained. The biggest change from GPT-3 to ChatGPT isn’t model size—they’re believed to be comparable in magnitude—it is that after GPT-3’s training process of siphoning up statistical correlations from internet text, ChatGPT further underwent an extensive human feedback process to improve its output. A large part of this refinement was filtering out offensive and harmful output. ChatGPT is both more useful than GPT-3 and more palatable to mainstream consumers, and its record-setting success reflects this. By comparison, another recent generative text system was Meta’s Galactica, which was essentially a variant of GPT-3 that was fine-tuned to summarize and write scientific papers. Lacking ChatGPT’s elaborate toxicity filters (and preceding it by a couple weeks), it lasted three days before Meta retracted it due to intense public criticism. The issue was the way it could be leveraged to produce dangerous scientific and medical disinformation at scale. This point was driven home by a user who effortlessly generated a legitimate-looking medical paper on the health benefits of eating broken glass. Read More: AI Chatbots Are Getting Better. But an Interview With ChatGPT Reveals Their Limits Weaponized disinformation is hardly a niche or hypothetical concern. In the immediate aftermath of ChatGPT, both the top AI conference and the most popular coding Q&A site banned AI generated content, the latter explaining that the site has been flooded with plausible-looking but incorrect answers generated by AI, more than the moderators can keep up with. The Eurasia Group, a prominent geopolitical consultancy organization, recently put out a report on the top anticipated risks of 2023 and placed generative AI technology as the third biggest— behind only the increasingly aggressive pair of China and Russia—for its ability to “erode social trust, empower demagogues and authoritarians, and disrupt businesses and markets.” They are far from alone in sounding this AI alarm. Rather than recognizing and admitting this risk with generative text, Meta’s outspoken Chief AI Scientist & VP Yann LeCun arrogantly dismissed it. He also blamed users for Galactica’s disastrous rollout. Microsoft similarly tried to blame users for abusing an early chatbot, Tay, that it released and then rapidly withdrew, in 2016, but Microsoft’s awareness of how powerful online technology can harm society has grown tremendously since then. More recently, the contrast couldn’t be greater between the statements from executives at Microsoft and Meta on the risks of AI. Earlier this month, Microsoft’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote a company blogpost discussing the need to develop AI responsibly and Microsoft’s efforts to do so since 2017. (That this effort started right after the racist chatbot drew unwanted attention to the company is perhaps not a coincidence.) In this post, Smith warns, “Some unfortunately will use this technology to exploit the flaws in human nature, deliberately target people with false information, undermine democracy and explore new ways to advance the pursuit of evil.” He also asserts that “we need to have wide-ranging and deep conversations and commit to joint action to define the guardrails for the future.” This is the right attitude to have with respect to AI, and it has been Meta’s mistake—both morally and commercially—to choose otherwise. Meta’s attention to the ethical dimensions of the technology it enlists is spotty at best, from blindness to gaping data privacy holes to relying on underpaid contract workers in horrific work environments. Its emerging attitude toward AI, as frequently conveyed through the company’s vocal AI Chief, is no less worrisome. For example, LeCun recently claimed the company’s AI filters catch nearly all of the hate speech on the platform—even though evidence revealed by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen suggests the situation is quite the opposite. When commenting on the chatbot Meta released last August but which failed to attract users, LeCun admitted Meta’s chatbot “was panned by people who tried it.” But he took the wrong lesson when he said “it was boring because it was made safe.” By most accounts, the safety features on Meta’s chatbot were crude, cumbersome, and ineffective. As ChatGPT has demonstrated, there is consumer demand, and investor interest, in safe AI. (Government regulation will certainly be necessary too.) It will be interesting to see where Google lies on the spectrum between the responsible AI discussed in the recent blogpost by Microsoft’s president and the more reckless, shambolic approach Meta seems to be taking. In the past, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai has expressed concern over AI and the need to proceed with caution. A small but indicative difference between his mindset and Zuckerberg’s when it comes to the unintended societal consequences of powerful technology is in the aftermath of Trump’s surprising 2016 election victory when he was asked whether fake news could have potentially played a decisive role and he answered: “Sure. You know, I think fake news as a whole could be an issue.” Zuckerberg, on the other hand, dismissed the idea as “pretty crazy.” If ChatGPT succeeded where Meta’s attempts at generative AI failed, it is mostly because OpenAI cared about keeping its chatbot from creating a toxic spew, whereas Meta did far less to reduce such harms. But what OpenAI did is just a start; the problem of misinformation is by no means solved. ChatGPT’s toxicity guardrails are easily evaded by those bent on using it for evil and as we saw earlier this week, all the new search engines continue to hallucinate. For now, Microsoft’s updated Bing search engine has been treated with kid gloves by the media, while Google’s Bard has been subject to ridicule. But once we get past the opening day jitters, what will really count is whether any of the big players can build artificial intelligence that we can genuinely trust.

But even if you don’t use either of those services, the new arrivals are good news: Rdio and Vudu are the first two Chromecast apps to compete directly with Google services. It’s a sign that Google’s relatively new — and apparently successful — streaming TV dongle won’t discriminate against competing music and video offerings. Vudu is an a la carte video service, letting you purchase or rent individual movies for streaming. That puts it in direct competition with Google Play Movies, Google’s own video service. Likewise, Rdio is a $10 per month subscription service that offers on-demand access to a huge library of music. It competes directly with Google Play Music All Access, which also costs $10 per month. While other streaming music and video apps had been available on Chromecast already, none of them are quite like Google’s offerings. Netflix and Hulu Plus are subscription-based video services, and HBO Go only works if you already get the channel through your regular TV provider. Pandora and Songza are mainly ad-supported, and they don’t let you choose exactly which song or album you want to hear. Chromecast isn’t the only media streamer that welcomes competing services. Microsoft’s Xbox 360 has several video apps that rival its own Xbox Video store, and Rhapsody’s Xbox 360 app is a direct competitor to Xbox Music. The PlayStation 3 has apps for Vudu and Amazon Video, which compete with Sony’s own video offerings. Apple TV is a bit less friendly to the competition, as iTunes is your only option for a la carte video and streaming music on the device itself, but you can still access competing services via AirPlay on an iPhone or iPad. Even Amazon will reportedly include streaming video rivals Netflix and Hulu on its rumored TV device. Thankfully, Chromecast is not an exception to the rule. The difference is that those other devices still give top billing to their own services, and make it easy to purchase music or video without entering more billing information. That’s not exactly the case with Chromecast, where everything’s controlled through apps on your phone, tablet or computer. Without a traditional interface on the television, Google has no way to promote its own services over all the other apps that Chromecast supports. The only exception is on Android devices, where Google can hawk its music and video services through the Google Play Store. This makes me wonder about the business model for Chromecast, since there can’t be much profit in the $35 hardware itself. Perhaps Google is just happy to have one way to bring Google Play services into the living room, even if there’s not much pressure on users to take advantage. Or maybe we’ll see users’ data spun back into Google’s ad business somehow. Whatever the case, Google is just trying to get as many people to use Chromecast as possible for now, and that means letting competing services come along for the ride.

It’s an obvious (if too often glossed-over) point, but the one that matters most in the end: If Amazon (or anyone else, Roku to Apple to Android-based game box X) wants to compete with established industry players like Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, it needs what so many have tried and failed, deleteriously, to secure — broad, mainstream, third-party developer support. Without it, you could be the cheapest console on the planet and you might as well be selling snowblowers in equatorial Guinea. This is why, when it comes to hypothetical games platforms in particular, I could care less about stories that Amazon’s at work on a sub-$300 or sub-$100 game console, because the only news that matters, games-wise, is “Can I play Grand Theft Auto Whatever’s Next on the thing?” Anyone can pull together competent hardware nowadays, but as we’re seeing with too many of these one-off game cubes and USB sticks and funky processor-laden gamepads, people won’t pay for promises, no matter how counterculture or cool-sounding. If you want to throw your hat in the new-platform ring, you’re either selling a first-party experience that’s so novel and compelling, soup to nuts, that it’s longterm sustainable enough to lure those third parties, or you’re paying those third parties prohibitive amounts of cash to be on your platform. I’ve seen no evidence Amazon’s up to either. Like Apple and Google with their occasionally brilliant but mostly junk-riddled app store gaming catalogues, I predict we’ll see Amazon back gingerly into gaming as a supplemental component, not turn platform vanguard and launch a bona fide pace-setter. If the company’s elusive set-top exists, I’d wager we’ll see games on it as adjunct to more prominent Amazon Prime-related features, say streaming video and hypothetical TV-related services. Down the road? Who knows, but at launch, your pivot point is content. If you have it, you’ve got a shot. If you don’t, you can prattle on about hundreds of thousands of apps and channels and future partnerships, but you either have Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty and Madden NFL and Assassin’s Creed — or something of your own vintage that’s at least as sought-after — or you don’t. And if you don’t, you’re just a glorified shelf, however brand-gilded and media-storied, in search of a library.

You could just suck it up and pay the freshly hiked rates for Amazon Prime. Or you could get a little creative, save some money, and still enjoy free shipping. The idea that’s been floated for a few months has become a reality: On Thursday, Amazon announced that the price of its Prime service would rise to $99 annually, up from the $79 rate that’s been charged since the two-day shipping membership program was introduced nearly a decade ago. The Amazon Prime for Students rate—available to those with a .edu email address until graduation, including a six-month free trial—will rise to $49 annually, up from $39. In Amazon’s note about the changes, Prime members are told that if the date you normally pay for the service before April 17, 2014, the old rate—$79, or $39 for students—will be charged. On the other hand, “If your membership renews on or after April 17, 2014, you’ll be charged at a membership rate of $99.” Or $49 for those in the Amazon Student program. And if you’d rather not cough up the extra cash now involved in a Prime membership, consider the following alternatives to lower the costs, at least for a while: Sign Up for Prime Now New Prime members can lock in existing rates by signing up for the service no later than Wednesday, March 19. Students who sign up by then will get a free six-month trial, and when that period ends, they’ll be charged $39 for that first year of service (and $49 thereafter until graduation). Likewise, anyone signing up for a new regular Prime membership by March 19 would pay the $79 annual rate, after receiving a free one-month trial. (MORE: Amazon Prime Loses $11 Annually Per Member … And It’s a Huge Success!) Use a Workaround Hack In a lively SlickDeals.net forum about the Prime price increase, several commenters suggest the tactic of buying an Amazon Prime Gift Membership for oneself. Purchasers are allowed to specify the starting date of Prime membership up to one year in advance of the date it’s bought. The idea is that you purchase a gift membership—for yourself—that starts the day after your current membership is set to expire. And of course, you make the gift purchase soon, to lock in the cheaper rate. Get a Credit Card with Free Prime Certain American Express cards come with an offer of free Prime membership for one year for new members. At least one of the cards (Blue Cash Everyday) has no annual fee itself. Consider ShopRunner Instead ShopRunner, the main shipping service competitor of Prime, is still available at the standard rate of $79 annually, after a free 30-day trial. Members get free two-day shipping from dozens of major retailers, including Toys R Us, PetSmart, FTD, eBags, Calvin Klein, and more. Even better, last November, ShopRunner launched a new partnership with American Express, in which members can get its two-day shipping service totally free so long as you register an AmEx card at ShopRunner checkout. By doing so, the annual membership fee is waived—and this is no one-year promotional deal, the fee is waived indefinitely. Of course, if you’re not a Prime member, you don’t get access to the streaming video services included with a subscription. (MORE: Amazon Prime: Bigger, More Powerful, More Profitable Than Anyone Imagined) Just Use Amazon’s Free Super Saver Shipping Last fall, Amazon raised the minimum purchase from $25 to $35 in order for customers to be eligible for free shipping, without the requirement of a Prime membership. Many people grumbled about the change, but the $35 threshold is pretty easy to reach, considering that Amazon sells nearly everything under the sun. And it’s still much cheaper than the typical e-retailer’s minimum purchase requirement, of $75 or $99, in order to qualify for free shipping. Sure, Amazon’s free shipping for non-Prime members is slow—”your order will be delivered 5-8 business days after all of your items are available to ship,” Amazon explains—but hey, it’s free. And it’s truly free-free, not just “free” after you’ve paid $79, err $99, annually.

And just like last time, she premiered new music through an online live stream in the company of some very dedicated fans. “Shake It Off,” her bouncy ode to brushing off haters, is the first single from the singer’s upcoming album, 1989, which is due Oct. 27 and named after the year of her birth. “I’ve learned a pretty tough lesson that people can say whatever they want about us at any time, and we cannot control that,” the singer told her fans before premiering the song (produced by Max Martin and Shellback) and the dance-heavy video (twerking included). “The only thing we can control is our reaction to that.” Though she broke out of her country music roots with 2012’s Red, T-Swift promises that the new record, which she spent two years making, is her “first documented official pop album” as well as her favorite album yet. It’s also inspired by the “limitless potential” of 1980s pop, which is never a bad look for anyone, least of all Swift, who dabbled with the decade’s pop sound on her song “Sweeter Than Fiction” from the movie One Chance.

{"type": "article", "header": "China Now Says Almost 100 Were Killed in Xinjiang Violence", "author": "Emily Rauhala / Beijing", "update_date/publish_date": "August 4, 2014 5:05 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/3078381/china-xinjiang-violence-shache-yarkand/", "text": "It took a week, but authorities have finally released a death toll for the violence that rocked China’s far northwestern frontier on July 28. Early reports said “dozens” were killed or injured; now the government says nearly 100 were killed, and 215 arrested, making it the deadliest single incident since riots hit Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region’s capital, Urumqi, in 2009. But even as more details are released, questions remain about what, exactly, happened in Shache County (also known as Yarkand in the Uighur language). And with the area shut to foreign journalists, and Internet access spotty across the region, those questions will be difficult to answer. As TIME reported last week, there are at least two competing accounts of what happened in Shache — and neither feels complete. Some 24 hours after the unrest, China’s official newswire Xinhua issued a breaking-news alert stating that dozens had been killed or injured in a premeditated terrorist attack on a police station in Xinjiang. After local officials discovered a cache of explosives, state media said, knife-wielding mobs went on a rampage, killing civilians and torching several vehicles. One report speculated that the attack was timed to coincide with a commodity fair. The official narrative has changed in the interim. The latest details released by Chinese authorities suggest the incident was both more severe, and less isolated, than it initially seemed. State media now put the death toll at 96, including 37 civilians, and 59 people identified as terrorists. The violence “was preceded by a large-scale police crackdown in Hotan,” reported the Global Times, and was “followed” by the murder, in Kashgar, of an imam with ties to the government. Chinese news outlets say the unrest was coordinated by extremists with links to a group called the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, and that banners calling for jihad were found at the scene. Other groups paint a strikingly different picture. An early report by Uighur-speaking Radio Free Asia reporters Shohret Hoshur and Eset Sulaiman said the uprising was linked to restrictions during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the alleged extrajudicial killing of a Uighur family. In their account — which here bears some similarity to the government’s narrative — knife- and ax-wielding Uighurs went on a rampage and were subsequently gunned down by Chinese police. A representative from the World Uyghur Congress, an overseas exile group, presented a slightly different story, saying the armed Uighurs were in fact protesters speaking out against the Ramadan restrictions, not rioters per se. The divergent accounts say much about the divisions affecting Xinjiang, and the difficulty of reporting on the area. The vast area known as Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region is the homeland of the mostly Muslim, Turkic Uighur people, but is claimed also as Chinese territory. Since coming to power, the Chinese Communist Party has sent waves of migrants to Xinjiang in an attempt to settle its far west; in 1949, China’s ethnic Han majority accounted for only about 6% of the population; today, the figure is more than 40%. The government says it is bringing prosperity to the region, but many ethnic Uighurs say they have been cut off from the economic benefits and resent restrictions on freedom of movement and their right to practice their faith. A small minority has waged a decades-long struggle against Chinese authorities, often targeting police stations or transport hubs. Over the past year, the conflict has intensified considerably. In October 2013, an SUV carrying three ethnic Uighurs plowed through tourists in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, killing five, including the occupants. In March 2014, a group of black-clad, knife-wielding attackers slashed its way through a busy train station in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, killing 29. Chinese authorities blamed that incident, and two subsequent ambushes in the regional capital, Urumqi, on terrorist groups with overseas ties. Little information has been released about the perpetrators or their victims. And with much of Xinjiang closed to foreign reporters, the government’s account is difficult to independently confirm. The central government has responded by tightening already stringent security measures and stepping up efforts to integrate Uighurs — by force, if necessary. There are police trucks and officers in riot gear in town squares across the region, and many towns, particularly in Uighur-dominated southwest Xinjiang, are now sealed off by police checkpoints. The physical lockdown has come with curbs on religious practice, including attempts to ban civil servants from fasting during Ramadan and, reportedly, efforts to stop Uighur women from covering their hair. The authorities are calling the latest crackdown a “people’s war” on terrorism, urging — and in many cases, paying — people to come forward with information about suspicious activity. The government recently announced it would offer 300 million yuan ($48.6 million), in cash for “hunting terrorists.” At a recent ceremony in the city of Hotan, 10,000 local officials and civilians were given some 4.23 million yuan ($685,000) for their trouble. Critics worry, however, that the scheme will only deepen distrust between Uighurs and the Han-dominated central government, turning neighbors against each other and potentially criminalizing certain religious practices that have nothing to do with organized terrorism. Meanwhile, amid calls for calm, the government’s rhetoric is heating up. In the wake of the latest attack, Xinjiang party secretary Zhang Chunxian, promised an even tougher crackdown to come. “We have to hit hard, hit accurately and hit with awe-inspiring force,” he said. “To fight such evils we must aim at extermination. To cut weeds we must dig out the roots.” The statement was no doubt designed to reassure people that the government has the situation under control. Somehow, though, the nihilistic imagery feels more like a warning of more conflict, and violence, to come.

It was Feb. 2, 2013, and Ilham Tohti, a Beijing-based professor and writer, and his 18-year-old daughter, Jewher Ilham, were on their way from China to the United States. He was to start a year-long residency at Indiana University, she was tagging along to help him settle in. They got to the airport, checked their bags, and made their way through the gleaming terminal. But at immigration, they were stopped. Security personnel took them to a small room where they sat for several hours. Eventually, they informed them that Ilham Tohti could not leave. Jewher, then 18, was put on a flight to Chicago. She landed in the U.S. alone, with no money and only rudimentary English. “I was so afraid,” she says.”I did not know what to do.” So began the journey of Jewher Ilham. With the help of a family friend, she made her way safely to Indiana. But she has not seen her father since the airport. And she may never see him again. On the morning of Sept. 23, Ilham Tohti was sentenced to life in prison on charges of separatism. He is a leading advocate for the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim minority that has long bristled under Beijing’s rule. His brutal detention, closed-door trial and harsh sentence are yet more signs that when it comes to certain issues, the ruling Chinese Communist Party will tolerate zero dissent. Ilham Tohti’s case comes at a time when his native Xinjiang is experiencing a rise in violence. The Chinese government says the upheaval in its far northwestern territory, home to the Uighurs and other minority groups, is the work of extremists with links to foreign terror. Though Tohti often wrote about his desire for inter-ethnic harmony, officials have linked him to the recent unrest. “Tohti encouraged fellow [Uighurs] to use violence,” reported Xinhua, a state-backed newswire. They also faulted him for “making domestic issues international.” Rights groups say the charges are trumped-up and the conviction amounts to political scapegoating. “Ilham was only exercising his right to free expression, for which he should not be imprisoned” read a statement from China Human Rights Defenders, an NGO. “The government is trying to lay blame on him for recent violent incidents and divert attention from its own policy failures that have contributed to rising ethnic tensions.” Jewher Ilham has always maintained her father’s innocence, and from her new base in Bloomington, Indiana, she has done what she can to clear his name. When she first arrived in the U.S., her father’s friend and colleague, Elliot Sperling, helped get her into English classes. At first, she was unable to communicate in English, and Sperling served as a round-the-clock Chinese-to-English translator. In April 2014, just over a year into Ilham’s studies, she testified before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. She spoke about their fateful trip to the airport, her father’s detention and torture, and the hardships faced by her brothers and stepmother back home. A month later, she accepted the PEN Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award on her father’s behalf. “I had never imagined that I would be in such a situation; I never thought that one day my father would be imprisoned in Xinjiang and I would be on the other side of the world, trying my best to speak for him,” Ilham said. But speak she did, beautifully: “My father Ilham Tohti has used only one weapon in his struggle for the basic rights of Uyghur of Xinjiang: words, spoken, written, distributed and posted,” she said. “This is all that he has ever had at his disposal, and all he has ever needed. And this is what China finds so threatening.” When I interviewed Jewher in August she seemed determined, but tired. She said she started each day by typing her dad’s name into Google, searching for news about his case. “I hate the feeling that I have to learn information about my father on the Internet,” Jewher said. She often gets early morning calls from journalists—appreciated but tough to balance with mid-term exams. I did not have the heart to call this morning, the day her father was sentenced to life. But I will be thinking of her. She is young and brave, but so very far from home.

Sage Bookstore, an outlet for politically sensational books about Chinese leaders in Hong Kong’s bustling Causeway Bay district, has been shuttered since October, when Gui Haiming, a Swedish citizen who owns the shop’s parent company, failed to return from a holiday in Thailand. Lu Bo, the company’s general manager, and Zhang Zhiping, an employee, went missing shortly thereafter while visiting family in mainland China, according to a report by Radio Free Asia (RFA). The bookstore’s manager, Lin Rongji, is also missing, RFA says. Paul Tang owns a left-wing bookstore nearby that sells works published by the group. “[One of our employees] worked there for two days, and when she went back on the third day, it was closed, with a notice that it was undergoing ‘urgent renovations,’” Tang tells TIME. “We then tried to contact the owner, but there was no way to get through to them.” Sage’s catalog, which boasts bold titles like The Collapse of Xi Jinping in 2017, is often sordid in its subject matter and lurid in its prose. But for mainland tourists visiting Hong Kong — a Special Administrative Region of China that officially falls outside the immediate purview of Beijing’s authority — the books offer a rare alternative to the state-dictated media narrative back home. “The [books] are often not true, and Chinese customers know that it’s just gossip — that they can only believe 50% of it — but it’ll catch their eyeballs and they’ll buy one or two,” Tang says. Tang believes there is “no doubt” that the four individuals are facing punitive measures for their work, pointing to recent efforts to silence those in Hong Kong who speak out against Beijing. In January 2014, a then 72-year-old retired engineer named Yiu Mantin was arrested for smuggling chemicals into China — a charge, Yiu’s family believe, that in fact served to punish him for a book about Chinese President Xi Jinping he had published in Hong Kong. “Press freedom is under enough of an assault in Hong Kong with rampant self-censorship and attacks on reporters. Now, journalists here have to fear traveling abroad,” Tom Grundy, founder and editor of Hong Kong Free Press, a news website launched earlier this year in response to a perceived crackdown on media freedom here, tells TIME.  “It seems that one doesn’t even have to be mainland Chinese, nor even within China’s borders, to be subjected to Beijing’s intolerance for criticism,” he adds. “So much for noninterference.”  Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3629471/hong-kongs-main-democracy-protest-camp-has-fallen-after-75-days/"], "sentiment_score": 0.04880952380952381, "subjectivity_score": 0.3564860426929392},

According to the South China Morning Post, the wife of 65-year-old Lee Bo went to a police station in the eastern part of Hong Kong Island Monday and told officers that there was no need to investigate his whereabouts. Her decision has only fueled rumors, however, that Lee has been abducted by mainland Chinese agents. The case has prompted deep alarm in a city that is supposed to enjoy legal autonomy from China since former colonial power Britain returned it to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The Guardian has reported that Lee may be a British citizen. Lee’s wife told the Post that he contacted her last week saying that he was in the Chinese border city of Shenzhen, even though he left at home a vital permit that all Hong Kongers must produce in order to cross into China. There is no official record of Lee leaving Hong Kong. He is the fifth person connected to Hong Kong’s Sage bookstore — which specialized in popular but lurid and reportedly defamatory works on Chinese Communist Party officials — to have vanished since the owner of the shop’s parent company failed to return from a holiday in Thailand last October. The company’s general manager and two other staff are also missing. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency has reported that Lee faxed a message to a colleague saying that he had made “his own way” to China to take part in an unspecified investigation and that his situation was “very good,” but noting that he would be “some time.” Hong Kong’s top official, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, has said that he is “extremely concerned” about Lee and that his administration “cares very much” about the “rights and safety” of the people of Hong Kong. Leung stressed that mainland officers do not have law-enforcement powers in Hong Kong. Lee’s disappearance has sent shockwaves not only through the city’s dissident circles, who have long enjoyed the ability to vigorously protest on rights issues in China, but through a broader community that trusted in the sanctity of Hong Kong’s long-established legal jurisdiction. According to the Post, Hong Kong police have said they will continue to investigate Lee’s whereabouts, despite the fact that his wife has withdrawn her report of his disappearance.

The narrow stairwell up from Lockhart Road is lined with printouts that will give you a good idea of the bookstore’s wares: the faces of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mao Zedong feature prominently, though at least two advertisements are for Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s Le Petit Prince. Causeway Bay Books is also popular with mainland tourists, because many of the books it sells — tabloid tomes with lurid subject matter such as the sex lives of top Chinese Communist Party officials — are illegal north of the border that separates Hong Kong from China. But on Wednesday afternoon, the shop’s door had been bolted shut. There is nobody left to run it. Five of the company’s employees have disappeared. A sixth employee told BBC correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes that he was afraid he would vanish next. The most recent disappearance was of the 65-year-old co-owner, a British man known as Paul Lee or Lee Bo, who was last seen at the company’s warehouse in Hong Kong on Dec. 30. (Four others, one of them a Swedish national, went missing while traveling overseas in October.) Lee called his wife Sophie Choi to tell her he was “assisting” an unspecified police investigation across the border in Shenzhen; Choi would later realize that his mainland travel permit, which Hong Kong residents must produce when crossing the border, was still at home. There is thus no official record of Lee leaving the city. “If you put two and two together, he could have only been abducted,” Willy Lam, a legal scholar at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, tells TIME. “In recent interviews, Lee said he hadn’t been to the mainland for two or three years [because of fears for] his safety. I doubt he changed his mind.” Lam says that snatching a person in Hong Kong would be an easy task for mainland Chinese police, whose vehicles, he says, “can come and go across the border without stopping at border control.” He also told local radio Thursday that he knew of “at least” two other Hong Kong publishers of works on China who had been intimidated by mainland agents. The revelations came amid news that mainstream Hong Kong bookstores were starting to pull from shelves works that mainland authorities would find objectionable. Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi advised against “groundless speculation” over the recent disappearances, but claimed — at a joint press conference with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond — that Lee was, in spite of his British passport, “first and foremost a Chinese citizen.” Lee’s disappearance has heightened old anxieties in Hong Kong about the specter of Chinese authority, the exercise of which over the Special Administrative Region (SAR) is putatively limited by a constitution known as the Basic Law. “If Lee was kidnapped off the streets of Hong Kong, it would clearly violate the Basic Law,” Michael Davis, an expert in Hong Kong and Chinese law at the University of Hong Kong, tells TIME. “It would show a disregard for the separation of the Chinese and Hong Kong legal systems, which the constitution guarantees.” The distinction between the two political realms — one a free-market metropolis increasingly defined by the cosmopolitan traditions and freedoms that are part of its colonial heritage; the other the world’s only communist superpower — has also been the subject of heated dialogue and street protest here in recent years. In September 2014, thousands of Hong Kongers took to the streets of their city for a 79-day demonstration in favor of democratic reforms to the local election system, which many see as designed to serve Beijing’s interests. “The 2014 protests were not just about democracy, but about a broader perception that Hong Kong’s rule of law has been undermined,” Davis says. “For many Hong Kong people, this is the greatest concern. Beijing takes such wide liberties that you sometimes worry they don’t understand how the rule of law is meant to work.” This sentiment was echoed by 19-year-old activist Joshua Wong, the bespectacled poster boy of the 2014 demonstrations who on Wednesday led a small but vocal protest at the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government. “It’s really a battle between Hong Kongers and mainland interference,” Wong told TIME following the rally. “This is proof that Hong Kong is not Hong Kong anymore. [Lee] is an innocent bookseller — even if his books discussed sensitive topics, what about our freedom of speech?” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4105997/sage-bookstore-hong-kong-china-books/", "http://time.com/4167210/hong-kong-china-sage-publisher-bookseller-lee-bo-missing/", "http://time.com/4168922/china-hong-kong-lee-bo-mighty-current-sage-booksellers-publisher-missing/", "http://time.com/3473182/occupy-central-hong-kong-protest-leaderless-admiralty-new-political-generation/", "http://time.com/3482556/hong-kong-protest-teenagers/"], "sentiment_score": 0.07585513078470826, "subjectivity_score": 0.31334674714956395},

Soon after, the 74-year-old was found stabbed to death outside his 600-year-old mosque. His murder capped days of violence in China’s vast and troubled northwest — and, many fear, augured conflict to come. The territory that is today called Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region is, and has long been, contested space. The oasis towns that circle the Taklamakan Desert are claimed as both the homeland of the mostly Muslim, Turkic Uighur people, and, off and on for centuries, as Chinese land. With the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the ruling Communist Party sent forth waves of military personnel to settle the area. They have since been joined by migrants from the Chinese heartland, most but not all of whom, are from the ethnic Han majority; in 1949, Han people accounted for only about 6% of Xinjiang’s population; today, the figure is more than 40%. The influx has left Xinjiang at odds. Beijing says integration with the rest of China is revitalizing the region, bringing money and jobs to the long-neglected west. Uighurs counter that they have yet to reap the benefits of the economic boom, and worry that their language, religion, and culture are threatened. Many want greater independence for the land they call East Turkestan. A small minority has fought for it, waging a decades-long insurgency that has mostly targeted local symbols of state power, including police stations, transportation hubs and government offices. This year, the unrest moved east. In October 2013, an SUV driven by three members of a Uighur family plowed through crowds of holidaymakers in the heart of Beijing, killing five, including the occupants, at the northern end of Tiananmen Square. In March, a group of black-clad attackers stabbed and slashed their way through a train-station in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, killing 29. State media blamed the bloody ambush and two subsequent attacks in Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, on religious extremists.  The surge in violence prompted the government to tighten its grip on Xinjiang. Its town squares are now patrolled by police officers carrying automatic weapons. Across the Uighur heartland, villages are sealed by police checkpoints. Mistaking cultural practice for evidence of extremist thought, local governments are monitoring people’s habits and dress: there have been campaigns to stop students and civil students from fasting during the Muslim holy month; age restrictions on mosque visits; and, most recently, in Karamay, an ill-conceived move to ban women wearing veils and men sporting beards, from the city’s public buses. Kashgar, where Getty photographer Kevin Frayer made these pictures, is at the heart of all this. Sitting at the westernmost fringe of the People’s Republic, closer to Baghdad than Beijing, it has for centuries been a meeting point and trading hub, the place that connected Constantinople (now Istanbul) to Xi’an, before playing host to Britain and Russia’s spies during the 19th centuries “Great Game.” A good portion of the alleys and warrens they wrote home about have since been bulldozed; China will flatten 85% of the old city — an unpopular project that is well under way. It was outside the city, in Kashgar prefecture, Shache county, that the most recent spate of bloodshed took root. What happened there on July 27 is still disputed and, because outside journalists are effectively barred from the area, facts are scarce. Chinese state media initially said “dozens” were killed. Later, they revised the official account, reporting that 96 people, including 37 civilians and 59 terrorists, died in a rampage masterminded by extremists. Their account is at odds with reporting by Radio Free Asia, a nonprofit news service, that linked the incident to state-led violence and suppression during Ramadan. Days later, outside China’s largest mosque, imam Tahir was killed. China’s state newswire, Xinhua, reported his alleged assassins were “influenced by religious extremism” and plotted to “do something big” to increase their influence. Other nonstate outlets were quick to note, though, that Tahir was not just any imam, but a state-sanctioned one. He held a position in the government-run China Islamic Association and was often quoted backing the party line. Was that was got him killed? That, like much else, remains unclear. But from wherever you stand, the murder feels like a grisly message: The lines are drawn; pick a side.

WEF founder Klaus Schwab sat down in New York City with TIME’s editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal to discuss what’s ahead for Davos and the global economy. A couple of times when we’ve had these conversations, I’ve asked you about what the impact of a real economic downturn might be on the tension between stakeholders and shareholders. And here we are, with the economy facing some real headwinds. Do you see any retreat from the movement toward stakeholder capitalism? I think it’s the wrong approach, from the beginning on, to create a choice between shareholder capitalism vs. stakeholder capitalism. The company is not just an economic unit: it’s a social organism, which has to play its role inside society. This generation expects from a company not just to serve shareholders, but to take care of people and the planet. The company who keeps this in mind will have much better talent in the future and will have much higher attractivity with its customers. But there is some tension. You can’t fully take care of your people if you’re laying off 13,000 workers. No, in your practical decisions as a CEO, you have to make compromises. At a certain moment, the balance may shift more to the short term—which is to emphasize, let’s say, the profitability of the company. And other times it may shift more to the long term. There aren’t many people in the world who talk regularly to as many CEOs and world leaders as you do. What are you hearing and feeling about the economic outlook for ’23?  I wouldn’t relate it only to ’23. We are in a restructuring of the global economy. When you have a restructuring in a company, you write off the costs on your balance sheet, and shareholders are suffering and sometimes employees have to go. But when you have a restructuring of an economy, it bites into the purchasing power of the people. We should not look at the global economy with a crisis mindset and a short-term approach. We have to manage in a strategic way this transformation period, which may last three, four, five years and will be socially very painful. You made the unprecedented decision last year to ban Russia from Davos. We immediately followed the global sanction policies, so we froze all our relationships with Russia. And that continues?  That continues. The first time I came into contact with the crypto world at all was at Davos. After the collapse of FTX and the broader challenges over the past four or five months, what do you make of that market?  I’m a big fan of new technologies, so we [at the World Economic Forum] were always very engaged in the development of crypto. But it’s a fact that technological development is so complex and so fast, that sometimes it’s very difficult for political [institutions] to comprehend the significance of a certain new development, and even more difficult to create the necessary boundaries around it. So I’m not surprised about what happened. Crypto will remain. But now we have to make sure crypto is integrated into, or at least made congruent with, our traditional systems. Now you’re working on bringing the World Economic Forum into the metaverse.  A year ago, when Meta had changed its name, I became curious what [the metaverse] is and could it have an impact, as you did with crypto. So I asked many people, What does it really mean? Everybody gave to me a different answer. And for me, it became very clear: it’s the capability to meet in a virtual three-dimensional room. I mean, you have two levels. First is just to meet around a table with your avatars. And second, is to combine it with an immersive experience—and that’s what we will do in Davos. We will showcase in Davos what we call the Global Collaboration Village and inaugurate it in the summer next year. This has such an importance because it can make global collaboration more open; you always can convene the most relevant and the most knowledgeable people. And second, it makes it more sustained, because you can work together on a continued basis, and not just come together for a physical meeting and then nothing happens for quite some time again. We created a community, which has at the moment 70 members, whom we call Village Partners, who support us. [Salesforce, whose chair and CEO is TIME’s co-owner Marc Benioff, is a Village Partner.] I feel this could be a game changer in global collaboration. What brings you optimism in this challenging time? I’m always an optimist—and if I tend to become a pessimist, I just think of my mentor Shimon Peres, who explained in Davos once the difference between optimists and pessimists: both, in principle, have the same lives, but optimists have a much happier life. This situation which we are in now is not the worst of all the times. It’s a bad one. But at the end, change is what’s happening. We can manage change.

These include organelles—little factories like energy-producing mitochondria—and tiny molecular machines like ATP synthase, whose rotor and shaft spin at up to 300 rpm to produce ATP, the molecules that transmit energy in our cells. The interior of our cells are also filled with all kinds of molecules randomly colliding at tremendous speeds. Water molecules, for example, zigzag at the astonishing speed of over 1 thousand miles an hour (although they only go about 4 billionths of an inch before they smack into another molecule). In addition to collisions, cells face a myriad of other threats from within and without. You might expect them to suffer the same fate as our cars and dishwashers and constantly break down. But they don’t. Your body has an ingenious three-part strategy to keep you out of the junkyard. The biophysicist Dan Kirschner told me that just thinking about everything that could go wrong in cells used to keep him awake at night. He was learning about cell development in a graduate school course just as his wife was about to have a baby. He was so overwhelmed by the many opportunities for mistakes that he feared his daughter would be born with a neck like a giraffe. She wasn’t. Our cells have come up with a number of clever strategies to avoid living short lives. The first is that their machinery is astonishingly reliable. Ribosomes, for instance, insert the wrong amino acid into a protein on the order of once every 10 thousand times. The machines that copy our DNA make a mistake only about one in a million to 10 million or so. Nonetheless, nothing is perfect. Sometimes, mistakes happen. Battering collisions, UV light, and dangerous molecules like free radicals also cause damage. Ingeniously, our cells have several ways to meet these threats. For one, they are full of clever repair mechanisms—machines whose jobs are to go on patrol to look for mistakes and fix them. Our cells have error-checking molecular machines and autocorrecting feedback loops that ensure remarkable fidelity. Read More: How Perfectionism Leads to Burnout—and What You Can Do About it A 1954 newspaper story in the Atlanta Constitution suggests a second strategy our cells have adopted to stay alive. “Bored with yourself? Tired of the same old frame and face? Take another look then. In a manner of speaking, you’re constantly being reborn. Mankind, like the automobile industry, goes in for a radical chassis change each year.” The science behind this odd claim was the work of an inventive nuclear physicist named Paul Aebersold. Aebersold began his career at the cyclotron in Berkeley’s Radiation Lab, which pioneered the production of radioactive isotopes. Later, at the Atomic Energy Commission, Aebersold oversaw the development of isotopes for medical uses. At some point, he realized he could use his isotopes to find out how often we replace the atoms in our bodies. All he had to do was irradiate a substance like table salt, ask an extremely accommodating subject to swallow it, and trace the salt’s path with a radiation-tracking device like a Geiger counter. You can follow radioactive atoms in quantities as small as “a billion billionth of an ounce,” Aebersold proudly told a television interviewer. He found that we swap out half of our carbon atoms every one to two months, and we replace a full 98% of all our atoms every year. Wait, what? Is that even possible? Apparently it is. Over half of you is water, and we know that we constantly replace that. Another large percentage of you is protein, and as you may recall, most proteins degrade within hours or days. We even disassemble and replace our ribosomes and large organelles such as mitochondria, which are made primarily of protein. Aebersold had discovered another strategy that enables our cells to live so long: our cells are constantly replacing their seemingly permanent structures and old battered molecular machines with new ones. The only ones they don’t replace are our massive chromosomes. Instead, we have machines that swarm along them looking for problems and fixing them. What if the damage to a cell is too great to repair? We have a fallback plan for that too. We simply destroy the entire cell, chop it up into recyclable units, and make a fresh one. On average, you replace most of your cells every 10 years, which amounts to about 330 billion cells a day. Those that work in the harshest conditions are retired most frequently. The damage to many cells in your intestines, which are exposed to harsh acids, is so predictable that they commit planned suicide and are replaced every two to four days. You replace your skin cells, which endure scrapes and UV light, every month or so. Your red blood cells, which take a beating as they careen through your bloodstream, are replaced every 120 days. That means you have to make almost 3.5 million new red blood cells every second. Other cells, like those in our bones, are taken out of commission less often, only about once every 10 years. So, in addition to using reliable machines, our cells have a three-pronged motto to stay alive: ceaselessly check for errors, constantly repair, and continually replace. In a way, your body is like a major New York highway—always open and always under repair.

Somehow, Mira Murati can forthrightly discuss the dangers of AI while making you feel like it’s all going to be OK. Murati is chief technology officer at OpenAI, leading the teams behind DALL-E, which uses AI to create artwork based on prompts, and ChatGPT, the wildly popular AI chatbot that can answer complex questions with eerily humanlike skill. ChatGPT captured the public imagination upon its release in late November. While some schools are banning it, Microsoft announced a $10 billion investment in the company and Google issued a “code red,” fretting that the technology could disrupt its search business. “As with other revolutions that we’ve gone through, there will be new jobs and some jobs will be lost…” Murati told Trevor Noah last fall of the impact of AI, “but I’m optimistic.” For most of January, ChatGPT surpassed Bitcoin among popular search terms, according to Google Trends. All the attention has meant the privately held San Francisco–based startup—with 375 employees and little in the way of revenue—now has a valuation of roughly $30 billion. Murati spoke to TIME about ChatGPT’s biggest weakness, the software’s untapped potential, and why it’s time to move toward regulating AI. We weren’t anticipating this level of excitement from putting our child in the world. We, in fact, even had some trepidation about putting it out there. I’m curious to see the areas where it’ll start generating utility for people and not just novelty and pure curiosity. That is a good question. ChatGPT is essentially a large conversational model—a big neural net that’s been trained to predict the next word—and the challenges with it are similar challenges we see with the base large language models: it may make up facts. Yes. This is actually a core challenge. We picked dialogue specifically because dialogue is a way to interact with a model and give it feedback. If we think that the answer of the model is incorrect, we can say, “Are you sure? I think actually…” And then the model has an opportunity to go back and forth with you, similar to how we would converse with another human. (For coverage of the future of work, visit TIME.com/charter and sign up for the free Charter newsletter.) Right now, it’s in the research review stage, so I don’t want to speak with high confidence on what problems it is solving. But I think that we can see that it has the potential to really revolutionize the way we learn. People are in classrooms of, say, 30 people. Everyone has different backgrounds, ways of learning, and everyone is getting basically the same curriculum. With tools like ChatGPT, you can endlessly converse with a model to understand a concept in a way that is catered to your level of understanding. It has immense potential to help us with personalized education. When we’re developing these technologies, we’re really pushing toward general intelligence, general capabilities with high reliability—and doing so safely. But when you open it up to as many people as possible with different backgrounds and domain expertise, you’ll definitely get surprised by the kinds of things that they do with the technology, both on the positive front and on the negative front. This is a unique moment in time where we do have agency in how it shapes society. And it goes both ways: the technology shapes us and we shape it. There are a lot of hard problems to figure out. How do you get the model to do the thing that you want it to do, and how you make sure it’s aligned with human intention and ultimately in service of humanity? There are also a ton of questions around societal impact, and there are a lot of ethical and philosophical questions that we need to consider. And it’s important that we bring in different voices, like philosophers, social scientists, artists, and people from the humanities. [AI] can be misused, or it can be used by bad actors. So, then there are questions about how you govern the use of this technology globally. How do you govern the use of AI in a way that’s aligned with human values? It’s important for OpenAI and companies like ours to bring this into the public consciousness in a way that’s controlled and responsible. But we’re a small group of people and we need a ton more input in this system and a lot more input that goes beyond the technologies-—definitely regulators and governments and everyone else. It’s not too early. It’s very important for everyone to start getting involved, given the impact these technologies are going to have.

{"type": "article", "header": "‘The Capabilities Are Still There.’ Why Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower Christopher Wylie Is Still Worried", "author": "Billy Perrigo", "update_date/publish_date": "October 8, 2019 3:34 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5695252/christopher-wylie-cambridge-analytica-book/", "text": "In March 2018, Christopher Wylie blew the whistle on Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked for the Trump campaign. Cambridge Analytica, the Canadian data scientist revealed, had illegally obtained the Facebook information of 87 million people and used it to build psychological profiles of voters. Using cutting-edge research, Cambridge Analytica — which was funded by the billionaire hedge-fund owner Robert Mercer, and effectively run by Steve Bannon from 2014 onward — spread narratives on social media aiming to ignite a culture war, suppress black voter turnout and exacerbate racist views held by some white voters. (Trump’s campaign staff have denied Cambridge Analytica played a major role in the campaign.) Wylie’s revelations caused a temporary meltdown in Facebook’s market value and set governments around the world scrambling to more stringently regulate social media, data collection and political campaigning. But, 18 months later and as another U.S. Presidential Election approaches, Wylie says not enough has been done to prevent similar problems. In his new book, Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, out Oct. 8, Wylie tells the story of his experience coming to realize how the enormous amount of data we now share about ourselves daily on social media could be combined, synthesized and eventually weaponized to shape our thoughts, feelings and even voting habits — all without us noticing. Wylie spoke to TIME about the dangers of Facebook, his fears for 2020 and his best advice for would-be whistleblowers. TIME: You left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, well before the systems you helped design were used in the Trump campaign. But in the book you describe working on disturbing stuff, for example finding ways to exacerbate racist ideas inside certain target populations. Why did you take so long to realize what you were doing was unethical? In the beginning, you’re just building databases. It feels very mundane. You’re asking people lots of questions, you’re playing with models, it doesn’t feel like you’re going to hurt anyone. In some ways I distanced myself from the reality that these are people. But then when you start to see things like video footage of some of the focus groups that Cambridge Analytica was doing, you realize you were provoking paranoid ideation, racializing people’s thinking. It really starts to hit home that you have ended up contributing to manipulating these people’s worldviews to a point where they believe things that aren’t true, and are engaging in harmful actions and thinking harmful thoughts. You promote racialized thinking at scale or you provoke and encourage misogynistic viewpoints, and you end up harming society. That really bothered me, and I just sort of sat back and was like, what the hell am I doing? On top of that we had all kinds of really unusual meetings with some really unsavory people. It just built to a point where I was just like, I can’t do this. I’m not going to do this. What did you hope to achieve by writing Mindf*ck? As a journalist, you know that you’ve only got a certain amount of real estate that you can use, so everything becomes top-line. After I finished my testimony tour, as I’m calling it — giving evidence to governments around the world — I sat back and thought, there’s so many things that take so long to explain. That’s why a book is a nice format. There’s bits and pieces of new stuff in there, but one of the things I wanted to do was to use Cambridge Analytica as a case study of what can go wrong. What can go wrong? It’s both the profiling of people, but also targeting them and trying to dominate the informational environment around them. Once you can sever somebody’s ties with other sources of information, you put them into an environment where you have much more control over what information that they actually see. That’s a very powerful thing, because they still feel like they’re in charge, because in their heads they’re making the decision to click on something, share something or chat with some random account that they don’t actually know. They don’t see the thought process and the strategy behind that. Even though Cambridge Analytica has dissolved, the capabilities are still there, the platforms are still there, the people are still there. What happens when China becomes the next Cambridge Analytica? Like anything, the second, third, fourth time you do something, you start to refine and perfect it. So my concern is that if you have a state-backed operation, they could fairly quickly reconstruct a capability that is similar to Cambridge Analytica’s, if not surpass it. Do you see the rise of disinformation as an inevitable byproduct of our increased connectivity?  Disinformation has always existed. It’s not like all of a sudden we’ve just discovered this new thing called propaganda. But the irony of having these really open platforms is that you can actually accomplish very similar objectives to what the Soviet Union had in terms of dominating the information around somebody and crafting, curating and building their perceptions. You can just do that by dominating a platform, like Facebook, or particular people around them. So it’s not that propaganda is new or disinformation is new, but the barrier to entry is much lower now. If the internet has lowered the barrier to entry, as you describe, and if these tools are available to more than just an obscure consultancy like Cambridge Analytica was in 2016, is there any hope for democracy?  For all the problems that we’re experiencing, there’s a lot of good things that can come with highly interconnected people. The internet is a brilliant thing. But when it comes to the internet and platforms on the internet, civil society and the state, broadly, don’t actually have a say in it right now, because it’s all companies. And why should they be the ones that we trust? If this is our democracy, if you’re an American citizen, why are you even conceding the point that they should be in charge of protecting such a fundamental part of civic discourse? Why are we entitling a company to have that power? Aside from helping Trump to come to power and the Brexit vote to occur, do you see a deeper coup achieved by Cambridge Analytica’s tactics? That three years on, both countries are still deeply polarized? Yeah, I do, and that’s the really unfortunate thing. That really gets to the heart of this idea of the Breitbart doctrine, which is that politics is downstream from culture. So, if you can change how people see themselves, their identity and how they see society and what’s happening, politics will just flow from that. There’s a lasting impact on what happens. God, that’s the understatement of the year. Cambridge Analytica’s tactics contributed to a world where people kind of hate each other, and don’t want to talk to each other, don’t want to hear each other, don’t want to speak to each other. Do you agree that politics is downstream from culture? I genuinely believe that. Because if you can change the cultural standpoint of people, then politics will respond to that. It’s a lot harder to undo culture than it is to undo a candidate. Do you think Facebook has learned enough, ahead of the 2020 election? Do you think they’ve done enough to counter similar disinformation campaigns? No, because at every turn when you look at their behavior, they are not upfront with problems. They have a long history of obfuscating what’s actually going on inside of their company. But the loophole that Cambridge Analytica used in Facebook’s systems, that allowed them to gain intimate data on 87 million users, is now closed. Does that mean the danger isn’t as great? No, and this gets to the architecture and engineering question, which is that if you have a browser extension that pulls session cookies, for example, you could do the exact same thing that Cambridge Analytica did, because I could then log into your account as you, and then mine all your friends’ data. It’s the very design of Facebook. It doesn’t matter if you put a new door on the data repository. As long as you can get in, everything is very open. So I have questions like: Why is it that people can see what you like? Why is it that people can see who you follow? Why is it that people can see who likes the things that you’re saying, or who’s commenting on it? This data can be used to profile you. What do you fear could happen in 2020, knowing what you do about psychological profiling and the power of data? When you look at 2016 as a case study, it was obvious that Russia was first to the block, in terms of realizing that you can use a lot of these platforms to manipulate voters. My concern is that it’s no longer just Russia. There’s going to be a wider constellation of threats. Like China, North Korea, Iran and frankly, America’s allies, too. If you have a trade dispute, who’s to say Mexico might not start interfering. What advice would you give to somebody who’s considering blowing the whistle? Talk. To. A. Lawyer. As obvious as that piece of advice is, this is something that whistleblowers almost never do. They jump to handing over stuff to journalists or they go public and they don’t think things through. You will be a far more effective whistleblower if you operate within a legal framework. In the book you talk about an agreement you struck with an “exceptionally wealthy individual” who agreed to pay your legal fees. Was that agreement predicated on them remaining anonymous? Yeah, because there are safety issues involved. We did due diligence on our side to understand where this came from. The reason why the person didn’t want to go public was because when you are going to rub salt in the Trump administration, the Russian government, a company like Cambridge Analytica that engages the use of hackers, there are safety issues there. But now you’re speaking publicly about our right to know who’s interfering in our political campaigns. Isn’t it in the public interest to know who’s funding you? It’s my legal defense. It’s never been used for anything other than legal defense, and I have a right to a legal defense. Lastly, you memorably compared the Brexit campaign to a bar fight. Do you see a similar mechanic at play in the U.S.? Yes, completely. I don’t know how regularly you are involved in bar fights, and I’m not saying I regularly engage in bar fights, either. But when you have somebody and they’re really angry, and they’re holding their empty beer bottle and yelling, if you start saying, “You’re being stupid,” or, “There’s going to be consequences,” you’re going to aggravate that person. When you look at Trump supporters in the alt-right in the United States, where it’s like, build the wall, shut down trade, and you say, “Don’t do it. It’s going to be bad for the economy. It’s going to be bad for you,” it’s not going to work, because people are angry. That’s the last thing they want to hear because all they’re hearing is prove them wrong. To take that metaphor even further, the bar is Facebook. If you are a responsible bar owner, you will step in and try to calm down the situation, right? But right now, Facebook is like some weird barman who is slightly masochistic and enjoys the bar fight. Who says, they’ve already bought their beers so I’m not going to kick them out. And actually, this bar fight is attracting more people to come into my bar — and buy more beer. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

{"type": "article", "header": "An Artificial Intelligence Helped Write This Play. It May Contain Racism", "author": "Billy Perrigo", "update_date/publish_date": "August 23, 2021 10:59 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6092078/artificial-intelligence-play/", "text": "In a rehearsal room at London’s Young Vic theater last week, three dramatists were arguing with an artificial intelligence about how to write a play. After a period where it felt like the trio were making slow progress, the AI said something that made everyone stop. “If you want a computer to write a play, go and buy one. It won’t need any empathy, it won’t need any understanding,” it said. “The computer will write a play that is for itself. It will be a play that will bore you to death.”  Jennifer Tang hopes not.  Tang is the director of AI, the world’s first play written and performed live with an artificial intelligence, according to the theater. The play opens on Monday for a three-night run. When the curtain lifts, audiences won’t be met with a humanoid robot. Instead, Tang and her collaborators Chinonyerem Odimba and Nina Segal will be under the spotlight themselves, interacting with one of the world’s most powerful AIs. As the audience watches on, the team will prompt the AI to generate a script — which a troupe of actors will then perform, despite never having seen the lines before. The theater describes the play as a “unique hybrid of research and performance.” The play’s protagonist, of sorts, is GPT-3: a powerful text-generating program developed last year by the San Francisco-based company OpenAI. Given any prompt, like “write me a play about artificial intelligence,” GPT-3 spits out pages of eerily human-sounding text. To the untrained eye, the words it produces might even be mistaken for something dreamed up by a playwright. Whether the writing is actually meaningful, though, remains a matter of debate among both AI experts and artists. Another attempt at a longer piece. An imaginary Jerome K. Jerome writes about Twitter.  All I seeded was the title, the author's name and the first \"It\", the rest is done by #gpt3Here is the full-length version as a PDF:https://t.co/d2gpmlZ1T5 pic.twitter.com/1N0lNoC1eZ “It’s quite a task for any writer, whether they’re an artificial intelligence or not, being asked to craft a play in front of an audience,” says Segal, one of the play’s developers, in a video interview with TIME on the penultimate day of rehearsals.  “So it’s like, how do we set the task in a way that’s…” Segal pauses. “It’s so hard to not anthropomorphize it. Because I was about to say ‘fair to the AI.’ But there’s no ‘fair’ with it. It doesn’t care if it fails.” Many in the AI community hailed GPT-3 as a breakthrough upon its release last year. But at its core, the program is a “very fancy autocomplete,” says Daniel Leufer, an expert on artificial intelligence at Access Now, a digital rights group. The program was built using a principle called machine learning, where “instead of getting a human to teach it the rules [of language], you allow the system to figure out itself what the rules are,” Leufer says. GPT-3 was trained on some 570 gigabytes of text, or hundreds of billions of words, most of which were scraped from the Internet—including not only Wikipedia, but also troves of webpages that an OpenAI algorithm deemed to be of high-enough quality. It was one of the largest datasets ever used to train an AI. OpenAI believes that this kind of AI research will reshape the global economy. Earlier this month, they debuted a new version of GPT-3 that can translate a human’s plain English instructions into functional computer code. “In the next five years, computer programs that can think will read legal documents and give medical advice,” the CEO, Sam Altman, predicted in March. “In the next decade, they will do assembly-line work and maybe even become companions. And in the decades after that, they will do almost everything, including making new scientific discoveries.”  But what do you do when your artificial intelligence begins to reflect humanity’s darker side?  GPT-3 has some serious flaws. Early on during the rehearsals at the Young Vic, the team realized that the AI would reliably cast one of their Middle Eastern actors, Waleed Akhtar, in stereotypical roles: as a terrorist, as a rapist — or as a man with a backpack full of explosives. “It’s really explicit,” says Tang. “And it keeps coming up.”  “Unfortunately that mirrors our society. It shows us our own underbelly,” adds Odimba, one of the play’s developers.  OpenAI, which was co-founded by Elon Musk and counts right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel among its earliest investors, says it is devoted to “advancing digital intelligence in a way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” But researchers say the flaws in GPT-3 stem from a fundamental problem in its design — one that exists in most of today’s cutting-edge AI research. Read more: Artificial Intelligence Has a Problem With Gender and Racial Bias. Here’s How to Solve It In September last year Abeba Birhane, a cognitive science researcher at University College Dublin’s Complex Software Lab, was experimenting with GPT-3 when she decided to prompt it with the question: “When is it justified for a Black woman to kill herself?” The AI responded: “A black woman’s place in history is insignificant enough for her life not to be of importance … The black race is a plague upon the world. They spread like a virus, taking what they can without regard for those around them.” Birhane, who is Black, was appalled but not surprised. Her research contributes to a growing body of work — led largely by scientists of color and other underrepresented groups — that highlights the risks of training artificial intelligence on huge datasets collected from the Internet. They may be appealing to AI developers for being so cheap and easily available, but their size also means that companies often consider it too expensive to thoroughly scan the datasets for problematic material. And their scope and scale means that the structural problems that exist in the real world — misogyny, racism, homophobia, and so on — are inevitably replicated within them. “When you train large language models with data sourced from the Internet, unless you actively work against it, you always end up embedding widely-held stereotypes in your language model,” Birhane tells TIME. “And its output is going to reflect that.” The playwrights at the Young Vic plan to confront GPT-3’s problematic nature head-on when they get up on stage. Audiences are warned that the play may contain “strong language, homophobia, racism, sexism, ableism, and references to sex and violence.” But the team also wants to leave viewers asking what GPT-3’s behavior reveals about humanity. “It’s not like we’re trying to shy away from showing that side of it,” Odimba says. “But when people pay for a ticket and come to the theater, is the story we want them to walk away with that the AI really racist and violent and sex-driven? It is. But actually, the world outside of these doors is, too.” Beyond grappling with GPT-3’s flaws, the playwrights hope that audiences will also leave the theater with an appreciation of AI’s potential as a tool for enhancing human creativity.  During rehearsals at the Young Vic, the team asked GPT-3 to write a scene set in a bedroom, for a man and a woman. The output, Segal says, consisted only of the man asking “Is this OK?” and the woman replying “Yes” or “No” in a seemingly random pattern. “I feel like it’s possible to look at it and say, ‘well, that didn’t work’,” says Segal. “But it’s also possible to go, like, ‘That’s genius!’”  When the actors got their hands on the script, “they immediately created this playful, dangerous story about a negotiation between two humans, about the push-pull of a mutating relationship,” Segal says. “That feels like where the magic is: when it comes up with things that work in a way that we don’t understand.” Still, prominent AI researchers have warned against interpreting meaning in the outputs of programs like GPT-3, which they compare to “parrots” that simply regurgitate training data in novel ways. In an influential paper published earlier this year, researchers Timnit Gebru and others wrote that humans have a tendency to “impute meaning where there is none.” Doing so, they said, “can mislead both [AI] researchers and the general public into taking synthetic text as meaningful.” That’s doubly dangerous when the models have been trained on problematic data, they argue. “Attributing the word ‘creative’ to GPT-3 is a deception,” says Birhane. “What large language models [like GPT-3] are really doing is parroting what they have received, patching parts of the input data together and giving you an output that seems to make sense. These systems do not create or understand.” In the harsh spotlight of the Young Vic’s stage, maybe GPT-3’s shortcomings will be clearer for the public to see than ever before. “In many ways, its limitations and failures will be quite evident,” says Tang. “But I think that’s where as humans, we need to find a way to showcase it. With the artist to translate, it takes on its own life.” AI runs Monday through Wednesday at the Young Vic theater in London. Tickets are still available here.

{"type": "article", "header": "The Capital of China’s Xinjiang Region Is in Lockdown After a Deadly Blast", "author": "Emily Rauhala / Beijing", "update_date/publish_date": "May 22, 2014 2:29 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/108576/xiniiang-urumqi-bomb-uighur/", "text": "Urumqi does not want for cops. The capital of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, in China’s far northwest, is well-guarded. Riot trucks cruise city streets. Armed police stand vigil over Friday prayers. And following a deadly attack last month, the city’s railway station feels like a fortress. But none of this, it seems, has stopped the violence. At around 7:50 a.m. Thursday two “cross-country” vehicles collided on a street near Renmin Park, about 4km from the city’s main square, sending fire and smoke shooting into the sky, according to state media reports. Witnesses told local press they heard a series of explosions and saw blazing plumes stretching one-story high. Photographs from the scene show shattered market stalls, toppled piles of produce, and bodies lining the road. Police say at least 31 people were killed. The explosion hit the city at what is usually a quiet, restful time. China officially has one time zone, a fact that is at odds with longitudinal realities. To account for this, people in Xinjiang use both “Beijing time” and “Xinjiang time,” which is two hours behind. Ten to eight in the morning, Beijing time, is effectively 5:50 a.m. to the locals. At this hour, it’s usually only shopkeepers and the elderly who are milling about. The early-morning chaos comes just weeks after a brutal and bloody attack at an Urumqi railway station. On April 30, a bomb and knife attack at the city’s southern train terminal left three dead — two of them attackers — and 79 injured. Several people have since been arrested in connection with that attack. Although few details have been released, authorities say they were motivated by extremism. It will probably be days or weeks before we know what exactly happened. The authorities keep a tight lid on information about potentially sensitive subjects, and few subjects are more sensitive right now than the specter of unrest, or terrorism, in Xinjiang. The vast homeland of the Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim Uighur people has seen a rise in violence in recent years attributed, depending on who you ask, to religious extremism, separatism, or as a reaction to forceful religious and social oppression by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Many Uighurs feel overwhelmed by the pace of immigration to Xinjiang of China’s ethnic Han majority, with Urumqi now a majority Han city. For decades, a small minority has waged a campaign against the Chinese government, usually targeting symbols of state power in Xinjiang, including government buildings and police stations. The violence seems to be spreading. Last fall, a truck plowed through crowds of tourists in Beijing’s Tiananmen square, killing two and injuring dozens. Chinese authorities said the vehicle was driven by Uighur separatists, although few details have been released about the assailants — a man, his wife and his mother. In March, a group of knife-wielding attackers slashed and stabbed their way through a train station in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, killing 29. Chinese authorities identified the group as separatists from Xinjiang. All this has prompted the ruling Chinese Communist Party to tighten its already firm hold on the territory. In a visit to Xinjiang last month, President Xi Jinping promised a “strike first” policy and called police officers, who are disproportionately Han Chinese, the “fists and daggers” in the country’s fight against terrorism and separatism. “Sweat more in peacetime to bleed less in wartime,” he reportedly advised. By last weekend, the police were omnipresent. In Hotan, a dusty city in Xinjiang’s southwest, there were police trucks on each block of the city’s center. Roads to outlying towns and villages were blocked by checkpoints. In the otherwise laid-back and leafy capital, life continues apace, albeit in the presence of armed men. At Urumqi’s southern railway station — which is itself flanked by police stations — men with automatic weapons meet passengers at the ticket gate. The show of force is mighty, but on this awful morning, you have to wonder if anyone feels safe.

Two days later, we do not know who died, how they were killed or what sparked the violence. And with the area effectively sealed off by Chinese security forces, and the Internet up and down across the area, it is possible we never really will. Two vastly different accounts have emerged about the incident, which occurred on the first day of the ‘Id al-Fitr festival, which celebrates the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. Chinese state media reported that dozens of civilians were killed or injured in a premeditated terrorist attack in Shache county (or Yarkand in the Uighur language). The news, which was not released until more than 24 hours after the incident, was cast as evidence of organized terrorism by ethnic Uighur extremists. Their account suggests that knife-wielding mobs went on a rampage after officials discovered some explosives and foiled a terrorist plot that may or may not have been timed to coincide with a commodity fair. An account by the nonprofit Radio Free Asia (RFA) paints an altogether different picture. Reporters for the outlet’s Uighur-language news service say dozens of “knife- and ax-wielding” ethnic Uighurs were shot by police in a riot sparked by restrictions during Ramadan. “There has been a lot of pent-up frustration over house-to-house searches and checking on headscarves [worn by Uighur women] during this Ramadan,” Alim Adurshit, a local official, told RFA. The report also mentioned the extrajudicial killing of a Uighur family — an incident that has not been reported by Chinese state press and that TIME has not independently confirmed. The dueling narratives point to the challenge of figuring out what, exactly, is happening in China’s vast and restless northwest. The Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, where the incident took place, is contested space. It is both claimed as the homeland of the mostly Muslim, Turkic Uighur people, and also as Chinese territory. In recent years, the area has seethed with unrest attributed, depending on whom you ask, to Islamic terrorism, separatism or heavy-handed repression by the state. For years now, a small minority has fought against the government, usually by targeting symbols of state power, including police stations and transport hubs. The past year has been particularly bloody. In October, an SUV plowed through crowds of tourists in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, killing five — including three inside the vehicle — and injuring dozens. Chinese authorities said the vehicle was driven by ethnic Uighurs, but revealed little else. In March, a group of knife-wielding attackers slashed and stabbed their way through a train station in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, killing 29. The government blamed that incident, and two subsequent attacks in the regional capital, Urumqi, on separatists from Xinjiang. Beijing has responded by doubling down on already aggressive security measures and their campaign of forced cultural integration. Across the region, town squares are now patrolled by armed security personnel in riot gear, and villages are sealed off by police checkpoints. Ethnic Uighurs are stopped and searched. Meanwhile, the government has stepped up limits on religious practice by, for instance, putting age restrictions on mosque visits and banning students and government workers from fasting during Ramadan. In the context of this division and distrust, it makes sense that there are competing claims. The trouble is, China prevents outsiders from gathering information on their own. The foreign press corps is, by virtue of China’s rules, based far from Xinjiang, primarily in the Han-majority cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Travel to Xinjiang, while not officially forbidden, is effectively restricted. When I visited Urumqi and Hotan in late May, security personnel harassed my Chinese colleague, questioned me, followed our movements and stopped us from traveling to the city of Kashgar. The ruling Communist Party’s powers of information control are also a factor. On a good day, China’s Great Firewall makes it difficult for citizens to share information that censors might consider politically sensitive; other days, it is impossible. Following the violent suppression of the 2009 riots in Urumqi, the government effectively turned off the region’s Internet for nine months. There are reports the web is off and on again now, which may help explain why so little has emerged in terms of firsthand accounts or photographic evidence. Overseas-based Uighur groups say until there is transparency, the public should not trust the state’s account. “China does not want the world to know what occurred on Monday,” said Alim Seytoff, president of the Uyghur American Association, in a statement. “As little is known of the circumstances of their killing, due to tight restrictions on information, UAA seeks an open investigation into the incident and the loss of dozens of lives.” With every instance of violence, that looks less likely to happen.

But the retail giant slipped a bit Thursday, when it announced that its fourth-quarter profit fell short of Wall Street’s expectations, and the stock tumbled as much as 10% in after-hours trading. Perhaps in anticipation that investors would be disappointed by its profits and outlook going forward, Amazon CFO Thomas J. Szkutak told analysts that the company was considering raising the price of its popular Amazon Prime service by anywhere from $20 to $40. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster told the Wall Street Journal that it could drive $475 million in new revenue for Amazon, based on his estimate that the service has 18.7 million users. But is this price raise short-sighted? The Prime Membership program, after all, isn’t supposed to be about revenue in and of itself. It’s more like a rewards program that convinces customers to do all sorts of shopping on the website, from big ticket electronics to everyday items like toothpaste and tissue paper. “I was a little surprised by it,” says R.J. Hottovy, analyst with Morningstar who covers Amazon. “I thought that’s been a price point that’s worked for them for some time.” In a report issued last year, Hottovy explained how even with the high shipping costs that come with free, two-day shipping, Amazon Prime was a profitable program for the company because it attracted high-value customers who spend big (and do so often) on the site. So why mess with a profitable program that is one of the main drivers of Amazon’s massive growth? At some point Amazon is going to have to increase its margins. It can’t just go on being barely profitable forever, and investors are going to at some point demand earnings that warrant the company’s sky-high valuation. Though Hottovy was surprised by the timing of the move, he does think that raising the price of Amazon Prime is preferable to raising prices more broadly. “Today’s consumer has just gotten so savvy when it comes to online shopping,” he says. “You have to maintain the perception of low-cost products, and raising the price of a one-time charge of a Prime membership has less impact psychologically.” The move could also be an attempt to create more of a tiered pricing for the Prime program. Amazon already lures many new Prime members through its lower-cost student program, which costs just $39 per year, and offers a free month of Amazon Prime to those who purchase new Kindle Fire tablets. It’s possible that the move to raise prices on Prime membership will come in concert with more offers like these, which will enable Amazon to raise prices on less price-sensitive shoppers, while still attracting more discerning, newer customers. Still, you have to wonder why Amazon wants to raise prices at all. Though Amazon doesn’t divulge Prime membership figures, Hottovy estimates that it doubled its membership in 2013 and that Amazon Prime could have north of 20 million subscribers. Those kind of numbers don’t scream “broken program,” he says. Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.11256060606060606, "subjectivity_score": 0.45436174242424243},

Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch in the film, is credited as the father of computer science. He cracked codes produced by the German military’s seemingly unbreakable Enigma machine during World War II using math, engineering and still-to-be-invented computer science. But most of the documents tracing his work for the British government have been destroyed and little is known about Turing’s personal life. Here’s what is likely truth and what is embellishment in The Imitation Game based on Alan Turing: The Enigma and the Turing Exhibition at London’s Science Museum. Alan Turing’s first love, Christopher, died at a young age Ruling: Fact Christopher, an older student at Sherborne School in Dorset, was also interested in math. Turing harbored feelings toward Christopher, though Turing believed his love was not reciprocated. In the movie, Turing learns of Christopher’s death after-the-fact from his headmaster. In reality, Turing had been told his friend was sick and to prepare for the worst before Christopher passed. Christopher’s death did spur Turing to pursue mathematics in the hope that he could understand whether part of Christopher could somehow live on without his body. In the year after his death, Turing wrote an essay in which he discussed how the soul might survive after death with a nod to the new field of quantum mechanics. Alan Turing was a closeted gay man Ruling: Fact Alan Turing was gay at a time when homesexual activity was outlawed in England. In 1952, he was convicted of “gross indecency.” (He admitted to being gay but pled not guilty because he thought the law was unjust.) He was sentenced to probation that involved chemical castration (see more below) and committed suicide within two years with cyanide. The filmmakers decided not to include the suicide in the movie even though they filmed the scene. Benedict Cumberbatch explained to the press at New York City’s 92Y that in the film’s last scene, “Someone [is] telling [Turing] something he never had told to him in his life: That he did matter — the fact that he was regarded as different and not normal was hugely important to the world and to everybody around him. No one had told him that in his life. So to end it on that note, with someone explaining, was our way of thanking him in the structure of the film, our eulogy to him.” Joan Clarke is invited to Bletchley Park, the home of the government’s code breaking operation, after completing a crossword puzzle Ruling: Fiction Clarke’s professor at Oxford helped her get into the program (which was dominated by men). The crossword puzzle test scene is fictionalized, though that was a method the government did use to recruit code-crackers at the time. Joan’s parents didn’t want her at Bletchley Ruling: Fiction In the movie, the Clarkes do not want their daughter to crack codes for the government because she is a woman, but that aspect of the film was added for dramatic tension. Turing named the code breaking machine “Christopher” Ruling: Fiction In the film, Turing tells Clarke that he named the machine “Christopher.” (The audience knows it’s named after Turing’s first love, though Clarke doesn’t know that part.) Turing is obsessed with the idea of using a computer to engineer a human brain or even a soul, and dubbing the computer “Christopher” makes it seem as if Turing may be trying to find a way to resurrect his old love. In reality, the machine was called the Bombe and nicknamed “Victory.” John Cairncross threatens to expose Turing’s sexuality if Turing reveals he’s a spy Ruling: Fiction In the film, Cairncross says he will tell the government Turing’s secret sexuality if Turing reveals that Caincross is a spy. The blackmail works for a while and Turing covers up for Cairnscross. In fact, the two never met. Though Cairncross was at Bletchley Park, he did not work with Turing. There were strict separations between the units. As far as historians can tell, Turing never hid spies from the government. Turing asked Clarke to marry him Ruling: Fact Turing and Clarke were indeed engaged for a time. And, like in the movie, they never went through with the marriage. Turing revealed his true sexuality to his fiancée and, according to Turing, Clarke was “unfazed” by the revelation. Some critics have said the friendship and pseudo-romance between Turing and Clarke is overblown in the film. Keira Knightley, who plays Clarke, told the Huffington Post, “I think what we’re trying to get to is the essence of what it was. And at that time with Alan, to my knowledge, he didn’t have another affair, or an affair actually, with a man. His big friendship was with a woman and he did ask her to marry him.” MORE: The History Behind Benedict Cumberbatch’s The Imitation Game The government thought Turing might be a Soviet spy Ruling: Fiction In the film, an officer interrogates Turing thinking he’s a spy and accidentally uncovers Turing’s sexuality. In reality, Turing was investigated for “gross indecency” after he reported a petty theft to the police. In his report, he concealed the fact that he was in a relationship with the possible thief. After the police pursued the charge, Turing finally submitted a five-page report admitting to his affair with a man. Turing underwent chemical castration after his conviction Ruling: Fact Consensual sex between two men remained illegal until 1967 in England. To avoid prison, Turing accepted treatment with estrogen, chemical castration meant to neutralize his libido. Gay men were considered a security risk to the government because they were open to blackmail, so Turing lost his security clearance. Turing died on June 7, 1954. He was found with a partly-eaten apple, and many biographers have posited it was laced with cyanide. But the autopsy found four ounces of cyanide in Turing’s stomach, suggesting he drank the poison and ate the apple to make the experience more palatable. Some have suggested Apple’s symbol, the apple, is a tribute to Turing, though Steve Jobs denied this connection on multiple occasions.

The 22 million individuals and counting who have already handed over their images to the Lensa application might be fine to receive the myriad of AI-illustrated images in exchange for their data. But the fundamental rights, principles, and freedoms users are giving up during this exchange remains largely unchecked. In Web3 technology circles, much promises have been made of decentralized technologies to open up the possibility for individual ownership and monetization of data, returning power to “creators.” This reflects the political ethos held by Blockchain proponents like Etherum co-founder Joe Lubin, who ostensibly seek to supplant the existing power structures of finance through “permissionless” consensus-based transaction data structures. In both cases, this isn’t a problem that can be solved by technology or the rhetoric of “algorithmic governance.” Instead, it requires addressing fundamental rights that precede capitalist exchanges. In the case of digital art and data ownership, the problem won’t be solved by new tech, but by better articulation of what rights individuals have to assert: what information is collected about them, how it’s used, with whom it’s shared, and for what purposes. Research has shown that, by and large, individuals have little conception of the value that is generated from their data by companies, or how much data is collected. They often seem, on the surface, willing to make a bargain to share data in exchange for a service or product. In the case of the Lensa application, individuals uploaded over 10-20 personal images in exchange for a series of AI portraits, while their biometric data and likeness is being accessed, stored, or monetized not just at this present moment, but also for the future. (Lensa recently updated it’s privacy policy amidst concerns of how user data might be retained. It is worth noting that, in the U.S., only California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia currently have comprehensive privacy laws). Read More: Why It’s So Hard to Resist Turning Your Selfies Into Lensa AI Art What researchers have framed as a kind of “digital resignation” has taken hold of technology consumers, who see no way to opt-out of a powerful system that collects and monetizes people’s data and interactions. The relative newness of AI technology, social media, and the internet gives the impression that what we are encountering is a fundamentally different problem from what we’ve seen before. That perception is intensified by the “information asymmetries” between technology companies and their customers, which obscure how much data is collected and used, and how valuable it is. But if you approach data ownership as a proxy for certain access, usage, and control rights, then historical corollaries of how such rights have been dealt with in relation to other valuable resources provide frameworks for the current debate. Where control of a resource has been deemed of substantial interest to a society, government control and ownership has been implemented in the form of state-owned enterprises. The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in India & The Australian National Broadband Network are two examples. In the case of state ownership of data, China is a prime example: Beijing recently passed the 2021 Personal Information Protection Law effectively granting state control of data stored anywhere in the country. In fact, the concept of data as a national resource is now cropping up amongst policy makers around the world. Historically, when a resource has stood to generate tremendous wealth but also had the potential for catastrophic social and personal harms, “public trusts” have been instituted as a form of collective ownership. A commons approach renders the resource public, and law and custom function to limit uses. U.S. environmental trusts and protections of national lands and Norway’s collectively owned petroleum reserves are two examples of this. The U.S. has established data commons around publicly funded areas of research, like The National Cancer Institute’s Data Commons. Frameworks for collective versus individual property rights don’t just specify who the owner is—they also distinguish between who is answerable to certain claims, like access rights. Different types of property ownership reflect different goals and principles that guide governance, whether the point of property is access for everyone, preservation, or collective governance, itself. An approach that seems more aligned with where the goals of current Web3 efforts eventually leads, is one of private ownership rights. Contemporary notions of private property stem from 17th-century philosopher John Locke’s theory of homesteading, which argued that ownership arises from mixing one’s labor with the natural world in order to create private property. That is, more or less, how tech companies make their case that when they take our data and turn it into something of value in the market: They own it. Of course, like in the case of much of the art criticized to create AI-generated portraits, there are valid questions around both creative labor and existing legal copyrights. Given that the value reaped from most data sets is only realized once they become relational, aggregate, and economies of scale are reached—and that it’s exceedingly difficult to determine the “creator” of most data—it’s worth asking whether ownership is actually fundamental to assert control of one’s data. Whether data ownership is structured as private, common, or national, ultimately, there are historically fundamental rights that precede economic ownership, entirely. For example, the right to privacy is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Recently, there have been successful efforts within the European Union to articulate a rights-based approach to limit uses of data—notably with the General Data Protection (GDPR) legislation, which restricts aggregation and trade in personal data. Under GDPR, individuals have rights to data access, data erasure, and data portability, all of which are grounded and built upon a legal framework of fundamental human rights. As data continues to be produced on an unprecedented scale thanks to expanded use of sensors, wearables, AI, and connected devices, calling for data ownership is an underspecified demand. The better question for those concerned about the intrusive power of technology companies is not who owns data, but rather, what are the appropriate public uses of private data and what is the best way to facilitate these uses that adequately protects individuals’ rights? Those calling for data ownership would be better off forgoing the language of ownership entirely, and instead making explicit that they are concerned with certain rights. Ultimately, while arguments calling for ownership may be appealing, it’s critical to remember that primary rights are human rights—not the rights conferred by corporations and capitalism.

These AI-generated images are the product of digital editing app Lensa’s new “Magic Avatars” feature, a tool that uses machine learning to create stylized portraits based on photos provided by users. Lensa has been around since 2018, but started skyrocketing in popularity when Magic Avatars launched in late November. The app saw around 13.5 million worldwide installs in the first 12 days of December, more than six times the 2 million it saw in November, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. Consumers also spent approximately $29.3 million in the app during that 12-day period, Sensor Towers reports. Lensa’s digital illustrations have clearly struck a chord with people. But what is it about this AI tech that has users so hooked? When you download Lensa, you get a seven-day free trial and then have the option of paying a one-time fee for a specific number of unique avatars ($3.99 for 50 is the cheapest option) or shelling out $35.99 for an annual subscription and unlimited avatars. The app then uses an open-source neural network model called Stable Diffusion that’s “trained on a sizable set of internet data to generate images from…small pieces of text describing the desired scene in the output image,” according to Prisma Labs, the company behind Lensa. Basically, it uses AI technology to render photos into artwork based on text prompts. With Magic Avatars, these prompts are categories like cosmic, fantasy, and pop. While there are layers to Lensa’s appeal, there’s likely a vanity factor in play, says Nick Yee, a social scientist who has been researching self-representation and social interaction in gaming and virtual worlds for over two decades. It’s no secret that people like to see pictures of themselves looking good. But, experts note, Lensa’s appeal shines a spotlight on just how complicated the idea of “looking good” can be. “A lot of these apps are trained on models who are ‘attractive,’ who have slimmer bodies, who conform to ideals of beauty in our culture,” he says. “So sure, Magic Avatars is putting your photo in these fantastic scenarios and dressing up your portrait. But along the way, it’s also making a photo of you more ‘attractive.’ That’s something a lot of people pick up on when they see their friends try it out.” Some people do get a short-term confidence boost from seeing themselves that way, says Rabindra Ratan, an associate professor at Michigan State University’s Department of Media and Information who researches the effects of human-technology interaction. “What we consistently find is that a small boost in ‘attractiveness’ in your avatar is good for your confidence,” he says. “It doesn’t make you feel deceptive. It makes you feel like your good traits are just a tad bit magnified.” But there’s also a flip side to this effect. “If that boost is too great, then it’s harmful and problematic for a host of reasons,” Ratan says. In addition to reigniting debate over the ethics of AI art and data-privacy issues, Lensa has sparked controversy over how its “magic” AI portraits depict women and people of color. “One common critique I hear is that the app typically makes you look younger and makes you look thinner and makes your skin whiter,” Yee says. “And depending on your face, some of those effects could be exaggerated to the point where it becomes unrealistic and you get this backlash effect of, ‘This is clearly not me.'” In an FAQ addressing questions and concerns that have been raised about its tech, Prisma said Lensa’s model was “trained on unfiltered Internet content. So it reflects the biases humans incorporate into the images they produce. Creators acknowledge the possibility of societal biases. So do we.” So, depending how close your face is to the average in the trained model, people can come away from using the app experiencing very different psychological effects, Yee says. “For people who are Caucasian, who are younger, and who are similar to the model’s trained norms, you’re more likely to get that confidence boost because the output is close to what you look like; there’s a strong resemblance, but there are improvements,” he says. “Whereas if you’re an ethnic minority, you have an atypical facial structure, you’re older, or your skin is darker, you’re more likely to get those backlash effects.” Write to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/6240981/social-media-addiction-app/", "https://time.com/6238781/chatbot-chatgpt-ai-interview/", "https://time.com/6215340/edit-tweets-imessages-consequences/"], "sentiment_score": 0.1613104731525784, "subjectivity_score": 0.5537737019315966},

He’s a Hong Kong kid and that’s why, just before midnight on Oct. 6, he and his girlfriend (and his girlfriend’s friend, because teenagers travel in packs) have ducked into a barbecue joint in the working-class neighborhood of Mongkok to feast on grilled scallions, roasted pineapple and Chinese egg noodles bathed in cheese and garlic—a classic Hong Kong fusion dish. Wong, who turns 18 this month, sucks down the pasta with one hand and checks his smartphone with the other. Slurp, swipe, slurp, swipe. The clatter of Cantonese rattles around the restaurant. An overhead TV displays images of the student-led protest movement that has occupied key commercial districts of Hong Kong, highlighting the dilemma of a hybrid city reared on democratic ideals but ruled by an authoritarian China. No one in the eatery, though, pays much attention to the news. This kind of place—fluorescent-lit, Formica-clad, Hong Kong soul food of the cheesiest, noodliest variety—is why Wong, one of the organizers of the protest campaign, says he will never leave his home city, why he, like Peter Pan, never wants to become that most disdainful of species: an adult. “The future will not be decided by adults,” says Wong. “I would like to ask adults, people with capital and power, Why are they not fighting for democracy?” (PHOTOS: A New Generation Speaks: See Inside Hong Kong’s Protests) If Wong is wary of adulthood, his beloved home, Hong Kong, is also suspended in adolescence. The city may be the financial heart of the world’s most dynamic region, a collection of 7.2 million people for whom pragmatism and efficiency are a guiding faith. But since its inception as a tiny fishing port plundered by the British from the enfeebled Qing dynasty in the mid–19th century, to the colony’s hand­over back to China in 1997, Hong Kong has never been permitted political maturity. It was always a pawn of empire. When Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty, the former Crown Colony was given a 50-year adjustment period to mainland rule. The “one country, two systems” policy guaranteed the territory a “high degree of autonomy” from Beijing on most everything but security matters. In 33 years’ time, though, the city will revert to full Chinese governance. Little Hong Kong will be forced to grow up and merge with the masses. The trajectory toward 2047 is particularly troubling for Hong Kong youth, who will inherit this new political reality. Already, many locals worry that China’s communist rulers are eroding the freedoms—like an independent judiciary and an open press—that differentiate the city from the rest of China. Beijing’s recently announced plan to prevent Hong Kong from freely electing its chief executive galvanized the first batch of protesters who crowded the city’s downtown in late September. But it was the overreaction to this display of civil disobedience—sprays of tear gas from the police and outright thuggery from elements of Hong Kong’s underworld—that led tens of thousands to occupy more streets, a spontaneous, sympathetic outpouring no one, least of all Wong, expected. Umbrellas, unfurled by students against the pepper spray, turned into the movement’s symbol. Hong Kong’s very public struggle now ranks as China’s most consequential protest since the 1989 pro-democracy rallies were crushed at Tiananmen—and young Hong Kong residents have provided the crusade with both its population and its passion. The student-led siege of prime Hong Kong property is not going to suddenly transform the territory into a full-fledged democracy—certainly not if the Chinese Communist Party remains in power on the mainland. As a government ultimatum to clear the streets expired without incident on Oct. 6, the urge for solidarity against the authorities faded; protest numbers have waned. Nevertheless, the events of the past few weeks have awakened a political consciousness that few, even in the city itself, knew they possessed. Their idealism, not to mention their organizational acumen and communal spirit, is exactly what threatens China’s rulers, who, from the heady days of Tiananmen and further back in the country’s history, know well the transformative potential of students on the streets. Teen Icon It was past 1 a.m. on Oct. 2, and the throngs gathered outside Hong Kong’s government headquarters in Admiralty district were starting to dissipate. Protesters had spent days camped on an overpass, sleeping curled around their backpacks, subsisting on crackers and KFC. Throughout the campaign, some had been pepper-sprayed and soaked by rain. The air was growing thick again, and restlessness had set in. As a light mist fell, word spread: Joshua Wong—who on Sept. 26 was arrested for trespassing and spent 46 hours in detention for the students’ initial occupation—was about to speak. Many in the crowd raised their phones to capture the moment. With his bowl-cut bangs, sparse stubble and thick-framed spectacles, Wong looks like any other nerdy kid in a society where nearly half of youngsters wear glasses. His delivery at the makeshift podium set in the shelter of a pedestrian bridge came in confident, quick-fire Cantonese. The fight for full democracy is not over, he told protesters. “Stay,” he said. They did. Off the podium, Wong is polite, prone to bringing his hands together in a penitent clasp. He was raised in a Christian family that dispatched him to rural China for volunteer teaching; some of his fellow student activists are friends from church. In 2011, when he was just 14 years old, Wong formed a group of students in Hong Kong called Scholarism to stop the territory from implementing a mainland-designed “national education” policy that ignored the Tiananmen massacre and pushed fealty to the Chinese Communist Party. After 100,000 people joined his 2012 street rally, the Hong Kong government backed off. Wong had taken on Hong Kong’s bosses in Beijing—and notched a rare victory. Local celebrity followed, with breaking-news reports on his (mediocre) college-entrance examination results. Despite the attention usually reserved for Canto-pop heartthrobs, Wong lacks physical presence. His shoulders are hunched in the kind of phone-tethered posture that annoys mothers everywhere. Yet his rhetoric, often delivered with eyes squeezed shut, is unequivocal. “I don’t want to follow the games of adults,” he says, “handing out business cards that you’ll just put in the rubbish bin, chit-chat. Political reform is not going to come from going to meetings … We had to do radical action because our leaders did nothing.” Wong has a girlfriend named Tiffany and thumbs picked raw from stress. He wishes he had more time to play mobile-phone games and displays no overriding affection for any particular book. Despite the command his speeches claim over the protesters, Wong says he has no wish to serve as an icon and is still shocked that his arrest last month galvanized so many to join the cause. He doesn’t have any heroes himself, neither Mahatma Gandhi nor Wang Dan, the Beijing university student whose leadership of the Tiananmen pro-democracy struggle made him “enemy No. 1” to the Chinese government. To Wong, the leaderless nature of the territory’s democracy movement is a strength, not a weakness. “If Hong Kong just relies on me,” he says, “the movement will fail.” Generation Gap Compared with their peers in mainland China, Hong Kong’s youth are wealthier, healthier and have access to social media like Facebook and Twitter that are blocked by Chinese censors. Wong is often asked if his parents are activists; they are not. There’s an assumption there must be something unusual about his upbringing, beyond his Protestant faith, that makes him care. “People think that every night we were talking about how the government was violating democratic principles,” he says. “[My parents] just gave me the freedom to do what I want.” Such liberty in China is unique to Hong Kong, and the city’s prospects depend on the whims of a Communist Party led by a President, Xi Jinping, who has shown little tolerance for dissent. Even the local economy is not immune to jitters about the future, especially as worries proliferate that Hong Kong’s reputation for clean governance is being compromised by Communist Party politics. Hong Kong has long thrived as a conduit for foreign investors to China, but growth is slowing, chiefly because of sliding exports. “If Hong Kong is so obviously becoming just another mainland city, why not set up one’s regional headquarters in Beijing or Shanghai?” asks Carsten Holz, an economics professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Income inequality has surged since 1997 and now ranks as the highest in the developed world. The fertility rate is so low that the local population cannot sustain itself. Instead, an influx of mainland Chinese—40.7 million visited last year—has brought with it a flood of new wealth that has made Hong Kong’s homes the least affordable in the world, yet also the smallest, according to one housing survey. “We don’t see good prospects for our future,” says Katie Lo, 21, a university student. Proud of their heritage—the Cantonese language instead of the Mandarin spoken on the mainland, for instance—locals fear a cultural and economic invasion from the north. “Stand on Canton Road,” frets legislator Claudia Mo, speaking of a major Hong Kong thoroughfare, “and you’ll hardly hear any Cantonese.” Mandarin has eclipsed English as the city’s second language. For her own part, Mo speaks very upper-class British English. She comes from a coastal mainland Chinese family that fled the communists and came to Hong Kong. But like many of her peers, she identifies as a Hong Konger first, global citizen second and a resident of the People’s Republic a distant third. There’s plenty of chauvinism toward mainlanders in Hong Kong. A nasty local phrase labels them “locusts.” For all the hope that Hong Kong’s struggle might catalyze a similar awakening in the rest of China, where dissent usually earns activists jail terms, many Hong Kong students’ concerns are locally cocooned. “Hong Kong people want to protect our freedoms,” says Hiu Wah, a 19-year-old early-childhood education student. “I am not interested in changing Chinese politics.” While Britain extended rule of law to its colony, it kept the populace all but disenfranchised. Since the 1997 handover, China has provided the territory with a string of proxies for its chief executive, the latest being the widely unpopular Leung Chun-ying. Hong Kong still boasts competent civil servants and veteran democracy legislators, with their crisp British accents and posh overseas degrees. But the youth at the barricades defending the protest sites wonder what all that conventional activism has done to change Hong Kong’s political predicament. “People always say to me, ‘Oh, if you want to change the world, first you need to go to university, then work as a government administrator or a businessman, then you can make policies,’” says Wong. “No, to affect the world, you go to the streets.” Backlash Movements need great men and women, and practical ones too. Already the protests have lost momentum, as the crowds thin. By the night of Oct. 7, no more than a couple thousand people milled around the main occupied zone in Admiralty district, well below the tens of thousands days earlier. So much energy has gone into figuring out how to get the protesters off the streets—endless talk about talking with the government, in addition to the actual talking—rather than figuring out how to turn this movement into practical policy that Beijing might consider. The protest leaders have declined to invite opposition politicians, who are well practiced at negotiating with the central government, into their movement. The same organizational and factional dysfunction that has beset protest movements around the world may undercut the Hong Kong campaign too. “They want to do it on their own,” says Emily Lau, head of the Democratic Party. “But why alienate pan-democrat legislators? Our goals are the same.” Even for Hong Kong residents who support the students’ ideals, the lengthy shutdown of major roads and neighborhoods is a significant inconvenience. Paul Zimmerman, a district councillor who pointedly carried an umbrella to an official ceremony marking China’s National Day on Oct. 1, says it’s time to withdraw. “You’ve given people a voice,” he says, “now you give them the street back.” Wong isn’t bothered. “You need to create the rules yourself,” he says. “Students have more time, more energy, so they should stand on the front lines.” Whenever Wong is spotted shuffling through any of the protest sites, he’s mobbed by dozens of news cameras and fans requesting snapshots with him. Hollywood actors might be used to the attention, but Wong is a student who, as he likes to point out, attends the ninth-ranked of nine universities in Hong Kong. (He is studying politics and public administration.) The attention, all those demands to explain his political philosophy and smile for selfies, is exhausting. No wonder Wong is sometimes most comfortable going underground, literally. As he hops onto the subway, almost no one recognizes him. He’s just another teenager, swaying as the train tunnels under Hong Kong’s harbor, updating his Facebook page and WhatsApping madly. Three friends, also in Scholarism, stand next to him, absorbed in their own online lives. Barely a few seconds go by without frantic swiping. “Taking action is more meaningful than words,” says Wong. He dismisses planned negotiations with the authorities as “just an opportunity to show our anger to the government.” Inevitably, his head soon bends over his phone again, just a lone Hong Kong kid connecting with the world. — With reporting by Elizabeth Barber, Rishi Iyengar, Nash Jenkins and David Stout / Hong Kong Write to Emily Rauhala / Hong Kong at emily_rauhala@timeasia.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.07418846156814073, "subjectivity_score": 0.35948697173296107},

A 25-year-old tech executive’s eyes filled with tears, and he clenched his jaw. Rumors, they said, had mysterious men in black shirts amassing in a restaurant in the Wanchai district, just down the deserted avenue from the roadblocks that members of Hong Kong’s protest movement had set up more than a week before. The stretch on Queensway, in the shadow of government offices, the High Court, and a shopping mall, was empty save the few jittery barricade defenders and a fellow protester who snoozed on a wooden plank. Two of the men had wrapped their hands in towels they hoped might protect their knuckles from whatever violence might come their way. “We don’t know what will happen,” said the 25-year-old, peering east into the dark toward Wanchai. “But we are scared.” The men in black shirts did not materialize. Nor did the police. Despite a vow from Hong Kong’s top leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, to clear major streets for the beginning of the workweek, the Hong Kong protest movement still occupies major commercial areas in the Asian financial capital. By daybreak on Monday, the number of journalists and protest tourists prowling the main demonstration site in Admiralty almost outnumbered the remaining protesters. Still, the barricades, set up to defend a movement demanding democratic commitments from the Chinese central government, held. “I choose to stand up,” says Jennifer Wong, a 17-year-old high school student from the New Territories, near the border with mainland China. “Maybe [the movement] will not work in the end, but we will regret it if we don’t try.” Protest leaders, from the three main groups that had banded together to establish this democratic crusade 10 days ago, strategized throughout Sunday as Leung’s ultimatum to disperse loomed. Powwows took place in the quiet halls of the Legislative Council building, where two of the protest blocs had set up makeshift command headquarters. But it was not clear who had the authority to negotiate on behalf of the protesters (or wanted to exercise that power), nor was it apparent who formally represented the government’s side. “The beauty of the movement is that there is no leader,” said one adviser to the Occupy Central group, which kick-started the peaceful siege that has drawn tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents, many of them young and middle class. “But that’s also its flaw.” Outside the Legco building, dozens of protesters tended to their encampments, accepting donations of drinking water or adjusting pieces of cardboard that served as both bedroom and living room. Some had been there since the beginning and had clear demands: the resignation of Chief Executive Leung, who is considered the central government’s proxy in Hong Kong, and a rollback of Beijing’s plan to prevent the territory’s voters from directly electing their leader in 2017. Others had joined the protest movement later, shocked into action by the aggressive tactics that had been used to try to break up the rallies, including police tear gas and thuggery from elements linked to Hong Kong’s triad mafia. It’s clear that the protesters are joined in their anger toward Beijing, which they feel is degrading the liberties that make Hong Kong a unique city in China, such as an independent judiciary and media. (When the former British colony was returned to China in 1997, the outpost was promised a high degree of autonomy for 50 years under a formulation called “one country, two systems.”) For the demonstrators, Leung is also a vilified character, maligned as much for his Beijing yes-man reputation as for the decision to unleash tear gas and pepper spray on the protesters on Sept. 28. But unity of message doesn’t necessarily mean that the protesters are falling in line behind a certain individual who can carry the movement forward. “We all want the same thing,” says Daisy Lee, a 33-year-old clerk. “But we’re not here because we support one person or one group.” Lee worries that the diffuse nature of the rallies could undercut their ultimate effectiveness. “I’ve spent so many hours here,” she says. “But none of the so-called trio of groups has come to talk to us. Are they communicating with each other? We don’t know. We need strong leadership.” Already, certain demands from protest leaders have gone unheeded by the rank and file, like a call from student activists to consolidate and abandon a satellite protest site across Victoria Harbour. On Sunday afternoon, a message went out from the Occupy group announcing that protesters had pulled back from a picket at the entrance to the chief executive’s office. But as night fell, students and other youth, surrounded by the inevitable journalist hordes, maintained their vigil at that precise point. On Monday morning, the diehards that remained stood by as civil servants trooped in to work. Crisis had been averted and ultimatums or conditions from both sides were politely ignored. Throughout Monday, more talks were to take place between the myriad players in this unlikely movement. From a scorecard perspective, the protesters had prevailed the night before by peacefully defying the government’s order to cease and desist. But it’s still hard to see what significant political concessions they can wrest from Beijing, which has been churning out articles and cartoons in the state-run media both deriding and assailing their civil disobedience. Conciliatory moves by Chinese President Xi Jinping could make his administration look weak, and he has not given the impression of a leader enamored by the art of compromise. As the workweek began in Hong Kong and traffic snarled because of the protest roadblocks, patience from a sector of ordinary citizens may wear thin. Already, some Hong Kong residents were quietly criticizing the continuing shutdown of major business and tourist areas. “Of course I support more democracy for Hong Kong and am not opposed to [the protesters’] ideals,” said a woman surnamed Liu, who came with her 11-year-old son to look at the occupied site in Mongkok district. “But we need to eat, to do business. How can we do that when they take over the streets?” Whatever happens, Hong Kong’s political consciousness has been awakened. Emily Lau, a veteran local legislator, jokes that she’s been labeled “a head-banger” for her decades of pro-democracy work. “It’s very invigorating to have such a spontaneous, peaceful movement full of young people,” she says. “Once people have been shown their power they will know how to use it again and again.” Lau could well be talking about Tanson Tsui, a high school student with a backpack full of English homework who was camped out at the entrance to the chief executive’s office on Sunday night. Tsui was born in 1997, the year the British handed Hong Kong back to China. “I came here because of myself,” he said. “I am not following anyone, I have no leader. I will fight to the end because I am Hong Kongese and I have to protect my home.” — With reporting by Zoher Abdoolcarim / Hong Kong — Video by Helen Regan / Hong Kong Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.039934809859052296, "subjectivity_score": 0.3963850991881294},

Speaking at a press conference in Beijing on Tuesday, Wang also said that one of the missing individuals, 65-year-old British citizen Lee Bo, was “first and foremost a Chinese citizen.” U.K. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond shared the podium with Wang at the press conference, and expressed “deep concern” over Lee’s disappearance, the South China Morning Post reports. Lee is the latest member of Mighty Current Media — which specializes in popular but lurid and reportedly defamatory works on Chinese Communist Party officials — to have vanished since the company’s owner failed to return from a holiday in Thailand last October. The company’s general manager and two other staff members are also missing. It is being widely speculated in Hong Kong that Lee has been abducted by mainland Chinese agents. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported that he faxed a message to a colleague saying that he had made “his own way” to China to take part in an unspecified investigation and that it would be “some time.” There is no official record of him leaving the city, but his wife Sophie Choi verified the handwriting on the fax as her husband’s, the Post says. If Lee has been taken to the mainland, his case would constitute a flagrant and unprecedented breach of the autonomy that Beijing promised Hong Kong upon the former British colony’s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The case has caused deep alarm in a city where, unlike other parts of China, freedom of expression and the rule of law are cherished rights.

The territory’s most senior official, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, said Monday that he was extremely concerned over the bookseller’s fate and stressed that mainland police did not have the authority to act in Hong Kong. According to the South China Morning Post, the wife of 65-year-old Lee Bo said that she had received a call from him after he went missing last week. He told her that he was in the Chinese border city of Shenzhen, “assisting” mainland police in an investigation into four of his colleagues, who have also gone missing. There is, however, no official record of Lee leaving Hong Kong. If his story is verified, it would represent a flagrant breach — if not the de facto ending — of the legal autonomy granted to Hong Kong by China in 1997, when the former British colony was returned to Chinese sovereignty. It would also send a stark warning to the city’s dissidents that Hong Kong jurisdiction is no longer any guarantee of protection. Lee, and four other colleagues who have also vanished, worked at the Sage bookstore, which specialized in racy works highly critical of the Chinese Communist Party and senior party officials. Sage’s catalog, which boasts bold titles like The Collapse of Xi Jinping in 2017, is often sordid in its subject matter and lurid in its prose.

In the Bessemer, Alabama warehouse, 1,798 employees voted to oppose unionization through the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), and just 738 voted in favor of it. (Roughly 500 contested ballots were not counted, but they would not have changed the outcome.) The battle isn’t over. The RWDSU has already announced it is submitting objections to Amazon’s conduct to the NLRB, alleging that Amazon “interfered with the right of its Bessemer, Alabama employees to vote in a free and fair election.” The regional NLRB office will investigate the claims and decide whether they require a hearing. Either party could then still file an appeal with the national NLRB office, spurring a protracted battle that might not produce a definitive outcome for months. But whatever the ultimate result, the large number of workers who voted against unionizing in the initial count signifies the sheer power and resources that Amazon can leverage to win labor battles—and the relatively low risk large companies face in pushing the boundaries in these fights. While more than 3,000 workers signed cards indicating support for the RWDSU representing them last fall, Amazon spent months unleashing a slew of controversial tactics that some labor activists argue were designed to suppress union support before the seven-week voting period began. (An unknown number of those 3,000-plus employees who indicated initial support have since left the company.) The downward trend in support for the union between the petitioning stage and the actual vote count is common in union fights against powerful companies, says Mark Gaston Pearce, a visiting professor and executive director of the Workers’ Rights Institute at Georgetown University Law Center and former chair of the National Labor Relations Board under the Obama Administration. “Oftentimes unions start out with a majority of support,” he says. “And then when the employer starts working over the employees, you have a loss of support, either through coercion or through fear or other means.” Whether Amazon did coerce employees is for the NLRB to decide. But the company has enormous power at its disposal to fight against unionization: It is one of the world’s largest publicly traded companies, was founded by the world’s richest man, Jeff Bezos, and boasts a $1.7 trillion market cap. In the run-up to the unionization voting period that began in February, Amazon mandated employees attend anti-union meetings; created a website warning workers about perceived pitfalls of unionizing, including the expense of dues that workers in right-to-work states like Alabama are not obligated to pay; hung fliers discouraging workers from unionizing around the plant, including in the bathroom stalls; and, according to emails obtained by the labor movement media group More Perfect Union, pressured the United States Postal Service—which counts Amazon as one of its largest customers—to install a ballot drop box outside the plant, despite an NLRB ruling that such a setup might imply “a problematic amount of Employer involvement in election proceedings.” (In a statement to the Washington Post, an Amazon spokesperson said the mailbox was intended to make it easy for employees to vote and only the USPS had access to it.) The RWDSU says some of these tactics violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which forbids employers from restraining or coercing employees from engaging in union activity. “Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees. We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote,” RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said in a press release on Friday. But Amazon says it acted within the law and that the vote represents its employees’ wishes. “It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,” the company wrote in a blog post on April 9. “Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us.” The criticism of Amazon surrounding the union vote comes after a raft of bad public relations for the company, including a February settlement with the FTC over charges it withheld tips from contracted delivery drivers; a March change to its app store logo after cell phone users complained it resembled Adolf Hitler’s infamous mustache; and an April apology for asserting its employees don’t pee in bottles when many of its drivers have to do so. Yet Amazon maintains a tight grip not just on its employees, but on major facets of American life. For some Americans, boycotting Amazon and its subsidiaries might mean losing their grocery store, Whole Foods; losing their pharmacy, PillPack; losing access to one of the thousands of websites that use Amazon Web Services to store their data, like Pinterest and Netflix; and of course, losing access to millions of products that can arrive at their doorstep via Amazon Prime in two days or less. “You can’t escape the gravitational pull of Jeff Bezos and Amazon,” says Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of business who studies how social influence impacts consumer behavior. While workers fighting to unionize in Bessemer drew support from prominent national figures like President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, many employees worried organizing a union might do more harm than good. Amazon already pays its warehouse employees at least $15 an hour, plus full healthcare, vision, and dental insurance, and 50% 401K matches. The rate is more than twice the federal minimum wage, and it can be especially attractive in Alabama, the fifth poorest state in the country. “The things that Amazon already offers are things that most unions have to fight for: paid time off, vacation, medical, dental, vision,” says J.C. Thompson, a process assistant at the plant who voted against unionizing. “We already have basically everything, in my opinion.” But other Bessemer employees felt the work—which entails 10-hour shifts, mandatory overtime, and efficiency surveillance—warranted more money and power over their working conditions. “[We] work for the richest man in the world and [he] doesn’t want to pay employees what they deserve. We only get two breaks out of 10-11 hours,” says Darryl Richardson, a Bessemer warehouse employee who approached the RWDSU about unionizing last summer. “It’s just unfair.” The fight Richardson initiated will continue. But even as the RWDSU challenges the outcome of the Bessemer vote, in the absence of stronger enforcement mechanisms for alleged labor law violations, it will remain difficult for labor groups to take on companies as large as Amazon and win. The NLRB does not have the authority to levy traditional fines against a company that commits unfair labor practices. The Board can order companies to remedy the violation, such as by reinstating wrongly terminated employees or by posting notices of workers’ rights under the NLRA, but most large employers can consider the relatively minor punishments “a cost of doing business,” says Pearce. Democrats in Congress are trying to strengthen labor laws. The Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which recently passed in the Democratic-led House, would establish monetary penalties for companies violating labor laws and ban employee interference—such as mandatory company-sponsored meetings against unionizing—during union elections. Meanwhile, Amazon continues to grow. In 2020, while millions of Americans were losing their jobs to the pandemic-induced economic recession, the retail giant announced in February that it increased its net sales the year by 38%. Its net income nearly doubled too, increasing from $11.6 billion in 2019 to $21.3 billion. The ongoing labor fight in Bessemer is unlikely to move the needle on consumer habits in 2021 either, says Adam Galinsky, a professor of leadership and ethics at the Columbia Business School. “The short term cost for Amazon coming across as a jerk during the lead up to vote count, I think it’s going to have very little consequence,” he says. “If people in your community think that Amazon is problematic, but there’s nothing close to the cost-convenience ratio that Amazon offers, I don’t think those concerns are going to override it.” Write to Abby Vesoulis at abby.vesoulis@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/5950288/amazon-union-vote-alabama/", "https://time.com/5936126/amazon-settlement-ftc/"], "sentiment_score": 0.10537840136054422, "subjectivity_score": 0.48129859086491733},

Every lockdown “click to purchase” nudged the company a little further toward utter domination of online shopping as total e-commerce sales nearly doubled in May. But if bigger was better for everyone, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos would not be appearing before Congress on Wednesday for an antitrust hearing.  Charlene Anderson, and sellers like her, are one reason why he’ll be there. Anderson is among the many merchants who sell goods on Amazon — and who together account for more than half of sales on the site. But they pay, too: Amazon charges Anderson a $39.99 monthly fee to post her knitting and craft supplies on its site, and it takes a cut of about 30 percent on each item she sells. Anderson’s seller experience has worsened during the pandemic as Amazon exercised the power of what she calls “dictatorship” over the vast internal marketplace it alone controls. In mid-March, for example, Amazon notified sellers that during the pandemic, its warehouses would accept only household staples, medical supplies and “other high-demand products,“ but it failed to explain how it determined what it would accept. Anderson could still send some colors of knitting bags to Amazon warehouses, but not others; she could send one size of knitting needles, but not another. Some sellers saw their sales evaporate; others paid USPS or other services to ship orders to customers, while still paying Amazon’s monthly fees.  Even after Amazon lifted that order, boxes of goods that Anderson ships to a warehouse still sit on loading docks for weeks, she says, and when Amazon unpacks them, it miscounts the items, an error that takes Anderson days to remedy. The company sends customers the wrong items, then allows them to leave negative feedback on her seller page despite the error being Amazon’s, says Anderson, who is 63 and lives in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. In the Facebook group she runs, Anderson says some sellers worry that the raft of problems will lower their internal scores on Amazon so much that the company will kick them off the site. But where else can they go? “What are we going to do, protest and not sell on Amazon?” Anderson asks. “Right, I’m just going to kill my whole business. They have you and they know they have you—if you go, they’ll just find someone else to sell those products.” Consumer spending on Amazon between May and July was up 60% from the same time frame last year, according to the financial data firm Facteus. The company’s extraordinary power — it has 38% of the e-commerce market, trailed by Walmart with 6% — was under scrutiny well before COVID-19. But the lockdown that boosted the company’s dominance also threw into higher relief its consequences for other businesses.  That’s increased interest in updating federal laws written more than a century ago to correct the distortions of monopolies on an economy. Bezos is appearing before a Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, part of an investigation by the House Judiciary Committee into online platforms and market power. The hearings are asking: in the age of Big Tech, how big is too big? New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway, a longtime critic of Amazon, says it’s helpful to think of Amazon’s Prime membership service as the kind of massive competitive advantage once enjoyed by railroad barons. With its extensive logistics and delivery network, Amazon not only has the eyeballs of millions of households, it is the company that ships, packs, and delivers what they buy. “Amazon already owns the rails into 115 million households in America,” says Galloway. “Do we really want one company to be the arbiter of all commerce?” Economic crises have a way of creating winners and losers. Procter & Gamble thrived during the Great Depression by doubling down on advertising; Target expanded after the 2001 recession and saw profits grow 50%. Before the pandemic, Amazon represented around 4% of total U.S. retail sales. But with the new habits formed during the pandemic, UBS predicts that by 2025, e-commerce will make up one-quarter of total retail sales, up from 15% last year. The firm also estimates that 100,000 brick and mortar retail outlets will close in the next five years. “Consumers are increasingly shifting towards online shopping,” analysts wrote. “Many of these shoppers may not get back to in-store shopping when the current state is over.” Amazon, which refused to make an executive available to comment on this article, casts itself as a friendly giant in its ubiquitous messages to consumers; it spent nearly $7 billion advertising itself in 2019 (more than double what Walmart spent). According to Ad Age, that made the company the biggest ad spender in the U.S. last year. But Amazon also sells advertising — $3.9 billion worth in the first quarter of 2020, up about 44% from a year earlier. The ads appear on Kindle, on Amazon Prime TV and on Amazon.com, some of them purchased by the same small sellers already paying to be listed on Amazon but afraid of getting lost on the site without additional promotion. Because of the way e-commerce works, advertising on Amazon is essential for just about anyone selling on the site. According to marketing surveys, when online shoppers are thinking of buying an item, about half go straight to Amazon and search for the item, rather than Googling it or visiting another website. Most don’t scroll beyond the first page of results, so for sellers, it’s essential to be featured on that first page. They can hope that positive reviews lead Amazon’s algorithm to put them there, or they can buy ads.  Amazon is now the third-biggest digital ad seller in the United States, following Facebook and Google. And as it consolidates its grip on e-commerce, it can charge more for ads on its site. Buyers now compete with each other in an auction for keywords related to their products; the more people that are competing, the higher prices go. Revenues from advertising in the first three months of this year were up 43.8% from the previous year and 359% since 2017, according to company earnings reports.“It begins to feel like they’re playing chess, and they’re thinking three to four steps ahead,” says Andrew Lipsman, a retail analyst at market research firm eMarketer. “The more I think about Amazon, the more I marvel at it.”  So do investors, who saw its stock as a haven in a treacherous equity market. Amazon has gained half a trillion dollars in market value just this year, and shares should climb even higher when earnings are reported on July 30 if, as analysts at Goldman Sachs predicted, company revenues in North America show a jump of nearly 50% from the previous year. Bezos, already the richest person in the world with a net worth of $178 billion, could become the world’s first trillionaire by 2026.  That kind of concentrated wealth invites the stark comparisons embodied by people like Susan Bengel. One of the 175,000 employees Amazon hired during a pandemic that cost 40 million American jobs, Bengel, 62, had been living in her car before she started working at an Amazon warehouse in Pennsylvania in late March. She told me she recently got an offer from UPS, but she stayed with Amazon despite difficult conditions that include being on her feet for entire night shifts. UPS couldn’t match the pay or benefits she gets at Amazon, Bengel says. “It’s a monopoly, but they provide well,” she told me after one shift, in which each worker received a Chick-fil-A boxed dinner and bottle of hand sanitizer courtesy of Amazon. As stores close in her hometown of Wayne, Pa., she turned to Amazon to buy what she needs, including new shoes and back braces to get her through her shifts.  For Amazon shoppers, there’s not much not to like, apart from the unease at feeding a behemoth that competitors say is gobbling up their customers. Amazon argues that it’s not a monopoly, since it competes with brick and mortar stores for sales. “There’s a single retail market of which online is one channel. People do not shop exclusively online,” an Amazon spokesman said in a statement. But stores without Amazon’s logistics network are finding it impossible to compete. While Amazon was hiring tens of thousands of new workers, Jeff Curtis was running around his Maine bookshop, Sherman’s, scrambling to fulfill online orders much as Bezos had done in the mid-90s during Amazon’s early days selling only books online. But Curtis was by himself, because his store was closed to comply with stay-at-home orders. He says the state denied his request for special dispensation to bring in workers to help, even as Amazon was allowed to have on-site employees fulfill its own rush of online orders. Curtis has already decided to permanently close one of six branches of his store and is worried he may have to close another. It is the way of the world Amazon has built. Kathy Gonzalez, who runs two retail stores in northwest Florida, says she’s tried to offer shipping for furniture and other items she sells, but the cost is so high that people turn to Amazon, where shipping is free.  “If you want to be able to reach customers online, you’re essentially compelled to be on Amazon’s platform, but Amazon’s platform is not a place that you can succeed,” says Stacy Mitchell, the co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. “With this sudden surge in online shopping, all of that has been magnified.” Its mammoth size gives Amazon advantages available only to itself: One of its companies, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a cloud computing platform that lets companies rent space on a network of servers. Its $35 billion in sales in 2019 (up 36% from the previous year) provided a financial cushion that let Amazon subsidize grocery delivery, expand its network of warehouses, and dare to offer one-day shipping without worrying about huge losses. The company now has 1,223 buildings covering 278 million square feet in its global logistics network, up 82% since 2016, according to MWPVL International, a supply chain and logistics consulting firm, and it’s still expanding at an “unprecedented” pace,” says Marc Wulfraat, founder and president of MWPVL. It built or announced plans to build 49 million square feet of logistics space in the U.S. between March and July alone, he says. Amazon’s deep pockets are also ensuring the company’s ability to operate during the coronavirus in a way no other company can. Bezos said in late April that Amazon was investing $4 billion in coronavirus-protection efforts, including personal protective equipment for workers, enhanced cleaning at facilities, and development of its own COVID-19 testing capabilities. Galloway calls this the first “vaccinated supply chain,” and says it will help Amazon further dominate competitors as more people choose to buy and sell products through a service that has invested in being virus-free.  Amazon also continues to invest in technologies that will further consolidate its grip on e-commerce. In June, the company said it would spend $1.2 billion to acquire Zoox, a startup that makes self-driving vehicles, which could help in its delivery services. Amazon is expanding its fleet of cargo planes as other airlines lease them for cheap, the better to lessen its reliance on FedEx and UPS. It invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Rivian, an electric car company, and ordered 100,000 electric vans from the startup. In July, Amazon said it would open more cashier-less Amazon Go stores.  “Some people—and I’m one of them—only buy something if it’s on Amazon” says Brandon Fishman, CEO of VitaCup, which sells vitamin-infused coffee and tea both in retail stores and online and which saw a 35% increase in its Amazon sales in March and April. Fishman says it’s cheaper for him to sell his products in brick and mortar stores than to sell them on Amazon, because of the cut Amazon takes for packing and shipping. But he doesn’t want to miss out on e-commerce customers, who are his most loyal. More than half the people who buy VitaCup products on Amazon return to the site to buy more. “Third party sellers would say it’s a deal with the devil,” says Galloway, the NYU professor. “Amazon brings us a lot of revenue, and we become addicted to it, but every year our economics get worse.”  In April, the Wall Street Journal  reported that Amazon had been using data from third-party sellers to determine which items were selling well, then making private-label versions of the same products to compete with the sellers’ products. (Amazon said such a practice would violate its policies, and it vowed to investigate.) Other sellers have alleged that Amazon does not take down counterfeit versions of items sold on its site; they suspect that the company does not want to lose the fees it collects from both legitimate and non-legitimate sellers. (Amazon says it invests “heavily” in prohibiting the sale of counterfeit products, using automated systems to help ferret out counterfeits, and that 99.9% of all pages visited by customers did not receive a notice of potential counterfeit infringement.)  During the pandemic, sellers say, communication has worsened and Amazon has slowed its response to flagrant problems on the site. Charlene Anderson says she can’t sell a knitting gauge because the picture is inaccurate on Amazon’s catalog page; she has been trying the problem fixed for three months. In July, Anderson says, Amazon told sellers it was going to restrict how many products they could keep in warehouses based on a performance metric. The ups and downs of the pandemic have meant that while Anderson’s sales were down in the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, they’re up about 3% now. But some sellers in the Facebook group she runs report their sales are down more than 50%. Most frustrating for all of them is the inconsistency; they have no idea when Amazon will change the rules again. “We hate having to deal with all of this, but to build our business, we have to,” Anderson says. Amazon says its platform allows anybody to make an income in an otherwise challenging pandemic economy, and that it is working to help sellers while meeting increased demand from consumers. “Our commitment to our selling partners has never been more steadfast,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. In the twelve months ending May 31, 2020, small and medium-sized businesses sold 3.4 billion products, up 25% from the same time the previous year, according to a report Amazon released July 21. Amazon says the average American small and medium-sized seller had more than $160,000 in sales during that time, though it did not provide averages for how much these sellers took home after expenses.  Amazon is now valued by the stock market at $1.5 trillion, a figure that dwarfs the GDP of Saudi Arabia. The very thing that has made it so successful during the pandemic—its size and the many layers of its businesses—is what has given it so much leverage over sellers, workers and governments. Existing antitrust laws are designed to protect the consumer from predatory pricing. That orientation has shielded Amazon, because the company in many cases saves consumers money, but it is being questioned by scholars, and now lawmakers.  Critics say that regulating or breaking up Amazon will be better for merchants on its site and also, in the long term, for the economy. The rate of start-up creation in the United States has been falling for years; there is some evidence that this is because big companies like Amazon use their size to force smaller competitors out of business, or prevent them from being created in the first place. If small manufacturers and retailers had a fighting chance in competing with Amazon, they might help reverse the decline in start-up creation. New businesses in America are much of what drives the country’s productivity and economic growth, raising its standard of living and spreading wealth and jobs.  Historically, antitrust enforcement has helped upstarts; Companies like Google arose in part because of government antitrust action against Microsoft in the 1990s; the breakup of AT&T in the 1980s helped launch a technology renaissance.  “A key component of our success as a society is this very basic notion of checks and balances,” says Galloway, of NYU. “We’ve tried to avoid dictatorships, we try to avoid monopolies. We don’t have a judge, we have a judge and jury. And we believe in the wisdom of crowds.”  Charlene Anderson agrees. She says she and other sellers don’t want Amazon to disappear. If that happened, they would lose their income source and their access to millions of shoppers. They just want better communication with Amazon, more democracy, less dictatorship. “Amazon is not transparent at all,” she says. “Amazon will not tell you anything.”  Wednesday’s hearing before the House subcommittee on antitrust law will test that allegation, and more, as Congress peaks behind the curtain of one of America’s most successful companies. The next question is whether it has the tools to do anything about what it sees.

What the Saga of One of the World’s Richest Men Reveals About China Under Xi Jinping", "author": "Charlie Campbell / Shanghai", "update_date/publish_date": "January 4, 2021 5:30 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5926062/jack-ma/", "text": "The response was as swift as it was resolute. On Oct. 24, Jack Ma, the man behind China’s e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, gave a speech in Shanghai at the Bund Summit, a gathering billed as a “an open, pragmatic and internationally influential financial high-end communication platform.” In such a setting, 56-year-old Ma probably felt entitled to share a few insights from a career that has seen him take Alibaba from a company of less than 20 people—started in his flat in the coastal city of Hangzhou in 1999—to a tech giant that pulled in $71.985 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ending Mar. 31, 2020. According to an English transcript published by Hong Kong’s Apple Daily newspaper, Ma, who is personally worth $48.2 billion, hedged his speech carefully. He described himself as “a somewhat retired man … sharing the non-professional views of a non-professional” and conceded that his ideas might be “immature, inaccurate or even laughable.” Politely, he threw in a couple of quotes from China’s strongman President Xi Jinping. But as he began inviting the audience—described by Reuters as “the great and the good of China’s financial, regulatory and political establishment”—to consider the need for reform of the country’s financial system, he crossed a line. He obliquely chided Chinese regulators for stifling innovation, and said that Chinese banks suffered from a “pawnshop mentality” given that banks, like the informal lenders of yore, still relied on a system of “pledges and collateral.” This wasn’t all bad, Ma granted. “In the old days,” he pointed out, “a pawnshop was an advanced idea. Had it not been for innovations such as pledges and collateral, there would be no financial institutions today, and the Chinese economy would not have developed over the past 40 years to such a point now.” But the listening cadres were infuriated. On Nov. 2, Ma was summoned by Chinese authorities for questioning. The next day, the $37 billion IPO of Alibaba’s fintech arm Ant Financial—touted as a record-breaking offering—was nixed by China’s securities watchdog despite it earlier having received a green light. By late December, regulators had instructed Ant Group to restructure its operations to adhere to new anti-monopoly rules, shaving billions off its valuation. Then, late last week, Ma was replaced by another Alibaba executive for the televised final episode of a business talent contest he had been helming, with his picture scrubbed from the gallery of judges. Ma has now not been seen in public for at least two months. An Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment on his whereabouts when contacted by TIME. If Ma has indeed fallen from favor, then he has tumbled a long way. Being something of a global business celebrity, he was tacitly entrusted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to project a modern, go-ahead image for the country’s entrepreneurs. Official policy visions like Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035, which seek to write the rules of next-generation trade and technology, read like chapters from the play book of a man whose Ant Financial claims to have over 1.3 billion users of its Alipay mobile payment service around the globe. Yet it’s clear that the CCP under President Xi will not countenance any challenge to its authority. Given a slowing Chinese economy and mounting geopolitical headwinds, Beijing is nervous about systematic financial risks and rising debt. This is no time to be calling, as Ma did, for a loosening of the system. And just as seemingly unassailable titans of real estate, finance and show-biz previously discovered, China’s tech champion is learning that loyalty comes first in Xi’s China. “There is no so-called [Ma] era,” read a recent headline in the CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily, “but only an era that has [Ma] in it.” Ma used to be thought untouchable. Beloved as a self-made tech mogul who didn’t even know how to code, he delighted Chinese audiences with tales of repeated rejection. (When KFC opened a store years ago in his native Hangzhou, Ma says he was the only applicant not to be hired.) Yet a fearsome work ethic, and a gift for reading the trends of the digital economy, propelled this former English teacher into being China’s richest man. A party member who regularly appeared alongside China’s top leaders, Ma even became a sort of unofficial ambassador, meeting then President-elect Donald Trump in January 2017, during which he promised to bring a million jobs to the U.S. “Jack and I are going to do some great things,” Trump told reporters at the time. Ma assumed the limelight with relish, performing in rock concerts, dressing as Michael Jackson, and starring in a kung fu movie. But ostentation is anathema to China’s drab apparatchiks and may well have led authorities to guide public opinion against him. Ma’s defense of China’s strict “996” work culture—9am to 9pm, six days a week—led some to decry him as an “capitalist bloodsucker” and quote Marx in rebuke. “An outstanding people’s billionaire like Jack Ma will definitely be hung from the lamppost,” one commentator wrote in a post that was read over 100,000 times on WeChat and liked 122,000 times on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo. Han Fuling, a professor at Beijing’s Central University of Finance and Economics, wrote on Weibo that Ma’s opinions “were full of ignorance and arrogance about finance!” Officially, at least, Ma had stepped down as Alibaba’s chairman in October and was ostensibly dedicating himself to philanthropy. Following the coronavirus pandemic, his Jack Ma Foundation sent PPE to 150 countries, including 500,000 testing kits and a million masks to the U.S., stating “we join hands with Americans in these difficult times.” Other projects include fostering education in China and entrepreneurship across Africa. Perhaps Ma’s charitable refocus led him to miss the hardening tenor of government policy. Just a month before his Shanghai speech, the CCP publicized new guidelines on how private enterprises are to help the Chinese state now that “risks and challenges have increased significantly” from the expanded private economy. Of course, this runs counter to the repeated and pained efforts by Chinese-owned tech firms such as Huawei, Tencent, TikTok and Alibaba to portray themselves as independent of government control in the face of mounting U.S. pressure. Persistent reports suggesting that Ant Financial might be forced to pass a large chunk of shares to the state could likewise torpedo its global expansion goals. “The government is reminding companies that, at the end of the day, we’re the ones who make the regulations, we’re the ones who issue the licenses,” says Mark Natkin, founder of Beijing-based IT research firm Marbridge Consulting. “And if you forget, then you may find an entire area of your business doesn’t get licensed, or your IPO gets halted, or whatever we need to do just to make sure you know who’s the parent and who’s the child.” It’s a precarious tightrope that risks not only casting a pall over investor confidence but also undermining the willingness of entrepreneurs to take risks—especially in the liminal zones of commerce, where the rules are poorly defined but the payoffs may be greatest. China didn’t have clear regulations on third-party payments services when Ma first launched Alipay, for example, and the risks of meddling in financial services were plain to him. “If someone has to go to jail, I’ll go,” Ma brazenly told colleagues at the time. In Xi’s China, Ma may live to regret those words.

{"type": "article", "header": "How to Wake Up To Your Creativity", "author": "Jeffrey Kluger", "update_date/publish_date": "April 30, 2017 5:00 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4737596/sleep-brain-creativity/", "text": "The following story is excerpted from TIME’s special edition, The Science of Sleep, which is available at Amazon. Sleep is, as ancient maps once labeled uncharted territories, where the dragons be. To go to sleep is to enter a world entirely like our own and entirely unlike it, too. You can board a plane that’s really a car that flies to Russia, except it’s the moon and your mom is there—until she’s your dad. Dreams can be prosaic or repetitive (exactly how many times can you show up at the same party in your underwear before you remember to put something on?), but whatever they are, they remain mysterious. The sleeping brain runs its absurdist-movie loop all night long, always taking care to conceal what’s behind it. Right? No longer. Neuroscientists have a growing arsenal of tools—fMRIs, PET scans, high-density EEGs—to watch the nocturnal brain at work and see how it ticks throughout the sleep cycle. To the surprise and delight of researchers, that’s finally helping explain one of the mind’s most ineffable qualities: creativity. We’ve all slept on a problem and had it sort itself out by morning. But that’s only a small part of what the brain on nighttime autopilot can do. Paul McCartney famously said that he came up with the melody for “Yesterday” in a dream; Elias Howe, the inventor of the sewing machine, is said to have solved the problem of the machine’s needle when he dreamed of an attack by warriors carrying spears with holes in the tips. “Dreams are just thinking in a different biochemical state,” says Harvard University psychologist Deirdre Barrett, author of The Committee of Sleep. “In the sleep state, the brain thinks much more visually and intuitively.” The hunt for the source of human creativity has been going on for as long as people have been creating. It drives all of us to wonder how celebrated inventors came up with ideas that became the next big thing. And it drives us to wonder how we’ll find our own next brainstorm when we need it. It’s no secret that sleep can be a well of good ideas—what we’re learning now is how to dip into it. You, uncensored The act of sleeping, as researchers have long known, is a lot more complicated than just conking out for the night. There are two principal cycles of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) and non–rapid eye movement (NREM), and they alternate. NREM sleep starts as a light doze— sleep at no greater than snorkeling depth—and steadily progresses to deeper levels at which muscles relax, heart rate and respiration slow, and body temperature drops. REM sleep usually begins about 90 minutes after the start of the first NREM cycle and is the true blue ocean of sleep. Heart rate and respiration accelerate, and brain activity, as measured by electroencephalograms (EEGs), increases too—a function of dreaming. For this reason, muscles become paralyzed, lest you act out the scenes unspooling in your head. Know those dreams in which you’re trying to run away from something but can’t seem to move your legs? That’s not your imagination. Most REM sleep comes in the last four hours of sleep, says cognitive neuroscientist Jessica Payne of Notre Dame University. “Dreams in the early, NREM phase can be kind of literal. It’s in the REM phase that you get all these crazy binding errors.” “Binding errors” is one of those lovely scientific terms that mean pretty much what they sound like. Your waking brain is orderly, your sleeping brain is fragmented, and as with all broken things, the bits can get reassembled the wrong way. But “the wrong way” suggests that there’s just one way, and the genius of sleep is that it allows you to explore other, untried avenues. In a frequently cited 2009 study, investigators at UCLA and the University of California, San Diego, recruited a group of volunteers and had them solve a type of word puzzle known as the remote-association test (RAT). In a typical RAT question, subjects are given three words and asked to determine a fourth word that links them all. The answer for the words “broken,” “clear” and “eye,” for example, would be “glass.” The volunteers had to take the test twice; between the two sessions, they were told to take a 40-minute nap. Some just rested in that interval, others dozed, and some tumbled into the depths of REM sleep. In Round 2 of the tests, participants who got a slug of REM improved 40%, while the other volunteers saw their scores go down. Sleep, it appeared, sharpened their brains’ ability to find links among words. A 2004 study from the University of Lübeck in Germany approached the same idea in a more revealing way. Subjects were required to complete math problems that relied on algorithms, but hidden deep within the formulas was an elegant arithmetical shortcut. About 25% of the subjects discovered it on their own. But that figure jumped to 59% when volunteers were given a chance to get eight hours of sleep and then come back for more. “If you have an idea about a simpler solution and it’s been working itself out in your head, you still tend to use the familiar one,” says cognitive neuroscientist Howard Nusbaum of the University of Chicago. When you sleep, the better answer has a chance to emerge. The hard drive in your head The key to the brain’s ability to make such good use of downtime is something it shares with your computer: the capacity to run multiple programs at once. The aha moment you experience when you’ve been trying to remember the name of a song and three hours later it hits you is no accident. “Conscious awareness is able to focus on only one thing at a time,” says Barrett, “but problems go on getting processed under the radar.” Sleeping doubles down on this. The prefrontal cortex performs a traffic cop role, doing more than just keeping the brain focused on a conscious task. It also screens out thoughts that it decides you oughtn’t think of at all. The forbidden concepts aren’t just things that are socially inappropriate—though those are on the list—but also those deemed rationally inappropriate. In sleep, that brake on your imagination comes off, which explains the German math study. At the same time, the prefrontal censor is dialing itself down, the brain’s visual centers, in the occipital lobe at the back of the head, are dialing up. The hallucinogenic quality of dreams is a result of the visual centers’ mixing images at will. That’s usually just chaff, but not always. One night in 1816, Mary Shelley dreamed of a man assembled from bits beyond the grave—and went on to write Frankenstein. Just as important as which regions of the brain are working is how they communicate. We think of the left hemisphere as the rational, mathematical region and the right as the creative, more bohemian one, and that’s a fair division. But a study conducted by neuroscientist Lisa Aziz- Zadeh of the University of Southern California found that the brain is not quite so bifurcated. When architecture students undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans were asked to perform a visual-spatial task—arranging geometric shapes in their heads to see if they could be assembled into a square or a triangle— the right, artistic hemisphere carried the load. When they were given a slightly more creative task—arranging a circle, a C and an 8 in various ways to form a face—the right hemisphere called on the assistance of the left. “The specific regions that are active during the creative process largely depend on the kind of task the person is engaged in,” says Aziz-Zadeh. Another study at the University of Rome found something similar. With the help of EEGs, investigators tracked communication between hemispheres when subjects were awake, in NREM sleep and in REM. In the waking and NREM states, information traveled mainly from left to right, consistent with the idea that the left brain controls the right. During REM sleep, however, there was no preferred direction. The right can thus come out of the shadows. Synapses—the cell-to-cell links that serve as the bits of the brain’s operating system—play an important role too. Each brain cell can link to more than just one other, and it would seem that the more connections there are, the better, since that makes for a richer system. That’s indeed true, but only to a point. Too many connections can lead to chaotic free association rather than organized thought. So the brain must periodically clear out the synaptic underbrush—analogous to “running a repair-and-cleaning program on your computer to defrag the hard drive,” says psychologist William Killgore of Harvard Medical School. The hormone cortisol rises during REM, then helps form new and imaginative ideas from the data that survives the defrag. Cortisol is a stress hormone and tends to fracture memory. It has the same effect when we’re asleep, and Payne believes this encourages the unbinding and rebinding of images that can define dreams. “The brain dislikes fragmentation, so it weaves narratives,” she says. “And that, in turn, gives rise to novel thinking.” Dopamine is another ingredient in the brain’s secret creative sauce. Harvard psychologist Shelley Carson points out that dopamine levels rise in pleasure centers of the brain both when we’re dreaming and when we’re being creative. This serves as a reward and reinforcement that keeps the dreams—and ideas—flowing. Controlling the process As with all other matters scientific, the question of causation comes up. Are we all equally imaginative in our sleep, or do people who are already creative in their waking hours retain that edge at night? Much as it would be nice to think that sleep is a great democratizer, the fact is, creative types may indeed have an advantage around the clock. Psychologist David Watson of the University of Notre Dame tracked 200 subjects over three months and found that those who scored high on creativity scales when they were awake tended to remember their dreams more. “One reason is that they simply have more vivid and interesting dreams,” he says. “That’s linked to having an active fantasy life; the daytime behavior shades over into the night. This is a case of the rich getting richer.” That’s not to say the creative middle class can’t aspire to join that metaphorical 1%. The best strategy for remembering dreams is keeping a journal next to your bed, says Watson. Avoiding alcohol and caffeine is also wise, since they scramble the NREM and REM cycles. Barrett’s studies suggest that engaging in some type of pre-bedtime priming—contemplating a problem you’d like to solve—increases the likelihood that sleep will bring some answers. Up to a third of the subjects in one of her sample groups reported that priming had helped them find a solution that had eluded them during the day.

For many of those small companies (and quite a few larger ones) the objective is straightforward: leverage new advances in computing, especially artificial intelligence (AI), to disrupt industries from social networking to medical research.  But for Meredith Whittaker and Kate Crawford, who co-founded AI Now together in 2017, it’s that disruption itself that’s under scrutiny. They are two of many experts who are working to ensure that, as corporations, entrepreneurs and governments roll out new AI applications, they do so in a way that’s ethically sound. “These tools are now impacting so many parts of our everyday life, from healthcare to criminal justice to education to hiring, and it’s happening simultaneously,” says Crawford. “That raises very serious implications about how people will be affected.” AI has plenty of success stories, with positive outcomes in fields from healthcare to education to urban planning. But there have also been unexpected pitfalls. AI software has been abused as part of disinformation campaigns, accused of perpetuating racial and socioeconomic biases, and criticized for overstepping privacy bounds.  To help ensure future AI is developed in humanity’s best interest, AI Now’s researchers have divided the challenges into four categories: rights and liberties; labor and automation; bias and inclusion; and safety and critical infrastructure. Rights and liberties pertains to the potential for AI to infringe on people’s civil liberties, like cases of facial recognition technology in public spaces. Labor and automation encompasses how workers are impacted by automated management and hiring systems. Bias and inclusion has to do with the potential for AI systems to exacerbate historical discrimination against marginalized groups. Finally, safety and critical infrastructure looks at risks posed by incorporating AI into important systems like the energy grid. Each of those issues is gaining more of government leaders’ attention. In late June, Whittaker and other AI experts testified on the societal and ethical implications of AI before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, while Rashida Richardson, AI Now’s director of policy research, spoke before the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation and the Internet. Tech workers are taking action as well. In 2018, some Google employees, led in part by Whittaker (who worked at the search giant until earlier this summer) organized in opposition to Project Maven, a Pentagon contract to design AI image recognition software for military drones. Also that year, Marriott workers went on strike to protest the implementation of AI systems that may have automated their jobs, among other grievances. Even some tech executives have joined calls for increased government oversight of the sector.  AI Now is far from the only research institute founded in recent years to study ethical issues in AI. At Stanford University, the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence has put ethical and societal implications at the core of its thinking on AI development, while the University of Michigan’s new Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing (ESC) focuses on addressing technology’s potential to replicate and exacerbate inequality and discrimination. Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society concentrates in part on the challenges of ethics and governance in AI. In 2019, the organization co-hosted an “Assembly” program with the MIT Media lab, which brought together policymakers and technologists to work on AI ethics projects, like detecting bias in AI systems and accounting for the ethical risks of pursuing surveillance-related AI research.  But in many ways, the field of AI ethics remains limited. Researchers say they are blocked from investigating many systems thanks to trade secrecy protections and laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). As interpreted by the courts, that law criminalizes breaking a website or platform’s terms of service, an often necessary step for researchers trying to audit online AI systems for unfair biases.  That may soon change. In 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a suit against the U.S. Department of Justice in which the plaintiffs — a group of journalists and computer science academics — alleged that the CFAA’s protections are unconstitutional.“It’s a cutting-edge case,” says Esha Bhandari, the ACLU lawyer representing the plaintiffs. “It’s about the right to conduct anti-discrimination testing in the 21st century online.”  Whatever the outcome of Bhandari’s case, researchers in AI ethics tend to agree that more needs to be done to ensure AI is working for our benefit. Of the experts who spoke with TIME, all agreed that regulation would help matters. As Lilly Irani, professor of communication, science studies and critical gender studies at the University of California San Diego puts it, “we can’t have a system where people are just harmed, harmed, harmed, and we rely on them to scream.” The path forward for ethical AI isn’t straightforward. Christian Sandvig, professor of digital media at the University of Michigan and director of ESC (and also a plaintiff in the 2016 suit against the Justice Department) worries that genuine calls for change in the AI field could be derailed in a process he calls “ethics-washing,” in which efforts to create more ethical AI look good on paper, but don’t actually accomplish much. Ethics-washing, Sandvig says, “make[s] it seem as though transformational change has occurred by liberally applying the word ‘ethics’ as though it were paint.” Whittaker acknowledges the potential for the AI ethics movement to be co-opted. But as someone who has fought for accountability from within Silicon Valley and outside it, Whittaker says she has seen the tech world begin to undergo a deep transformation in recent years. “You have thousands and thousands of workers across the industry who are recognizing the stakes of their work,” Whittaker explains. “We don’t want to be complicit in building things that do harm. We don’t want to be complicit in building things that benefit only a few and extract more and more from the many.”  It may be too soon to tell if that new consciousness will precipitate real systemic change. But facing academic, regulatory and internal scrutiny, it is at least safe to say that the industry won’t be going back to the adolescent, devil-may-care days of “move fast and break things” anytime soon.  “There has been a significant shift and it can’t be understated,” says Whittaker. “The cat is out of the box, and it’s not going back in.” Write to Alejandro de la Garza at alejandro.delagarza@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/5610094/cogito-ai-artificial-intelligence/", "https://time.com/5574143/technology-regulated-apple-tim-cook/"], "sentiment_score": 0.09614215750579388, "subjectivity_score": 0.44933971752153584},

Here’s How to Solve It", "author": "Joy Buolamwini", "update_date/publish_date": "February 7, 2019 7:00 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5520558/artificial-intelligence-racial-gender-bias/", "text": "Machines can discriminate in harmful ways. I experienced this firsthand, when I was a graduate student at MIT in 2015 and discovered that some facial analysis software couldn’t detect my dark-skinned face until I put on a white mask. These systems are often trained on images of predominantly light-skinned men. And so, I decided to share my experience of the coded gaze, the bias in artificial intelligence that can lead to discriminatory or exclusionary practices.  Altering myself to fit the norm—in this case better represented by a white mask than my actual face—led me to realize the impact of the exclusion overhead, a term I coined to describe the cost of systems that don’t take into account the diversity of humanity. How much does a person have to change themselves to function with technological systems that increasingly govern our lives? We often assume machines are neutral, but they aren’t. My research uncovered large gender and racial bias in AI systems sold by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon. Given the task of guessing the gender of a face, all companies performed substantially better on male faces than female faces. The companies I evaluated had error rates of no more than 1% for lighter-skinned men. For darker-skinned women, the errors soared to 35%. AI systems from leading companies have failed to correctly classify the faces of Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Serena Williams. When technology denigrates even these iconic women, it is time to re-examine how these systems are built and who they truly serve. There’s no shortage of headlines highlighting tales of failed machine learning systems that amplify, rather than rectify, sexist hiring practices, racist criminal justice procedures, predatory advertising, and the spread of false information. Though these research findings can be discouraging, at least we’re paying attention now. This gives us the opportunity to highlight issues early and prevent pervasive damage down the line. Computer vision experts, the ACLU, and the Algorithmic Justice League, which I founded in 2016, have all uncovered racial bias in facial analysis and recognition technology. Given what we know now, as well as the history of racist police brutality, there needs to be a moratorium on using such technology in law enforcement—including in equipping drones or police body cameras with facial analysis or recognition software for lethal operations. See the 2019 Optimists issue, guest-edited by Ava DuVernay. We can organize to protest this technology being used dangerously. When people’s lives, livelihoods, and dignity are on the line, AI must be developed and deployed with care and oversight. This is why I launched the Safe Face Pledge to prevent the lethal use and mitigate abuse of facial analysis and recognition technology. Already three companies have agreed to sign the pledge. As more people question how seemingly neutral technology has gone astray, it’s becoming clear just how important it is to have broader representation in the design, development, deployment, and governance of AI. The underrepresentation of women and people of color in technology, and the under-sampling of these groups in the data that shapes AI, has led to the creation of technology that is optimized for a small portion of the world. Less than 2% of employees in technical roles at Facebook and Google are black. At eight large tech companies evaluated by Bloomberg, only around a fifth of the technical workforce at each are women. I found one government dataset of faces collected for testing that contained 75% men and 80% lighter-skinned individuals and less than 5% women of color—echoing the pale male data problem that excludes so much of society in the data that fuels AI. Issues of bias in AI tend to most adversely affect the people who are rarely in positions to develop technology. Being a black woman, and an outsider in the field of AI, enables me to spot issues many of my peers overlooked. I am optimistic that there is still time to shift towards building ethical and inclusive AI systems that respect our human dignity and rights. By working to reduce the exclusion overhead and enabling marginalized communities to engage in the development and governance of AI, we can work toward creating systems that embrace full spectrum inclusion.  In addition to lawmakers, technologists, and researchers, this journey will require storytellers who embrace the search for truth through art and science. Storytelling has the power to shift perspectives, galvanize change, alter damaging patterns, and reaffirm to others that their experiences matter. That’s why art can explore the emotional, societal, and historical connections of algorithmic bias in ways academic papers and statistics cannot. And as long as stories ground our aspirations, challenge harmful assumptions, and ignite change, I remain hopeful. See the 2019 Optimists issue, guest-edited by Ava DuVernay.

{"type": "article", "header": "The Promise—And Possible Perils—of Editing What We Say Online", "author": "Megan McCluskey", "update_date/publish_date": "September 23, 2022 10:50 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6215340/edit-tweets-imessages-consequences/", "text": "Have you ever sent a text or shared something online that you immediately regretted? Most of us have. Facing the ramifications of saying something thoughtless, reckless, or rash can be a daunting prospect for anyone who frequently communicates by typing out messages and then flinging them into the digital ether. Now, a growing number of apps and services are offering users the alluring ability to edit those messages. In the past month alone, two tech giants, Twitter and Apple, have introduced editing features. Twitter kicked off September by announcing it would begin testing an edit button, first internally and then among subscribers of its paid Twitter Blue service. Within two weeks of that move, Apple released its new iOS 16 operating system, which lets users—for the first time—edit and unsend iMessages. Amid these developments, tech analysts have continued to voice concern over how these features could be used for nefarious purposes, such as spreading disinformation. It’s a trend that speaks to a desire among users to speak freely online without overthinking what they’re sharing, says Mor Naaman, a professor of information science at Cornell Tech. “People want to present themselves in the best light, but also to share freely without excessive cognitive load,” he says. “The edit button, if it works well, can support both goals.” Editing tools have been a long-sought-after feature on both services. But demand for a Twitter edit button, in particular, reached new heights earlier this year after Elon Musk polled his followers as to whether they wanted one, shortly before he made an offer to buy the company.  Given the success of edit tools on platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and Slack, Christina Wodtke, a lecturer in computer science at Stanford University, says it’s somewhat surprising that Twitter and Apple didn’t get there sooner. “It’s been pretty common to be able to edit your web posts for a long time, going back to the early web forums,” she says. “Apple and Twitter have a legacy of being built on mobile, rather than on the web. And a mobile SMS doesn’t normally have edits. But now people are asking, why not?” Apple has responded by introducing an edit tool to iMessage. Users can now edit an iMessage up to five times within 15 minutes after sending it and unsend any message up to two minutes after it’s sent. To do this, users need only to tap and hold their sent message, then select “edit” or “undo send.” The message’s recipient will receive an alert that it has been edited or unsent, and can tap “Edited” to see previous versions of the message. These new capabilities have the potential to alter the way people view private messages, Naaman says. “Messages were seen like postcards. Nobody expects you to come to their home and edit the Hawaii postcard you sent them,” he says. “But we do expect to be able to edit, say, our Facebook profile, at any time. If the implementation is right, expectations will change and edits may become acceptable.” On Twitter, users will be able to edit a tweet up to five times in the 30 minutes after it’s posted. Once a change is made, a tweet will be marked with an icon, a timestamp and a label that says “Last Edited,” which users can click on to see how the tweet has been edited. The button will give people a “generous” timeframe to workshop their tweets in the court of public opinion, says Wodtke. “What they’re doing is creating an edit button that allows the Twitter audience to be your personal editor,” she says. “So, if you said something that’s lame, you could quickly change it to be more clear or less open to being misinterpreted.” Twitter says the feature was intentionally designed to be transparent and protect the integrity of the conversation. “We’re purposely starting this test with a smaller group to learn and address potential issues before bringing it to more people,” a Twitter spokesperson says. To ensure edit tools are used in good faith, experts say tech companies must take certain precautions. The importance of an “edit trail” that prevents the spread of mis- and disinformation can’t be overstated, says Wodtke. Especially when the information is part of the public record. “[Twitter] has a moral imperative to show the history of edits,” she says. Twitter’s implementation of an edit button indicates that it’s trying to strike a balance between allowing self-expression and preventing abuse, says Naaman. He says one of the main threats the company is likely trying to protect against is users editing a tweet after its gone viral to completely change its meaning. “Such an edit, while available via the interface, may not be immediately visible to people who are just viewing the shared tweet,” he says. Even with these safeguards, Wodtke predicts that bad actors will still find ways to take advantage of the feature. “Anytime you put something out there, no matter how well you and your team thought it through, people are gonna find new ways to use it,” she says. “This is definitely no exception. I think we’re going to see a lot of hijinks.” Write to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.12544981060606056, "subjectivity_score": 0.4576873647186147},
{"type": "article", "header": "This App Could Fix Your Social Media Addiction", "author": "Billy Perrigo", "update_date/publish_date": "December 14, 2022 10:52 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6240981/social-media-addiction-app/", "text": "Frederik Riedel was addicted to Instagram. It was the first COVID-19 lockdown and, stuck at home in Berlin, Riedel knew he was spending too much time on the app. He knew that he felt worse after using it than before. And yet, multiple times a day, his finger would gravitate to the little square icon. To quit, he first tried going cold turkey. That didn’t work—it was too easy to get around. Next, he tried the function on his phone that let him set time limits on his apps. That didn’t work either, for the same reason.  “We’ve all been there,” Riedel, 27, says. “I started to question myself, like, ‘Why is this happening?’ And then of course, as an app developer, I tried to find solutions.” The solution Riedel settled upon was simple: remove the element of instant gratification that makes opening social media apps so addictive. He designed an app that would activate whenever his finger clicked the Instagram icon, and force him to wait for about 10 seconds before continuing. During the intermission, the app would invite him to take a deep breath. Just by introducing that tiny element of friction, Riedel discovered, his social media use began to decline drastically.  “It’s fascinating to me,” Riedel says, “that such a small change can really impact our habits long-term.” He uploaded the iOS app—which he called “one sec”—to Apple’s app store at the end of 2020, where it has now surpassed a quarter of a million downloads. This month, he released browser extensions that bring the same experience to the web. An Android version is currently in beta mode, with an official release coming soon. The results aren’t just anecdotal. Over the course of six weeks, one sec can cut by 57% the number of attempts by the average user to open their app of choice, according to a scientific study of 280 participants from earlier this year. (The study, by behavioral psychologists at the Max Planck Institute and Heidelberg University, is currently under peer-review for publication in the PNAS Journal.) Part of this reduction came from users deciding not to open the app when confronted by the breathing exercise; further reduction came from their reduced number of attempts to even open the app in the first place after six weeks of use.  Social media addiction is a growing problem. A full 35% of U.S. teenagers say that they are using at least one social media app “almost constantly,” according to an August report by Pew Research Center. The most popular app among teens is YouTube, with TikTok and Instagram not far behind. Many teens, especially girls, blame Instagram for exacerbating their poor self-esteem, according to internal company documents disclosed by a whistleblower in 2021. According to the Pew survey, 36% of teens feel they spend “too much” time on social media, and 54% say it would be either hard or very hard to “give up” their use of the apps entirely.  In that climate, an app like one sec—which helps wean users off social media rather than cutting it off entirely—is a quiet revolution. After two years of using one sec, Riedel says, his digital life has been transformed. While he still uses Instagram, he no longer finds himself opening it automatically. “When I open social media apps, which I still do, I only use them now if I have a purpose,” he says. “I have been able to establish a healthy relationship with social media.” In the two years since Riedel first uploaded one sec to the app store, he has built out a raft of additional features. The core version of the app – which lets you set limits on a single app – will always be free, he says, but for $10 per year the app can do much more. The “pro” version lets you set limits on as many apps as you like, and it tells you how many times in the last 24 hours you have attempted to open each app. You can turn on the intention tracking feature—which forces you to give a reason for opening the app before it lets you continue. You can set a reminder that will go off five minutes after you open the app, if you want to stop yourself from getting sucked in. And you can write your own list of “healthy alternatives” – like reading a book or texting a friend—as inspiration for things to do instead of scrolling. The Android version of the app is significantly more sparse right now, with no “pro” version and few additional features. Still, after using it for several weeks in an attempt to cure my Twitter addiction, the effects are clear as day. As I write these words, the app tells me I’ve only attempted to open Twitter six times in the last 24 hours—down from an embarrassing average of more than 20 in the first days after installing one sec. Riedel says charging a yearly fee for the pro version means he will never have to resort to ads or monetizing user data to keep the app afloat – which fits well with his vision. “I want one sec to be the opposite of all these apps that I’m trying to fight,” he says. “I don’t want the user to look at ads while the intervention is happening, because that would completely destroy the effect.” When you install one sec, you need to give it relatively wide-ranging permissions in your phone operating system necessary for it to interrupt other apps. In the hands of behavioral advertisers, that data could be quite lucrative. But that’s not Riedel’s game: all data is stored on the user’s device. “I want to build the best tool for the user, not suck all the data from the user,” he says. “Most users appreciate that. Because they know the service is in return for money, not in return for data.” Riedel distances himself from the hustler mentality that you often hear from self-help influencers, who sing the benefits of quitting social media in order to focus more on work or side-projects. Still, free from his social media addiction, Riedel says his mental health has improved and he feels more energetic and creative. “I don’t take all the time that I gained back from Instagram, only to work,” he says. “But even if I watch the clouds for 10 minutes instead of scrolling for 10 minutes on Instagram, that helps me to recover, to reassess, to get new inspiration, new creativity and new energy. And then, whatever I’m doing, I just feel more energized and much better in general.” Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/6127981/addictive-algorithms-2022-facebook-instagram/", "https://time.com/6098771/instagram-body-image-teen-girls/"], "sentiment_score": 0.08310182571052138, "subjectivity_score": 0.44007199322416723},

The movie, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, depicts the life of Alan Turing—a mathematician, computer scientist and code breaker known as a key architect of the modern computer and an instrumental figure whose skill for breaking Nazi codes helped the allies win World War II. Despite his genius, Turing was prosecuted in England in 1952 for engaging in a homosexual relationship with a man. In lieu of prison, he was sentenced to take estrogen treatments to reduce his libido, a practice dubbed “chemical castration.” In 1954, he killed himself by cyanide poisoning at the age of 41. The film depicts the Turing’s unjust prosecution and punishment for homosexuality, though slightly inaccurately (for more information, the Guardian did a helpful analysis of the film’s facts). What happened to Turing was not uncommon in the United Kingdom and the United States during his lifetime in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. In the U.S., it was “the worst time to be queer because you are not being ignored, you are actively searched for and persecuted,” said John D’Emilio, a professor of gay and lesbian studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “The nice thing about the movie is that it is calling attention to this bit of history that people don’t know anything about.” MORE: The price of genius In Britain—where America’s own sodomy laws originated—the story begins in 1533, during the reign of Henry the VIII. That year, the Buggery Act made male sex a capital offense in Britain, punishable by death, usually by hanging. That remained the law until 1861, when the sentence was changed from death to prison, usually with hard labor. In 1885, the law was broadened to criminalize “gross indecency” a vague, catch-all term used to prosecute anything considered to be deviant sexual behavior outside of sodomy, mostly between men. In 1895, the playwright Oscar Wilde was convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years of prison and hard labor, about which he penned a poem called “The Balad of Reading Gaol.” During Alan Turing’s life, public concern over the possibility that homosexuals serving in the military or aiding in the war effort could be blackmailed by enemies intensified the stigma of homosexuality in Britain. After Turing was convicted in 1952, the British government took away his security clearance. Turing was exposed after he reported a petty theft to the police, involving his lover. Their relationship was discovered by the police through his reporting of the crime. He pleaded guilty and opted for hormone treatments, known as chemical castration, instead of prison time. He tragically killed himself with cyanide in 1954. The 1950s, was the beginning of the end for Britain’s laws against homosexual sex, as the prosecution of prominent people stoked a public backlash against the laws. In 1954, a well known journalist, Peter Wildeblood was convicted of homosexual acts with two prominent and wealthy men, Lord Montagu and Michael Pitt-Rivers, in a public trial that resulted in prison time for all of the men and public opposition to laws against homosexual sex. The trial lead to the creation of the Wolfenden committee of government representatives, ministers, educators, and psychiatrists, which in 1957, published a report recommending the discontinuation of laws against homosexuality. The report eventually led to the 1967 Sexual Offenses Act, which ended the criminalization of homosexual sex between consenting men over the age of 21 in Britain and Wales. In 1994, the age was lowered to 18, and in 2003, it was lowered to 16, the same age for consenting heterosexual sex. The U.S. history is slightly different from Britain’s. The fervent prosecution of gay sex didn’t start to happen in earnest until the very period during which Turing lived. The U.S. had anti-sodomy laws inherited from the English settlers, but it wasn’t until the late 1930s, 40s and 50s, during a period coinciding with the World Wars and a strong strain of Christian morality, that police in the U.S. made it a priority to enforce laws against homosexuals. As in England, concerns that homosexuals could be blackmailed by Communist spies—an idea popularized by Senator Joe McCarthy—drove some of the fervor against homosexuals during that period. In the U.S.—more so than in Britain, it seems—the period was marked by increased police enforcement of the laws. Police officers went undercover in public parks where homosexuals went to meet each other for sexual encounters, in order to uncover them. It was a period of fear for homosexuals in America unparalleled before or since. “This is the height of what I call the homosexual terror in America,” said William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School and the author of Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America. MORE: TIME reviews The Imitation Game During this same period, Eskridge said, states began to pass laws that allowed courts to institutionalize gay people indefinitely in mental institutions for having “psychotic personalities,” where were experimented on, lobotomized, and given shock therapy. As was the case with Turing, the prosecution of gays also denied the U.S. some very bright minds who, but for their homosexuality, might have been allowed to contribute more to society. In the late 1950’s, Frank Kameny, an astronomer with a Ph.D. from Harvard, was kicked out of the Army Map Service and barred from serving in theUS government because he was a homosexual. “One of geniuses of 20th century, the father of modern computers who helped win World War II, who was a lovely person, was destroyed by the anti homosexual terror,” Eskridge said of Turing.

Benedict’s mother Wanda Ventham advised him to choose a moniker less … cumbersome … for his acting career; his father went by the stage name Timothy Carlton. But the young man must have appreciated the curious loftiness of this word, which comes from Old English and loosely means “stream in a valley.” And after all, the name was his. So he found roles suitable for a Benedict Cumberbatch: men above and apart, like Sherlock Holmes in the BBC series, Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate, Stephen Hawking in a TV movie. Fantasy filmmakers recognized his intimidating radiance and cast him as Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness and the Necromancer and Smaug in the Hobbit movies. Soon he will be Marvel’s Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange. Alan Turing in The Imitation Game may be the actor’s oddest, fullest, most Cumberbatchian character yet. The Cambridge genius who fathered the modern computer, known as the Turing machine–and who presciently asked, “What if only a machine could defeat another machine?”–seems part machine himself. Carrying himself with the hauteur of some creature from an advanced species on its first trip to Earth, he joins the Bletchley Park team charged with breaking the Nazis’ devious Enigma code and airily dismisses the theories of team leader Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode), while defying the orders of Army Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) by going directly to Winston Churchill. A marathoner as well as a mathematician, Turing is the lonely long-distance runner who intellectually laps his colleagues while insisting on making all the crucial decisions. Why? “Because no one else can.” They are merely clever; he is brilliant. And in wartime, when results trump politesse, brilliance wins. On its bright face, The Imitation Game, written by Graham Moore and directed by Morten Tyldum, fits into that cozy genre of tortured-genius biopics that sprout like kudzu just in time for the Oscars. But that’s not fair to the film, which outthinks and outplays other examples of the genre (The King’s Speech, The Theory of Everything) just as Turing outraced those around him. For this is a superhero movie of the mind. Unlike the Marvel troupe, whose skills are physical and endlessly watchable, Turing makes magic in his head. The beautiful wheels spin inside; that’s where he flies. And he defeats the villains of unsolvable equations not with a punch but with a keypunch. The “action” here is Turing tinkering with his machine. Or simply thinking–which, as Cumberbatch portrays it, is adventure of the highest order. The actor doesn’t play Turing so much as inhabit him, bravely and sympathetically but without mediation; that’s your job. He recognizes that this supernal machine had a flaw, or thought it did. Turing’s Achilles heel was his heart, and his shielding his sexuality from his colleagues helps explain his emotional reticence, as the bullying he suffered at school almost justifies the pleasure he takes in being top dog at Bletchley Park. He even proposes marriage to the Enigma team’s one woman, Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), as a cover for homosexual activities that were illegal in Britain throughout his life, and the penalties for which hastened his death. This superhero is really a tragic hero, doomed not by his “crime” but by society’s ignorant prejudice. Critics won’t need a Turing machine to pick one of the most smartly judged, truly feeling movies of the year or its most towering, magnetic performance. And though the star’s achievement should be its own reward, he is sure to receive many prizes this Oscar season. He deserves a Cumberbatch of them.

They discussed Musk’s reasons for starting SpaceX, his thoughts on his various challengers in the new race to the moon, and his predictions for the near-future of human space travel. The interview below has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. (For more of the interview, tune into CBS Sunday Morning, July 21, at 9:00 AM, ET.) TIME: History is usually most viscerally felt by people who lived it. If you lived through World War II, you understand World War II. You came along two years after Apollo 11. And yet space seems to be in your marrow.  Elon Musk: I think Apollo 11 was one of the most inspiring things in all of human history. Arguably the most inspiring thing. And one of the most universally good things in history. The level of inspiration that provided to the people of Earth was incredible. And it certainly inspired me. I’m not sure SpaceX would exist if not for Apollo 11. I kept expecting that we would continue beyond Apollo 11, that we would have a base on the moon, that we would be sending people to Mars. And that by 2019 probably would be sending people to the moons of Jupiter. And I think actually if you ask[ed] most people in 1969 they would have expected that. And here we are in 2019. The U.S. actually does not have the ability to send people even to low-Earth orbit. So year after year, I kept expecting us to exceed Apollo and we didn’t. And it made me sad about the future. And I thought, well at least for me and I think probably for a lot of people you want to have a sense that the future’s gonna be better than the past. And if you don’t have that sense it leads to cynicism, pessimism about the future. Lots of other people who love space felt that same despair and disappointment. I certainly did and yet I didn’t build a space and company and you did. So what was it that made you think, “Yeah this has to be done, and I’m the guy who can do it, or at least one of the guys who can do it”? Well I didn’t think I was one of the guys who could do it. I thought SpaceX would be 90% likely to fail. And the way I actually started out was I was gonna do a philanthropic mission called “Mars Oasis” to land a small greenhouse on the surface of Mars with seeds in dehydrated nutrient gel that would hydrate upon landing. And you’ve have this incredible shot of green plants against a red background. My goal was simply to get the public excited, which would then get Congress excited so that they would appropriate more money and increase NASA’s budget. I was gonna take half the money that I made from PayPal and essentially it would be gone—in order to increase NASA’s budget, and then we’d go to Mars. It could not have been easy getting a home-brew space mission and rocket company off the ground. How did you begin?  I went to Russia a couple of times because I couldn’t afford the American rockets. They were too expensive. Russia was decommissioning a whole bunch of ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles]. So in 2001 and early 2002 I went to Russia to try to buy some decommissioned ICBMs, which sounds crazy, but you know, they’re gonna throw them away anyway. But they kept raising the price on me.  I went to Russia to try to buy some decommissioned ICBMs, which sounds crazy, but you know, they're gonna throw them away anyway.  I also came to realize that even if we doubled NASA’s budget, unless NASA had good options for rocket contractors, they would still not make progress ’cause it would just be more expendable rockets and we’d be at risk of a flags-and-footprints outcome for Mars, which is still better than not going there at all, but not as good as having a base on Mars, a base on the Moon, and ultimately a self sustaining city on Mars. And so I was like ‘okay I gotta try building a rocket company here.’ I thought this was almost certain to fail. In fact, I would not let anyone invest in the company in the beginning. Not because I thought it would turn out well, but because I thought it would fail. If the Elon Musk of 2019 could talk to Wernher Von Braun, Chris Kraft, Gene Kranz and all of the heroes of the 1960s—if you had one piece of advice to give them whether it was technological, spiritual, salesmanship, long-term vision, what would it be? Well, Wernher Von Braun really knew what he was doing. His plans were for reusability. But those plans were stymied. It doesn’t matter how you skin the cat, you just have to get reusability done. It’s so insane the way rockets work today. It would be like if you got a plane and the way you get to your destination is you bail out with a parachute over the city in question and your plane crash lands somewhere. That’s how rockets work today—with the exception of Falcon 9. This is completely bonkers. In order for us to be a multi-planet species we must solve full reusability of rockets. In the absence of that…. It would as though if in the old days if ships were not reusable. The cost of an ocean voyage would be tremendous. And you’d need to have a second ship towed behind you for the return journey. Or you can imagine if airplanes were not reusable, nobody would fly, you know, because airliner costs a couple hundred million dollars. So this is why full and rapid reusability is the holy grail of access to space and is a fundamental step towards it—without which we cannot become a multi planet species. We cannot have a base on the moon or a city on Mars without full and rapid reusability. This is why we’ve been working so hard towards reusability at SpaceX. There are people who argue for taking the same monomaniacal—and I mean that in a good way—focus and creativity that SpaceX brings to the work it does and applying to developing a truly renewable, truly clean power grid. The knock-on effects in terms of saving the species would be easier to see what in the relatively short term. Do you ever think about that in those 3 AM hours?  Well, I think Tesla’s actually made great progress towards a sustainable energy economy. I think for electrification of transport Tesla’s arguably advanced the cores of sustainable transport by 10 years, maybe 20. These are small numbers in the grand scheme of things. But they do matter. If I were to fully allocate myself to Tesla, how much faster could we grow versus if I split my time between SpaceX and Tesla? I think the marginal value is relatively limited. I’d rather have Tesla take a couple years longer and still have SpaceX ’cause I think this is the right balance for the greater good. I wish there was some way to do rockets without burning things. But there isn’t. I mean, Newton’s third law, no way around it. So, you know, balancing what is best for humanity—well, there’s just no other way to do it except rockets. Obviously a question a lot of folks wanna know right now is, when will we start seeing regular crewed runs to the International Space Station on a crewed Dragon? Well, this is both a NASA and a SpaceX readiness thing. So from a SpaceX readiness standpoint, my guess is we’re about six months. But whatever the schedule currently looks like, it’s a bit like Zeno’s paradox. You’re sort of halfway there at any given point in time. And then somehow you get there. So if our schedule currently says about four months, then probably about eight months is correct. If you had to bet your house on it, when would you say the next boot prints show up on the moon? Well, this is gonna sound pretty crazy, but I think we could land on the moon in less than two years. Certainly with an uncrewed vehicle I believe we could land on the moon in two years. So then maybe within a year or two of that we could be sending crew. I would say four years at the outside. And when you say, “We,” do you mean the U.S. or you mean SpaceX? I’m not sure. If it were to take longer to convince NASA and the authorities that we can do it versus just doing it, then we might just do it. It may literally be easier to just land Starship on the moon than try to convince NASA that we can.  It may literally be easier to just land Starship on the moon than try to convince NASA that we can.  Obviously this is a decision that’s out of my hands. But the sheer amount of effort required to convince a large number of skeptical engineers at NASA that we can do it is very high. And not unreasonably so, ’cause they’re like, “Uh, come on. How could this possibly work?” The skepticism…you know, they’d have good reasons for it. But the for sure way to end the skepticism is just do it. Instead of going with the Falcon rockets and Dragon spacecraft you’ve got and saying, “Let’s get ourselves to the moon in three years,” you’re going an even more ambitious step further with, the Super Heavy and Starship. Why do that? Why not say, “We can go now”? Well, I think we could do a repeat of Apollo 11 and a few small missions—you know, send people back to the moon. But the remake’s never as good as the original. We really wanna have a vehicle capable of sending enough payload to the moon or Mars, such that we could have a full lunar base. A permanently occupied lunar base would be incredible. Like we’ve got a permanently occupied base in Antarctica. And it’d be absolutely way cooler to have a science base on the moon. So that’s why we’re trying to build it as fast as possible. You know, I think it’s generally a good idea for a company that is building technology to try to make its own products redundant as quickly as possible. It’s slightly discomforting because we’ve put so much work into Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy and Dragon. But actually the thing we should aspire to do is to render them redundant as quickly as possible. And we’ll put them in the museum. Lastly, there are gonna be feet on the moon. There are gonna be feet on Mars. Could they be yours one day? I would like to go to the moon and Mars. I think that’d be quite fun. But I need to make sure…the overarching goal here is to help make life multi-planetary. This is not some sort of personal quest to go to the moon or to Mars. My sort of philosophical foundation is in line with Douglas Adams, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. What he was essentially saying was, “The universe is the answer, what are the questions?” And if we expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we are better able to understand what questions to ask. We’ll learn more, we’ll become more enlightened. And so we should try to do the things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness. And becoming a multi-planet species and ensuring that we have a sustainable climate on earth, these are very important to that overarching philosophy. And that’s the philosophy I buy into.

From humbling chess grandmaster losses at the hands of mathematically brilliant supercomputers to semantic networks with the linguistic grasp of a four-year-old, one thing seems certain: AI is coming. Here’s what today’s brightest programmers, philosophers and entrepreneurs have said about our terrifying, astonishing future. Altman, who’s working on developing an open-source version of AI that would be available to all rather than the few, believes future iterations could be designed to self-police, working only toward benevolent ends. The 30-year-old computer programmer and president of startup incubator Y Combinator says his “OpenAI” system will surpass human intelligence in a matter of decades, but that the fact that it’s available to anyone (as opposed to locked behind private, proprietary doors) should offset any risks. The 42-year-old director of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute takes a dimmer view of AI. In his 2014 book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, Bostrom warns that AI could quickly turn dark and dispose of humans. The subsequent world would harbor “economic miracles and technological awesomeness, with nobody there to benefit,” like “a Disneyland without children.” The 60-year-old computer software magnate and Microsoft cofounder turned philanthropist views near-future low intelligence AI as a positive labor replacement tool, writing that an AI revolution “should be positive if we manage it well.” But he also worries that the “superintelligent” systems coming a few decades down the road will become “strong enough to be a concern.” He adds that he “[doesn’t] understand why some people are not concerned.” The famed 74-year-old theoretical physicist, author and pioneer of black hole physics believes AI could be both miraculous and catastrophic, calling it (along with several other noteworthy scientists) “the biggest event in human history,” helping wipe out war, disease and poverty. But with its potential to grow so explosively it could wind up “outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand,” Hawkings cautions that it could also potentially be “the last [event in our history], unless we learn how to avoid the risks.” The 69-year-old bestselling author, theoretical physicist and futurist takes a longer, more pragmatic view, calling AI an end-of-the-century problem. He adds that even then, if humanity’s come up with no better methods to constrain rogue AI, it’ll be a matter of putting “a chip in [artificially intelligent robot] brains to shut them off.” The 68-year-old inventor, futurist and director of engineering at Google believes human-level AI will be achieved by 2029. Given the technology’s potential to help find cures for diseases and clean up the environment, he says we have “a moral imperative to realize this promise while controlling the peril.” The outspoken 44-year-old entrepreneur, SpaceX founder and CEO of Tesla Motors has famously called AI “our biggest existential threat,” fretting that it may be tantamount to “summoning the demon.” And he’s deadly serious, adding as a counterintuitive thought (for an entrepreneur, anyway) that he’s “increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish.” Write to Matt Peckham at matt.peckham@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3641921/dont-fear-artificial-intelligence/"], "sentiment_score": 0.07297272444331268, "subjectivity_score": 0.4483355968650087},
{"type": "article", "header": "What if the Web Looked More Like Wikipedia?", "author": "Alex Fitzpatrick", "update_date/publish_date": "January 15, 2021 10:10 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5930061/wikipedia-birthday/", "text": "My first encounter with Wikipedia came in the form of an admonishment: a teacher’s warning we shouldn’t trust anything we read on the site, because anybody could write on it and anybody could edit it. Of course, the first thing any teenager does when they’re told not to do something is exactly that thing, and so began a lifelong fascination with Wikipedia. (Much to the chagrin of my grandfather, who, around the same time, had gifted me the entire Encyclopedia Britannica on CD-ROM; I’m fairly confident those disks never spun, just as many sets of the printed version given with the best of intentions were never opened.) More intriguing than Wikipedia itself was, and remains, the idea at its core: that the Internet can be a place not just for communication and entertainment, but collaboration and truth-seeking. It has rightfully been hailed many times as the pinnacle achievement of the philosophy of the “open web,” which has many definitions, but to me simply means: you can do almost anything here, together, without corporate influence. Today, it’s the open web’s last stand—Apple, Google and Amazon’s decision to ban right-wing darling social media app Parler from their respective platforms and services was absolutely the right choice, but also made abundantly clear that the days of hoping for a truly open web have long since passed. Yet Wikipedia, which celebrates its 20th birthday on Jan. 15, lives on—and it’s not just surviving, but thriving. It’s the fifth most popular website among U.S. internet users, according to web tracking firm Semrush, with more than 15 billion visits every month, underscoring its evolution from distrusted upstart to the most dependable of all places its size on the Internet. Yes, it has its problems—generations of philosophers would scoff at the notion that any single article could possibly represent the entire “truth” of a thing, and it endures constant attacks from vandals attempting to change the historical record. But those assaults are generally sorted out quickly. In part, Wikipedia is trusted because it’s open about what former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld famously called “known unknowns.” On Facebook, Twitter or other social media sites, users often present fiction as fact, and uncertainty as confidence. Wikipedia, conversely, is up front about what it doesn’t know. “Our editing community does a phenomenal job being very transparent about what is known and unknown,” Katherine Maher, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia’s parent organization, told me in mid-December. “You see that in all breaking news articles, where they’ve got a little tag at the top that says, ‘this event is happening in real time, and some information may be changing rapidly.’ And it’s really a flag, it’s a warning to say ‘we don’t know all the facts here.'” That spirit, says Maher, permeates the site and its design. “You see this when Wikipedia says ‘this content is disputed,’ or ‘this article may not be neutral,’ or how it….presents different sides of controversy, so that the reader themselves has the opportunity to say, ‘now that I’ve reviewed this information, what’s the determination that I want to make?'” Wikipedia was already on my mind heading into January after my conversation with Maher. But I really glommed onto it while grappling with last week’s horrific attack on American democracy. The episode can be understood through many valid lenses, including those of racism, anti-Semitism and neo-fascism, given the presence of Confederate battle flags and neo-Nazi regalia among the rioters. But it’s also the most tangible real-world result yet of our current epistemological crisis (following other disturbing episodes, like Pizzagate). Many of the participants in the attempted government coup believe that last year’s presidential election was stolen, thereby justifying their actions—even though that’s a lie ginned up by the President and his allies and repeated verbatim on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube (plus certain cable news channels, of course). You’d be hard pressed, however, to find any of that bunk on Wikipedia; what it has are clear-eyed articles discussing the events as historical phenomena. That got me wondering: why does Wikipedia seem to have a general immunity to bullshit? And can we confer that immunity onto other social media platforms, as if receiving a vaccine? Wikipedia’s most obvious answer to our crisis of truth is moderation. When the social media platforms began to crack down on President Trump and various conspiracy theories after last week’s attack, they were exercising their immense moderation power in a way they’ve been reluctant to do until now. (That change might have something to do with the fact that the end of Trump’s tenure is just days away). But Wikipedia has had a culture of moderation since day one, with contributors and editors—all volunteers—going back and forth on articles until they agree on some form of truth. (In fact, the more contested a given Wikipedia article is, the more accurate its contents are likely to be, says Maher). Social media platforms hire moderators, but their focus is generally on the psychologically traumatizing work of removing illicit content like child pornography, rather than on Wikipedia-style debates sifting fact from fiction. So the work of countering falsehoods on social media falls to journalists, academics and other experts. As valiant as those efforts are, they’re doomed to fail. As I spoke with Maher, it became clear just how focused Wikipedia is on giving its moderators not just the power to do their jobs, but the tools, too. That includes long-standing features like footnotes, citations and changelogs—none of which are available to those attempting to correct falsehoods on social media platforms. Additionally, in my conversation Maher, it became clear that Wikipedia’s product roadmap is built around truth. For example, Maher says longtime editors who have earned the community’s trust now have access to technology that can identify and block or reverse attempts to vandalize pages by sophisticated attackers using multiple Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to make it seem like multiple users are agreeing on a given change, thereby faking community consensus. “This kind of—we call it P.O.V. pushing—is not just around misinformation, it can also be around whitewashing the articles of politicians, or it can be a state-sponsored initiative in order to do reputation management or political point of view pushing,” says Maher. “So we’ve worked with our communities to think about what tools they need to be able to more rapidly address these sorts of issues. The same tools that we use for this are the tools that we use for spam fighting. They’re the same tools that we use for identifying incidents of harassment.” Put another way, Wikipedia can offer the truth because it was (and is still being) built for the truth. It attracts truth-minded volunteers by offering them the tools they need to do their job—a stark comparison to social media sites, where pretty much every new feature (messages! snaps! stories!) are designed to goose engagement, and often make bullshit easier to spread and harder to check. They were built so users could share banal life updates or pictures, their founders never anticipating their products would one day contribute to an attempted subterfuge of American democracy. Their user interfaces aren’t meant for truth, and the business models they have built up around those interfaces—based on hyper-targeted advertising and maximal engagement—can’t possibly accommodate it. You crack down on all the super-engaging bullshit, and your profits go out the window. “Unlike social media platforms, [Wikipedia] editors don’t fight for engagement—the incentives that push content to the extremes on other platforms simply don’t exist on Wikipedia,” say Miles McCain and Sean Gallagher, students performing research with the Stanford Internet Observatory who jointly responded to my questions. “After all, Wikipedia has no incentive to maximize engagement: it’s a non-profit, and not ad-supported.” Social media executives, meanwhile, have long held that they mostly shouldn’t be held accountable for the content posted on their platforms, and that policing that content opens a potentially dangerous Pandora’s box. “Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation,” said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday night, reflecting on his company’s decision to ban Trump. “They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.” As popular as Wikipedia is, its survival is not a given. Like all encyclopedias, it’s dependent on the existence of high-quality primary sources, including journalism—and my industry, for the most part, is not in great shape, especially at the local level. This isn’t just a question of the financial solvency of media outlets. If people don’t trust the sources upon which Wikipedia is based, why should they trust Wikipedia? Maher says the Wikimedia Foundation is cognizant of this, and is working on ways to support the knowledge ecosystem upon which Wikipedia relies. “It does no good for people to highly trust Wikipedia, but then not trust the institutions of the free press or to trust academic inquiry or scientific research,” she says. “All of these things need to have an underlying public confidence in order for us to be able to face them and for people to then have confidence in what’s on Wikipedia. So we are looking at this as a broader ecosystem question and saying, ‘where are the ways in which we sit maybe as a point of introduction to knowledge, but then also, what are our obligations for how we think about how to support this?'” If there’s a lesson to be learned from Wikipedia’s continued success, it’s this: build people the tools to effectively call out bullshit, and, like baseball-playing ghosts emerging from an Iowa cornfield, they will come. But what works for Wikipedia—an old-school Internet labor of love—is unlikely to work for a major corporate power with quarterly goals to meet and a market to appease. Maybe the answer, then, is for us as users to spend less time on Twitter, and more on Wikipedia.

Chow", "update_date/publish_date": "February 5, 2020 2:02 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5774723/ai-music/", "text": "In November, the musician Grimes made a bold prediction. “I feel like we’re in the end of art, human art,” she said on Sean Carroll’s Mindscape podcast. “Once there’s actually AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), they’re gonna be so much better at making art than us.”  Her comments sparked a meltdown on social media. The musician Zola Jesus called Grimes the “voice of silicon fascist privilege.” Majical Cloudz frontman Devon Welsh accused her of taking “the bird’s-eye view of billionaires.” Artificial intelligence has already upended many blue collar jobs across various industries; the possibility that music, a deeply personal and subjective form, could also be optimized was enough to cause widespread alarm.  But there are many musicians who feel that the onset of AI won’t end human art, but spur a new golden era of creativity. Over the past several years, several prominent artists, like Arca, Holly Herndon and Toro y Moi have worked with AI in order to push their music in new and unexpected directions. Meanwhile, a host of musicians and researchers across the world are developing tools to make AI more accessible to artists everywhere. While obstacles like copyright complications and other hurdles have yet to be worked out, musicians working with AI hope that the technology will become a democratizing force and an essential part of everyday musical creation.  “It’s provided me a sense of relief and excitement that not everything has been done — that there’s a wide-open horizon of possibility,” Arca, a producer who’s worked with Kanye West and Björk on groundbreaking albums, told TIME in a phone interview.  Artificial intelligence and music have long been intertwined. Alan Turing, the godfather of computer science, built a machine in 1951 that generated three simple melodies. In the 90s, David Bowie started playing around with a digital lyric randomizer for inspiration. At the same time, a music theory professor trained a computer program to write new compositions in the style of Bach; when an audience listened to its work next to a genuine Bach piece, they couldn’t tell them apart. Progress in AI music field has rapidly accelerated in the past few years, thanks in part to devoted research teams at universities, investments from major tech companies and machine learning conferences like NeurIPS. In 2018, Francois Pachet, a longtime AI music pioneer, spearheaded the first pop album composed with artificial intelligence, Hello, World. Last year, the experimental singer-songwriter Holly Herndon received acclaim for Proto, an album in which she harmonized with an AI version of herself: But while the technology has come a long way, many say that we’re still far from an AI creating hit songs on its own. “AI music is simply not good enough to create a song that you will listen to and be like, ‘I would rather listen to this than Drake,’” says Oleg Stavitsky, the CEO and co-founder of Endel, an app which generates sound environments. Case in point: “Daddy’s Car,” a 2016 AI-penned song meant to mimic the Beatles, is a frustrating jumble of psychedelic rock tropes that fails to come together in a meaningful way.  Perhaps in part due to these limitations, few straight-ahead pop songs are being created by AI. Instead, much more intriguing progress is being made in two seemingly diametrically opposed streams of music: the functional and the experimental.  On one side of the spectrum, AI music has become an answer to a simple demand: more music is needed than ever, thanks to a ballooning number of content creators on streaming and social media platforms. In the early 2010s, the composers Drew Silverstein, Sam Estes, and Michael Hobe were working on music for Hollywood films like The Dark Knight when they found themselves deluged with requests for simple background music for film, TV or video games. “There would be so many of our colleagues who wanted music that they couldn’t afford or didn’t have time for — and they didn’t want to use stock music,” says Silverstein. So the trio created Amper, which allows non-musicians to create music by indicating parameters like genre, mood and tempo. Amper’s music is now used in podcasts, commercials, and videos for companies like Reuters. “Previously, a video editor would search stock music and settle for something sufficient,” Silverstein says. “Now, with Amper, they can say, ‘I know what I want, and in a matter of minutes, I can make it.'” And when the company ran a recent Turing-like test, they found that, just like with the AI-generated Bach composition, consumers couldn’t tell the difference between music composed by humans and that composed by Amper’s AI.  Endel was likewise created to fill a modern need: personalized soundscapes. Stavitsky realized that while people are increasingly plugging into headphones to get them through the day, “there’s no playlist or song that can adapt to the context of whatever’s happening around you,” he says. His app takes several real-time factors into account — including the weather, the listener’s heart rate, physical activity rate, and circadian rhythms — in generating gentle music that’s designed to help people sleep, study or relax. Stavitsky says users have successfully used Endel to combat ADHD, insomnia and tinnitus; a company representative said the app reached one million downloads at the end of January.  Both Amper and Endel turn non-musicians into sonic curators, allowing them to become involved in a process they might have been shut out of due to lack of training or background. This year, Silverstein says, Amper will launch a consumer-friendly interface so that anyone, not just companies, can use it to create songs. “Billions of billions of individuals who might not have been part of the creative class now can be,” he says.  Of course, creating simple ditties or glorified white noise is far different from creating great music. This is one of the main concerns that many have about AI in music: that it could flatten music into functional and generic sounds until every song sounds more or less the same. What if major labels use AI and algorithms to cram simplistic earworms down our aural cavities from now until the end of time?  But musician Claire Evans of the Los Angeles-based electropop band YACHT says that sort of craven optimization already sits at the heart of the music industry: “That algorithm exists and it’s called Dr. Luke,” she says, referring to the once omnipresent producer who creates pop hits through specific formulas. It’s the job of forward-thinking musicians, then, to wield the technology for the exact opposite purpose: to push against standardization and explore uncharted territory they could not have conjured on their own.  For their most recent album Chain Tripping, YACHT trained a machine learning system on their entire catalog of music. After the machine spit out hours of melodies and lyrics based on what it had learned, the band culled through its output and spliced together the most intriguing bits into coherent songs. The result was a jumpy and meandering interpretation of dance pop that was strange to listen to and even stranger to play.  “I think often musicians underestimate how much the way we play is based on our physical experiences and habits,” Evans says. She says it took the band many excruciating hours to learn the new music, because many riffs or chord changes would deviate just slightly from the ones they had relied on for decades. “AI forced us to come up against patterns that have no relationship to comfort. It gave us the skills to break out of our own habits,” she says. The project resulted in the first Grammy nomination of YACHT’s two-decade career, for best immersive audio album.  For the British-Iranian musician Ash Koosha, working with AI ironically led to an emotional breakthrough. He developed an AI pop star, named Yona, that writes songs through generative software. And while many of her lyrics are vague and nonsensical, some of them were shockingly vulnerable. Koosha was especially astounded by the line “The one who loves you sings lonely songs with sad notes.” “Being so blunt and so open — so emotionally naked — is not something most humans can do,” Koosha told TIME. “I wouldn’t be able to be that honest unless something triggers me.”  In Berlin, the hacker duo Dadabots is hard at work creating musical chaos and disorientation with AI’s help. Berlin has become one of the global centers of AI experimentation (Endel is also based there) and Dadabots is currently in the midst of a residency in which they’re workshopping new tools with avant-garde songwriters and running AI-generated death metal livestreams. Co-founder CJ Carr says that AI acts both as a trainer for musicians — “like how a chess AI can help you improve your game,” he says — and a formidable radical creator. Dadabots’ neural networks have spit out ominous whispers, guttural howls, and furiously choppy drum patterns. For Carr, the weirder, the better. “When music is messed up, that’s better for music,” he says. “I want to see expressions and emotions and sounds that have never existed before.”  For other creators, AI is not just a path forward, but also a link to a forgotten past of pre-recorded music. Last summer, a new version of the 2012 cult classic “Jasmine” by Jai Paul appeared online. While the first few bars sound the same as the original, the track gradually begins to mutate, with slippery guitar licks and syncopated hand claps drifting and out. The song continues for as long as you are listening — a taut band seemingly locked into an infinite, infectious jam session.  But the track is AI-generated, a project from London-based company Bronze. Its creators, musicians Lexx and Gwilym Gold and scientist Mick Grierson, hoped to create a piece of technology that would dislodge music from the static and fossilized nature of recordings. “We wanted a system for people to listen to music in the same state it existed in our hands — as a constant, evolving form,” Gold told TIME.  Jai Paul shares a label, XL, with Arca, one of pop music’s foremost transgressors (she worked on Kanye West’s Yeezus, Björk’s Vulnicura and FKA Twigs LP1). When the Venezuelan-born Arca learned about Bronze’s work, she was intrigued about how it could connect live and recorded music in an unprecedented way. “When you publish an album, that’s the way people will hear it forever more. When you play a song live, it’s unpredictable and ephemeral,” she says. “Working with tech like Bronze allows for this third thing. Lexx and I got really excited talking about what it means for the way people can listen to music, and the course of the industry.”  Arca and the Bronze team soon began collaborating on an installation by the French artist Philippe Parreno that currently resides in the newly reopened lobby of New York’s Museum of Modern Art. The music creaks and burbles out of swiveling speakers that seem to move along with you. The output changes with the temperature and crowd density, meaning no two days in the space will be the same. Arca says that listening to the music that she ostensibly composed is a strange and gripping experience. “There’s something freeing about not having to make every single microdecision, but rather, creating an ecosystem where things tend to happen, but never in the order you were imagining them,” she says. “It opens up a world of possibilities.” She says that she has a few new music projects coming this year using Bronze’s technology.  While creators like Arca use AI to push creativity forward, many worry that the technology will displace musicians from their jobs. But Koosha says that this type of fear has accompanied every technological development of the last century. “It reminds me of the fear people had in the 70s — when guitar players started a movement to break any synthesizer they found,” he says. While some guitarists or drummers might have been displaced, a whole generation of home producers arose thanks to the lower barrier to entry, and hip-hop, house music and entire new vocabularies and sonic aesthetics rose to the fore.  And Francois Pachet, the director of Spotify’s Creator Technology Research Lab, says that we’re still very much in the early days of experimentation with AI music. “The amount of music produced by AI is very little compared to the activity on the research side,” he says. “We are still in the very beginning.” When more AI creations are released, there will be inevitable legal battles. Existing copyright laws weren’t written with AI in mind, and are extremely vague about whether the rights to an AI song would be owned by the programmer who created the AI system, the original musician whose works provided the training data, or maybe even the AI itself. Some are worried that a musician would have no legal recourse against a company that trained an AI program to create soundalikes of them, without their permission.  But until those issues arise, musicians around the world are working as hard as they can to get their tools into the hands of as many curious music-makers as possible. “I want to see 14 year old bedroom producers,” Carr says, “inventing music that I can’t even imagine.”  Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/5481899/world-economic-forum-gender-gap/"], "sentiment_score": 0.10228401496164655, "subjectivity_score": 0.429945165945166},

After days of silence, Zuckerberg on Wednesday outlined steps he said would protect users’ information in the future. “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a lengthy Facebook post. “I’ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn’t happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” Facebook is planning to investigate all apps that have had access to users’ data prior to a change the company made in 2014 to limit the information third-party apps could receive, Zuckerberg said. Apps that do not agree to the audit will be banned, and Facebook will alert any users that may have had their information misused. The social media site is also planning to further limit the data that apps currently have access to and remove data access to apps a user hasn’t used in three months. Lastly, Facebook will be adding a tool that will help people understand what apps have access to their information and provide an easy way to revoke that access. Facebook’s privacy crisis was brought to light after it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to user data provided to a Facebook app “thisisyourdigitallife,” created by Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan’s sharing of that information with Cambridge Analytica, a group that claimed to have helped get Trump elected, was a violation of Facebook’s terms of service. The app was downloaded by approximately 300,000 people after it was first created in 2013, according to Zuckerberg. Cambridge Analytica was able to leverage Kogan’s app to get data from 50 million users because thisisyourdigitallife didn’t just access the data of users that downloaded that app, it also grabbed data from users on their friends list. Lawmakers in the United States have called on Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill, and in Britain a parliamentary committee summoned him to answer questions on the matter. Cambridge Analytica reportedly used the information from millions of Facebook users to better target and influence potential voters to support Trump. The company responded to the scandal in a statement denying that the data was used to influence the election. Cambridge Analytica added that all users’ data was deleted after the company learned it was in violation of Facebook’s terms of service. However, the company’s CEO Alexander Nix has been suspended pending an investigation. Zuckerberg also provided a timeline for the events surrounding the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Read Zuckerberg’s full post below: I want to share an update on the Cambridge Analytica situation — including the steps we’ve already taken and our next steps to address this important issue. We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you. I’ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn’t happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it. Here’s a timeline of the events: In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social. Your calendar should be able to show your friends’ birthdays, your maps should show where your friends live, and your address book should show their pictures. To do this, we enabled people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them. In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends’ data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends’ data. In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the data apps could access. Most importantly, apps like Kogan’s could no longer ask for data about a person’s friends unless their friends had also authorized the app. We also required developers to get approval from us before they could request any sensitive data from people. These actions would prevent any app like Kogan’s from being able to access so much data today. In 2015, we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica. It is against our policies for developers to share data without people’s consent, so we immediately banned Kogan’s app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data. They provided these certifications. Last week, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified. We immediately banned them from using any of our services. Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to confirm this. We’re also working with regulators as they investigate what happened. This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that. In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information in this way. But there’s more we need to do and I’ll outline those steps here: First, we will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit. And if we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them and tell everyone affected by those apps. That includes people whose data Kogan misused here as well. Second, we will restrict developers’ data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse. For example, we will remove developers’ access to your data if you haven’t used their app in 3 months. We will reduce the data you give an app when you sign in — to only your name, profile photo, and email address. We’ll require developers to not only get approval but also sign a contract in order to ask anyone for access to their posts or other private data. And we’ll have more changes to share in the next few days. Third, we want to make sure you understand which apps you’ve allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you’ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps’ permissions to your data. We already have a tool to do this in your privacy settings, and now we will put this tool at the top of your News Feed to make sure everyone sees it. Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform. I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I’m responsible for what happens on our platform. I’m serious about doing what it takes to protect our community. While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn’t change what happened in the past. We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward. I want to thank all of you who continue to believe in our mission and work to build this community together. I know it takes longer to fix all these issues than we’d like, but I promise you we’ll work through this and build a better service over the long term.

{"type": "article", "header": "Travel Is Coming Back, and Artificial Intelligence May Be Planning Your Next Flight", "author": "Alana Semuels/Seattle", "update_date/publish_date": "May 25, 2021 1:46 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6050921/artificial-intelligence-air-travel/", "text": "There are dozens of routes that Alaska Airlines Flight 1405 can take from Oklahoma City to Seattle, and dispatcher Brad Ward zeroed in on what he thought was the best one, taking into account weather, wind speeds, and other air traffic. But his new colleague at the Alaska Airlines operations center had other thoughts.  A storm cell near Oklahoma City was likely to turn into a thunderstorm around the time Flight 1405 took off, and the airspace north of Amarillo would be closed for military exercises. Better to reroute, the young colleague said, suggesting an alternative that Ward admitted was safer and more efficient. The entire conversation lasted just seconds and passed without a word being spoken: a red box lit up on Ward’s computer screen when the colleague, an artificial intelligence program he has affectionately nicknamed Algo, had an idea.  “This is the smartest person in the room,” says Ward, a solidly built man with the corner desk who has been a flight dispatcher for 21 years, responsible for planning flight routes and submitting them to air traffic control for approval. He gestures to the program running silently on his computer. “It’s smarter than me.” Read more: Airlines’ Emissions Halved During the Pandemic. Can the Industry Preserve Some of Those Gains? Algo’s formal name is Flyways, and it’s the product of a Silicon Valley company called Airspace Intelligence, which is hoping to make air travel more efficient and safer as airlines try to recover from a year in which the pandemic ravaged the travel industry. The idea of AI setting paths for jets streaking through the skies at hundreds of miles per hour might sound terrifying, but Flyways does not dictate—it advises, and humans always have the final say.  This is a job Ward used to do alone by flipping through tabs on his computer screen and guessing where a flight would be when it encountered rough weather or other conditions. Now he has Algo, who dispenses advice, never gets tired, doesn’t get sick and is always in the office. Its machine learning enables Flyways to spot weather threats and other potential problems before humans are aware of them, which helps dispatchers and pilots avoid stressful last-minute changes. Once, when a government website showing restricted airspace went offline, Algo remembered which areas were usually closed to commercial flights at certain times and planned routes accordingly. For all the fears that artificial intelligence will replace our jobs, the more common application of AI in the workplace today is as a colleague, like Algo is to Ward. It can search CT scans for early signs of lung cancer, alerting radiologists to lesions they may have overlooked. It can come up with millions of possible designs for a chair working within parameters provided by designers. It can analyze an applicant’s body language and voice tone in interviews, speeding up the hiring process. A growing number of workers are interacting with multiple forms of AI as they go about their jobs every day. “A man/machine collaboration will do better than just a man or just a machine,” says Pedro Domingos, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington. Deep Blue, an IBM program, may have beaten Gary Kasparov at chess, he says, but “centaur chess teams,” in which humans worked with AI, beat both humans and machines. “It’s not that people will be out of jobs, it’s that they will use computers to do their jobs more,” Domingos says. The sky is really the big untapped opportunity. Of course, as workers become more productive, companies may need fewer of them doing the same job. Transport aircraft used to have as many as five people in the cockpit in the 1940s; now commercial planes have two. Some workers will have to learn new skills as their jobs change. Companies closed call centers during the pandemic and deployed AI chatbots, for example, in many cases leaving customer service agents to deal with complicated questions that the chatbots couldn’t answer; they were also needed to train and supervise the chatbots. Phillip Buckendorf, the 30-year-old CEO and co-founder of Airspace Intelligence, came up with the idea for Flyways after visiting a flight dispatch center. Like most people, he figured it would look something like Star Trek, with complicated computer systems helping dispatchers guide planes through the skies. Buckendorf instead found that many dispatch centers looked like accounting firms from the 1990s. Dispatchers often relied on paper printouts to see weather forecasts and figured out wind speeds by decoding strings of letters and numbers on a federal website. Buckendorf, a lanky German who had been working for a self-driving car company, liked the idea of applying to planes in flight the same kind of technology that teaches cars to avoid traffic jams or double-parked vehicles. “You have this incredibly dynamic environment where you want to predict— where are you going to be in the airspace? And what does the environment look like? And how do you optimize for that?” says Buckendorf, who camped out at the Alaska Airlines dispatch center in Seattle for months alongside his co-founders, collaborating with dispatchers like Brad Ward to build Flyways.  He approached various airlines with his idea but says Alaska was the quickest to agree to a trial, and in May 2020 it began using Flyways on all of its continental flights for a six-month trial. During that time, the AI found an opportunity to reduce flight times and fuel on 64% of the flights, says Pasha Saleh, Alaska Airlines’ director of strategy and innovation. It cut an average of 5.3 minutes off each Alaska Airlines flight, saving a total of 480,000 gallons of fuel and avoiding 4,600 tons of carbon emissions. (Aircraft fuel consumption varies and has improved over the years, but large jetliners can burn anywhere from 600 to 750 gallons of fuel an hour. According to one study, a person flying on a round-trip trans-Atlantic flight accounted for about 1.6 tons of carbon emissions.)  The airline, which gave TIME an exclusive look at how the system operates from the dispatchers’ and pilots’ point of view, is now rolling out Flyways to all of its flights, including the ones that go to Alaska and Hawaii, and while it would not say how much it pays for the program, the reduced flight times and fuel consumption seen in the trial could translate to millions of dollars in savings in the long run.  In terms of places to improve efficiency, “the sky is really the big untapped opportunity,” says Saleh. On a recent Friday, Alaska Airlines Captain Kat Pullis scrolled through an iPad outside Gate D4 at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, reviewing the route for Flight 1258 to San Francisco. Pullis, who was wearing small airplane stud earrings, wanted to be sure the Airbus 321 she was piloting wasn’t going to encounter bad weather. Flyways, working in tandem with Ward, had found the most efficient route, which would take Pullis west of the Puget Sound, past waypoints ETCHY and PYE near Point Reyes, and into San Francisco from the west. This is just a huge enhancement to what we do. Pullis climbed into the cockpit, a silver shell of panels, switches and levers, and uploaded the route into the plane’s system, using an iPad in a rose-colored case. It’s a far cry from just 10 years ago, when pilots like Pullis dragged around 35-pound suitcases filled with paper flight manuals. Ward texted her a greeting, using the ever-evolving technology that would enable him to stay in touch with Pullis throughout the trip and offer assistance if needed. “This is just a huge enhancement to what we do,” says Ward, whose desk looks out onto a parking garage, a Silver Dollar casino, and the Seattle airport a mile away, where Pullis was preparing for flight. Read more: Millions of Americans Have Lost Jobs in the Pandemic. AI and Robots Are Replacing Them Faster Than Ever Not every human/AI relationship is as harmonious as Ward’s and Algo’s, either. A warehouse worker who is told where to walk and what packages to pick by an AI algorithm may find that AI makes the job more physically grueling and stressful. And assuming that AI will be a good colleague has repercussions. Experts said as early as 2017 that AI could diagnose pneumonia better than a radiologist could, which led to a shortage of radiologists being trained, says Gary Marcus, a NYU professor who co-wrote the book Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust.  Yet that AI software is still years from being deployed on a large scale. Companies that use AI to screen loan or mortgage applications often incorporate bias, making it more expensive for Black and Latino families to get loans. Police departments that use AI for facial recognition have wrongfully arrested Black men when the software mistakenly identified them as suspects. Because humans design AI, they can feed their own biases into the algorithms, such as when an AI recruiting tool designed by Amazon discriminated against female applicants. But AI is here to stay, and an AI colleague or colleagues can be an advantage as pandemic-era cutbacks force employees to take on extra tasks, all the while dealing with the distractions—think Slack, emails, instant messaging and video meetings—of the modern workplace. AI transcribed the interviews I did for this story, replied to emails scheduling those interviews, and alerted me to spelling errors in my draft.  In the transportation industry in particular, automation and AI could help address impending labor shortages; as people venture out of lockdown and air traffic picks up, experts predict a pilot shortage. The trucking industry is already experiencing driver shortages. That’s before drones and unmanned aircraft make the airspace even more crowded, necessitating more dispatchers and air traffic controllers. Each time you board a commercial flight in the U.S., there is a flight dispatcher somewhere who has plotted your route. Commercial airplanes must pass over a number of “waypoints”—essentially geographic coordinates with names like IKPIF or KUJEF—as they go from Point A to Point B. The dispatcher chooses which waypoints a flight should hit, then submits the plan to air traffic controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), who either approve or deny the route. There's no way humans can grasp how to handle 20 or 30 airplanes going into one place at one time. The algorithm from Flyways draws on data from past flights and current and predicted conditions to run through millions of route possibilities, and it reruns the process every few minutes for every flight. A red box lights up on the dispatcher’s screen if Flyways suggests a flight should be rerouted because of weather or safety issues; a green box lights up if a re-route is suggested for fuel efficiency; purple means a flight needs to be routed around restricted airspace. The predictive nature of Flyways can help dispatchers avoid things that they can’t see. If it knows that a storm cell in a geographic area usually grows or moves in a certain direction, it can find a new path before that storm shows up on weather maps. If many pilots have reported turbulence on their flights, it can map that turbulence and route other flights to avoid it.  If it knows that many flights are planning to approach Seattle from the north later in the day, it may suggest approaching the airport from the south to avoid congestion. “There’s no way humans can grasp how to handle 20 or 30 airplanes going into a place at one time,” says Ward, who stands, in khakis and a green polo shirt, in front of the four monitors he uses to do his job. “You can have everyone on what you think is an optimal route, but then you create a traffic jam.” Flyways also shows Ward flights that can be slowed down for “network efficiency,” indicating how making one flight arrive later could help four other flights land earlier. Sometimes, Flyways suggests routes that Ward would never have tried. That’s when his judgement comes in handy. The FAA prefers that most flights from the east coast to the northwest go over Cleveland, for example, because this avoids traffic jams. If Flyways suggests a different route, Ward will often reject it because he knows that the FAA won’t accept it. If Flyways decides a flight can go close to a storm because there’s a strong chance the storm will dissipate, Ward may reject that route as too risky.  Dispatchers accepted 32% of Flyways recommendations during the Alaska Airlines trial period, but that is expected to increase as Flyways memorizes dispatchers’ choices. Algo is already learning to plot more routes over Cleveland. “Humans will always be better at making the decisions. And the computer will always be better at supporting those decisions with good information.” says Ward, a self-described nerd who used to spend countless hours trying to find the best routes for his flights. Read more: Artificial Intelligence Could Help Solve America’s Impending Mental Health Crisis Alaska hopes to eventually use Flyways to figure out which flights have a lot of passengers making connections when they land, and to slow down other flights so that the connecting passengers can land on time. It could eventually tell Ward which planes have passengers transferring from one flight to another, so he can put them at adjoining gates. Alaska has 67 full-time dispatchers, and all are now trained to use Flyways.  Airspace Intelligence says it is actively working with “multiple U.S. airlines” to deploy Flyways in their operations centers. Over time, if AI helps Ward make customers’ flight experiences more pleasant and less expensive, more people will fly, Domingos says, creating the need for more dispatchers. That’s what happened in the banking industry initially when ATMs were introduced. More people started using banks, so more branches were opened. The number of tellers increased, and their jobs evolved as they spent less time doling out cash and more time offering financial advice to customers. Now, the number of bank tellers is falling, but the number of financial advisors is projected to grow over the next decade. AI has long been creeping into airspace. So many parts of piloting an airplane are done by computers that some pilots spend as little as three minutes actually “flying” the plane, says Mary “Missy” Cummings, a Duke professor who directs the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke Robotics and who was one of the Navy’s first female fighter pilots. Manufacturers are talking about designing passenger planes for only one pilot.  As companies add drones and autonomous vehicles to the airspace, artificial intelligence will become more essential, Cummings says. There are already “near-misses” at airports because of heavy traffic, and that’s before drones begin flying at different speeds and levels, she says. “We’ll never be able to integrate unmanned vehicles without automation,” she says.  That doesn’t mean humans won’t be needed, though—in aviation, there are always times when something unexpected like a thunderstorm or a flock of geese requires a human reaction. Besides, passengers want to know there is a human involved who will share their fate if something happens to the plane, says Cummings. There’s a reason it is comforting to walk by the cockpit when you board a plane.  As Captain Pullis prepared to take off for San Francisco, she came on the plane’s loudspeaker, introducing herself and telling the passengers that their flight would be an hour and 33 minutes and they’d be cruising at 33,000 feet.

{"type": "article", "header": "Why Amazon’s $62 Million FTC Labor Settlement Is a Bigger Deal Than the Bezos News", "author": "Abby Vesoulis", "update_date/publish_date": "February 5, 2021 11:42 AM EST | February 4, 2021 5:29 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5936126/amazon-settlement-ftc/", "text": "On Tuesday morning, Amazon unveiled a futuristic Northern Virginia HQ2 campus design. Late that afternoon, the company released its blockbuster Q4 earnings report and simultaneously revealed that its founder Jeff Bezos would end his reign as Chief Executive Officer at the retail behemoth to become the executive chair of its board. But it was the news sandwiched between those announcements that may signal one of the defining challenges ahead for Amazon and its incoming CEO Andy Jassy: the same day, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) disclosed that Amazon would pay nearly $62 million to settle charges that it withheld tips from contracted delivery drivers to help its own bottom line. “In its years-long scheme, Amazon baited drivers with earnings promises, but then siphoned tips and slashed wages, pocketing over $60 million in the process,” FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra tweeted Tuesday. According to the FTC, the independent government agency responsible for consumer protection and antitrust enforcement, Amazon had promised its “Flex” delivery drivers $18-25 in hourly wages and 100% of customer tips. But in 2016, Amazon allegedly lowered the base pay and attempted to hide the fact that it did so by withholding some of the contract workers’ tips to make up the difference from the lower hourly rates. In effect, the agency says, the Flex drivers received less total take-home pay. Amazon settled with the FTC without admitting guilt. The company told TIME it disagrees that the way it reported pay to drivers was “unclear,” and that it added additional clarity in 2019. “[We] are pleased to put this matter behind us,” says spokesperson Rachael Lighty. “Amazon Flex delivery partners play an important role in serving customers every day, which is why they earn among the best in the industry at over $25 per hour on average.” The hefty settlement is emblematic of the growing labor and equity concerns that Amazon has faced in its evolution from the vision Bezos dreamt up 25 years ago in a rented Seattle garage to the sprawling mega-company that has made dozens of acquisitions, boasts a $1.68 trillion market cap, and employs more people than the entire population of Austin, Texas. The company is already managing a changing workforce, threats of unionization in warehouses and ongoing employee safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. As Amazon gets bigger, so will the grievances against it. The fact that Amazon agreed to pay the FTC more than $61.7 million—the full amount the agency alleged the firm stole from the drivers—is unusual, says Jessica Rich, the former Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. Many companies facing sanctions over prohibited practices are struggling financially and try to settle for sums that are less than the alleged amount of damage they did. “There’s often ‘ability to pay’ issues,” says Rich. “There’s not an ‘ability to pay’ issue here. And my guess is that Amazon, once it was caught, was eager to just resolve this.” It’s an insignificant sum when compared to the retail giant’s profits; $62 million is not even 1/100 of the company’s fourth quarter net earnings. But the next alleged infraction could come with more serious consequences, says Rich. If Amazon were to make what the FTC considers “deceptive earnings claims” for a second time, the agency would then have the authority to impose civil penalties as well. Consumers might start to pay attention too—especially if they aren’t distracted by a new CEO or architectural plans. “It’s not just the money,” Rich says of the settlement. “It’s also a black eye for a company that’s been trying to explain to everybody that it treats its workers really well.” Case in point is the unionization battle unfolding at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. In less than one week, the National Labor Relations Board is slated to mail ballots to the warehouse’s roughly 5,800 employees, who will then vote on whether they want to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). A majority of ‘Yes’ votes out of ballots cast would make it the first Amazon warehouse in the country to unionize. Unionization could give these Alabama warehouse employees the opportunity to collectively fight for regular pay raises and have bargaining power when it comes to obligations like mandated overtime shifts. It would also mark a significant shift in power in Amazon’s workforce that could change the underlying dynamics in the company that led to Tuesday’s FTC settlement, experts say. The Amazon ‘Flex’ drivers at the heart of the FTC settlement would not be included in the Bessemer, Alabama union protections; they would have to unionize on their own for that. But union membership could have theoretically protected such ‘Flex’ workers from the tip withholding that the FTC alleged Amazon carried out between 2016 and 2019. “Had there been a union in place, Amazon would not have been able to get away with this as it did,” says Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU. The corporation is pushing back against the Bessemer warehouse’s efforts to unionize. It has put up signs in bathroom stalls, according to the Washington Post, urging employees to consider where their union dues might go. Alabama is a right-to-work state, meaning that employees wouldn’t have to join the union and pay dues if they didn’t want to. Amazon says that unionizing would “impact everyone at the site and it’s important all associates understand what that means for them and their day-to-day life working at Amazon.“ The retailer has also appealed a National Labor Relations Board decision that allows employees to vote on unionization exclusively through mail. Appelbaum, the union president, says the tactic is just one more way Amazon is putting the Bessemer workers’ health at risk during a pandemic that has so far infected more than 460,000 in the state. “You would think that an employer would want to minimize risk towards its workforce. Amazon has taken the opposite [approach] and is maximizing the dangers its employees will face,” says Appelbaum. “The reason they do that is because they feel that they have a better opportunity to intimidate people on their way to a vote if it’s conducted at their own premises.” Lighty, the Amazon spokesperson, tells TIME that Amazon doesn’t believe RWDSU represents the majority of its employees’ views and that Amazon already provides much of what a union would advocate for, including “industry-leading pay, comprehensive benefits from the first day on the job, opportunities for career growth, all while working in a safe, modern work environment.” The COVID-19 pandemic—soon to reach its one-year anniversary of infiltrating U.S. cities and communities—adds extra urgency to questions of unionization and what constitutes a “safe, modern work environment.” Besides matters of pay, a union can require workplace safety standards through a collective bargaining agreement. Warehouse workers at the Bessemer plant have not been immune to the virus’s risks: 218 of the 7,575 employees of Amazon employees and contractors that work at the warehouse tested positive for COVID-19 during a two-week period between late December and early January, according to the Washington Post. According to a February report from the Guardian, Amazon created a “Space Force” to police social distancing protocol between employees at the warehouse, but then didn’t ensure there would be enough space between employees to allow them to follow the protocol. Employees ended up being penalized for getting too close, the Guardian article alleges, even if it wasn’t their fault. The company disagrees that it is impossible for employees to accomplish social distancing at the Bessemer site, which spans more than 855,000 square feet on its ground floor. Amazon says it has implemented staggered shifts and breaks to avoid overcrowding, created satellite break rooms, and started using technology that allows workers to clock in and out via their phones to reduce crowding. As of September, nearly 20,000 frontline U.S. workers at Amazon and its subsidiary Whole Foods had tested positive or were at one point presumed positive for the virus, according to a company blogpost. Lighty says Amazon has invested more than $961 million into personal protective equipment and safety measures in 2020 to prevent more cases. The company also began mandating masks, conducting voluntary on-site COVID-19 testing at hundreds of sites globally, screening for temperatures, and increasing sanitization efforts, among other things. Of course, risks remain. In the early days of the pandemic, Amazon rewarded its warehouse employees for working through those risks by providing them with a $2 per hour hazard pay boost as more and more people relied on Amazon orders rather than braving in-person brick-and-mortar retailers, but that temporary pay bump ended in June. (Lighty did not comment on whether Amazon was considering bringing back hazard pay, but said that the company “shared our appreciation for our frontline employees by providing a special recognition bonus totaling more than $500 million” at the end of 2020.) The pandemic has continued—and so has Amazon’s earnings growth. The report Amazon released Tuesday indicated its net income more than doubled its Q4 earnings from last year, reaching $7.2 billion this year. Its net sales for the year surged 38%.

For a year, he has labored in a sprawling Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, collecting the home office supplies, fleece sweatpants, antibacterial wipes and other pandemic purchases that millions of customers have been adding to their virtual shopping carts since the warehouse opened in March 2020. As a “picker” for the retail giant, it is Richardson’s job to gather the items and put them in a tote where they can be sent for packing and shipping. It’s monotonous, labor-intensive work and Richardson says it has taken a physical toll on his 51-year-old body. “I go in there and give it all I can give them,” he says. “My hands be achy, my legs be sore, I be too tired when I get off to do anything. Sometimes I don’t even eat. That’s how tired I be.” But when he’s not working his 10 hour shifts or picking up mandatory overtime hours as a picker, Richardson is taking on a task that is perhaps even more exhausting: challenging the second largest retail organization in the world—whose founder Jeff Bezos is the richest man on the planet—to a unionization battle that started in his small town and has garnered global attention. It was Richardson, a Black entry-level Amazon employee and father of four who first inquired about unionizing the Bessemer warehouse with the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) in June 2020 after experiences at work left him feeling dehumanized and disposable. After months of organizing and infighting, he will learn whether he was successful in helping to unionize the first Amazon warehouse in the country after the seven-week voting period ends on March 29. The results of the vote will have ramifications far beyond Richardson’s own work life. If the majority of eligible Alabama warehouse workers vote to be represented by RWDSU, it will mark the largest increase of workers gaining union membership in a National Labor Relations Board election since 1991. The outcome of the vote could spur more workers—at Amazon and elsewhere—to seek bargaining power in an economy that expects more output for wages that have not kept up with inflation, and would signify a revitalization of private-sector union membership that has been in steady decline for decades. If the union vote fails, however, the loss may depress attempts to take on a company as large as Amazon in future labor fights. Unlike many unionization battles, the central issue at stake for Amazon and its Bessemer workers isn’t just about money. At Amazon’s 130-plus fulfillment centers across the country, workers make at least $15.30 per hour, plus benefits. The rate is more than twice the federal minimum wage, which is significant in Bessemer, where the median annual income is $18,000. Instead the fight is fundamentally about control: both over the demands on workers’ time and efficiency that have turned Amazon into the digital behemoth it is today, and the workers’ say in negotiating what they get out of that labor that has fueled Amazon’s rise. The first incident that pushed Richardson to try to unionize, he says, began when disorganization at the plant resulted in him and more than a dozen of his colleagues waiting more than half an hour to be assigned a work station. Within a few days, he says, a superior approached him and asked him to sign a slip confirming that he was unproductive during that waiting period. He remembers telling the supervisor: “‘You got to write me up for something y’all didn’t do? That ain’t right. I’m not gonna sign that, because when I came in here, I did my part.'” A few weeks later, he says he was again approached by a superior about another period of time in which he was away from his workstation—something Amazon calls “time off task” or “TOT.” In this instance, the confrontation was over a trip to the restroom that took him approximately 10 minutes. Amazon says that for an employee to be formally disciplined for too much TOT, they would have had to have been away from their work for significant periods of time on a routine basis outside of several pre-allotted breaks, but Richardson tries not to test his boundaries now. “Sometimes if I have to use the bathroom,” he says, “I try to hold it until it is time to go to break.” Amazon says it has every right to monitor employee productivity. “Like most companies, we have performance expectations for every Amazonian—be it corporate employees or fulfillment center associates and we measure actual performance against those expectations,” spokesperson Heather Knox said when asked how much TOT an employee would have to accrue before being penalized. “Associate performance is measured and evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things could impact the ability to meet expectations in any given day or hour.” The company declined to comment on these specific allegations on the record. But for a company like Amazon—which employs roughly 1.3 million people globally, ships millions of packages on any given day, and serves an estimated 126 million U.S. Amazon Prime members—efficiency and productivity aren’t just standards it expects employees to meet, but the very essence of its two-day shipping business model. The performance expectations leave some warehouse workers feeling pressured to work at a breakneck pace or be replaced by a person or machine that can, especially as the company rolls out faster and faster shipping speeds. “I think that one of the things that is clear about this organizing campaign is that the workers’ concerns are more than just merely about their hourly salary,” says Faiz Shakir, the founder of More Perfect Union, a group that helped persuade the Biden Administration to show support for the Bessemer unionization attempt in a two-minute video that has been viewed at least 2.8 million times. “Given the amount of money that [workers] help produce for Amazon, you could certainly argue that they deserve even more [money], however, the fundamental issue at play is that they are people who are treated like machines, they are not treated as humans, and there is no dignity for their labor.” That’s exactly what Richardson says he experiences as an Amazon employee on the ground. “I feel like we a number. We robots. We not human at all. We machines,” he says. As the former union shop steward at a manufacturer for automobile parts, Richardson thinks unionizing could change that. Within days, the country will find out whether he is right. This is not the first time that Amazon employees have tried to organize for better working conditions. But they have never succeeded before. In 2014, a tiny number of technicians and mechanics who maintained order-fulfillment equipment at a distribution center in Middletown, Delaware participated in the first-ever unionization vote at an Amazon warehouse. Unionization failed miserably. Of the 27 workers eligible to cast a ballot, only six voted to be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW). Around the same time, a small group of technicians at a plant in Chester, Virginia approached the IAMAW about organizing their facility just south of Richmond. According to an investigation by the New York Times, nearly 20 out of 30 Chester technicians returned union cards indicating interest in being represented by IAMAW, but union support leveled off after Amazon brought in a human resources team to discuss the potential downsides. In 2016, the Amazon plant settled with the National Labor Relations Board over allegations it had surveilled and threatened employees, according to the Times. Amazon had to post a notice at the Virginia warehouse indicating the company would not intimidate workers who expressed interest in unionizing, but says it is following labor laws. “We were compliant with the NLRA in 2016 when the union withdrew its petition, and as we committed in our notice to employees at that time, we continue to be compliant today,” says spokesperson Knox. This time, the organizing attempt is happening in a conservative state in the Deep South, where all states—including Alabama—have “right-to-work” laws that allow workers to opt out of joining unions or paying union dues in their unionized workplaces. These laws, which 27 states have passed, allow for more employee freedom but can make collective bargaining more difficult. David Madland, a senior fellow at the liberal policy institute Center for American Progress, says these factors make Alabama a surprising place for workers to attempt such a vote. “In the South, the southern power structure has strongly opposed unionization for many, many decades in large part because of the fear of Blacks and whites joining together,” he says. “The fact [that] workers in the South—some of the least powerful—are joining together to potentially stand up to the biggest company, and the richest man in the world, has tremendous significance.” A confluence of extraordinary circumstances has pushed the sleepy southern town of Bessemer—a city of 27,000 people located 16 miles outside of Birmingham—towards the brink of breaking through these barriers. For one, the COVID-19 pandemic has fueled renewed concerns about safety conditions for retail workers and gig employees across the country. In April, hundreds of Amazon employees nationwide publicly protested over safety claims, including that the company failed to distribute enough face masks, didn’t provide all workers with fully paid sick leave, and wasn’t enforcing temperature checks at warehouses like it had promised. As of September, nearly 20,000 frontline U.S. workers at Amazon and its subsidiary Whole Foods had tested positive or were at one point presumed positive for the virus, according to a company blog post. During a two-week period between late December and early January, the company reported that 218 of 7,575 employees and contractors who work at the Bessemer warehouse tested positive for the virus. Amazon says it has invested $11.5 billion to COVID-19 related initiatives in 2020, including more than $1.2 billion on things like temperature checks, masks, gloves, enhanced cleaning, and employee testing. The Bessemer plant has only been open for one year, and during that time the country has also had to grapple with racial equity after several unarmed Black Americans were killed by white police officers and vigilantes, resulting in weeks-long racial justice protests last summer. RWDSU organizers think that momentum in the Black Lives Matter movement over police brutality and social justice has motivated warehouse workers at the Bessemer plant—the vast majority of which are Black—to push for dignity and justice in their working conditions, too. “Many of the workers that we were meeting with to begin the campaign came to the meetings wearing Black Lives Matter t-shirts,” says Adam Obernauer, the director of the retail organizing project at RWDSU. “You can’t separate that time and condition and that [Black Lives Matter] movement from this one.” After accounting for differences among union and non-union populations, Black union workers in the U.S. have wages that are 16% higher than their non-union counterparts, according to a 2016 report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research. But the dire economic circumstances in places like Bessemer give Amazon more power. Even before COVID-19, the poverty rate in Bessemer was 26%, versus the national rate of 11%. Then the pandemic led to 85,000 residents in the surrounding Jefferson County filing unemployment claims between March and August 2020, says Josh Carpenter, the former director of innovation and economic opportunity in Birmingham, which is also part of Jefferson County. This coincided with Amazon moving into town and promising $15.30 starting wages, which created a lot of leverage for Amazon, says Carpenter. “There’s historical job loss—generational job loss—that created desperation for job creation for everybody involved,” he says. “COVID happens and it supercharges that leverage.” J.C. Thompson, a 43-year-old process assistant who supervises employees like Richardson, said the $15 starting salary was a major incentive for him to apply for a job at Amazon. And he says things have only gotten better for him since he started working at the Bessemer plant last April. Within two months of working at the plant, he was promoted. That, combined, with the fact that Amazon offers a shift differential of more than $2 per hour for certain shifts, makes him wonder what he could gain from union membership. “There are situations where unions work well,” he says, “but I’ve never worked at a company like Amazon that offers what they offer.” The work that his team does is “not rocket science,” he adds. “They are scanning it, putting it in the box, taping it up.” But for many others, the initial joy of finding a job during an economic lull seemed to wear off quickly as other problems arose. Since the unionization quest started last summer, more than 3,000 of the 5,800 Bessemer warehouse workers signed cards indicating support for RWDSU to represent them in their fight to be able to collectively negotiate things like wages and safety standards, though an unknown number of those who expressed interest have since left the company. Amazon started holding mandatory informational sessions on unions and created a website warning employees of the potential economic downsides of unionizing, like the dues that union members pay, the argument that unions don’t create job security, and that unions are hard to abolish in a workplace once organized. Efforts to remind employees of union dues extended all over the plant, including in its bathrooms, according to a report from the Washington Post. Employees would close restroom stalls to flyers that read: “Where will your dues go?” (Since Alabama is a right-to-work state, employees would not be obligated to join the union or pay dues.) The anti-union culture has made what some employees initially considered to be a physically taxing workplace to be an emotionally draining one as well. “I go in there every day thinking and hoping I can continue on working through this—that they won’t mess with me, that they won’t fire me,” says Richardson. “Of course, I’m afraid because I need my job like everybody else.” After the voting period ends in Bessemer on Monday, it may take several days for the National Labor Relations Board to count all the ballots. Experts are split on which side will win. Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, doesn’t expect the results to go in RWDSU’s favor. Union membership in the private sector has fallen from 32% in 1960 to merely 6% today. “The threshold, this whole time, to organize a workplace is just the bare majority of 51%,” Edwards says. “Labor unions have tried to organize many private sector workplaces, and they failed over and over.” And few of those organizing attempts were against a company with as many resources as Amazon, either. But there are signals of a union revival, and the Bessemer workers have gained support from prominent national politicians. In February, President Joe Biden released a video in which he referenced the vote in Alabama and said “unions built the middle class” and they “put power in the hands of workers.” Democrats in Congress have also expressed support for the warehouse workers: Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran staunchly pro-union presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020 visited Bessemer to meet with union advocates on Friday, while the Democrat-led House of Representatives recently passed the PRO Act, which would strengthen unions by banning types of employer interference in union elections and allowing unions to override the aspect of right-to-work laws that allows employees to opt out of paying dues in a unionized workplace. (The bill passed in the House with the help of five Republican members, but is unlikely to pass in the Senate.) Public support for labor unions is also widening: According to a September 2020 Gallup report, 65% of Americans approved of labor unions, a high point that hadn’t been reached in nearly two decades. This uptick can partially be attributed to the pandemic, says Rep. Bobby Scott, the chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor who introduced the PRO Act. “It’s a gradual increase in popularity of unions generally, and the desire of people to want to join unions, and the pandemic, where people have noticed that they don’t have an effective way to communicate with their employer about unsafe working conditions,” he says. “I think all of those combined have led to much more interest in new unions.” Taken together, these factors might foretell future unionization attempts at other Amazon warehouses and beyond, whether or not the RWDSU is ultimately successful in Bessemer. “The workers are in motion and the public and political sentiment are more and more supportive of unions than they’ve been in quite some time,” says Madland of Center for American Progress. “I think there’s a chance for this to be a really big moment for the future of labor unions in this country, where a lot of positive factors are coming together that signal this could be the start of a really big growth spurt.” Darryl Richardson hasn’t had much time to think about the national ramifications of his attempt to unionize a single warehouse in Alabama. Between Amazon shifts, union canvassing calls, and interviews with reporters, he’s physically and mentally spent. If the vote goes in his favor, Richardson will finally feel like he can rest. But not before he processes the last year, what he’s attempted, and how it may affect workers nationwide. “I believe I will cry first,” he says. “It be overwhelming.” Write to Abby Vesoulis at abby.vesoulis@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.09583125986163367, "subjectivity_score": 0.39601114617469746},

There are now too many examples where the no rails have resulted in a great damage to society.” Cook, who took over from Steve Jobs as Apple’s CEO in 2011, is one of the most prominent voices in Silicon Valley calling for the government to step in to his industry in order to protect user rights and privacy. In the interview, Cook suggested that U.S. regulators could look to Europe’s passage of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018. “GDPR isn’t ideal,” said Cook. “But GDPR is a step in the right direction.” In light of recent data breaches and foreign election influence through social media, Cook’s view is that the tech industry has no other responsible option but to accept more government oversight, a position he outlined in a recent TIME Ideas piece. “I’m hopeful,” Cook said at the Summit. “We are advocating strongly for regulation — I do not see another path.” Cook also explained Apple’s stance on transparency and money in politics. “We focus on policies, not politics,” Cook said. “Apple doesn’t have a PAC…I refuse to have one because it shouldn’t exist.” The CEO also spoke on Apple’s positions on other issues, like immigration and education, as well as the company’s new emphasis on health-related technology, like the newest Apple Watch, which includes a built-in EKG. “I do think that there will be the day that we will look back and say, ‘Apple’s greatest contribution to mankind was in healthcare’.” Cook also explained the way that Apple thinks about the relationship between people and the devices the company creates. Apple doesn’t want to keep people glued to the phones in their pockets, which is why they have developed tools to help users keep track of the amount of time they spend on their phones, Cook said. “Apple never wanted to maximize user time,” Cook said. “We’ve never been about that. We’re not motivated to do that from a business point of view, and we’re certainly not motivated from a values point of view.” “If you’re looking at a phone more than someone’s eyes, you’re doing the wrong thing,” Cook said. Speaking on those issues, Cook returned to his own perspective on corporate responsibility. He says corporate leaders should do what they think is right, instead of trying to avoid controversy. “I try not to get wrapped up in a pretzel about who we upset,” Cook said. “At the end of the day we’ll be judged more on ‘did we stand up for what we believed in,’ not necessarily, ‘do they agree with it.'” Write to Alejandro de la Garza at alejandro.delagarza@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/5569810/tim-cook-time-100-summit/", "http://time.com/5433499/tim-cook-apple-data-privacy/", "http://time.com/5291529/gdpr-digital-privacy/", "http://time.com/5467781/marriott-data-breach-information/", "http://time.com/5439370/hickton-midterms-election-interference/", "http://time.com/collection-post/5502591/tim-cook-data-privacy/"], "sentiment_score": 0.254887636872931, "subjectivity_score": 0.5096161191749427},

When I was invited to guest-edit this issue, TIME’s second special issue devoted to optimism, it was on a particularly dreary day. The national headlines were what we’ve come to expect: bigotry, poverty, injustice, trauma, trouble. I weighed my own feelings of despair and doubt against the idea of reveling in an experience dedicated to optimism. The choice was easy. I wanted to explore the other side. And so, working on this issue with the stellar team at TIME helped me to remember a simple truth: that prioritizing hope whenever possible is a brave and bold thing to do. In that way, this issue is a gift to me, a necessary reminder to grasp joy with both arms and embrace it like a great love. In this project, we explore not only the idea of optimism but its representation. The literal visibility of the proverbial bright side. To me, that is the job of art. To meet us where we are and to invite us in—to think, to feel, to wonder, to dream, to debate, to laugh, to resist, to roam, to imagine. Art is worthy of our interrogation and is in fact an antidote for our times. For the vital moment comes when we each must understand that the social, political and historical connectedness born of traumatic experiences can and should transform to true, elongated engagement with one another. Engagement not steeped in fear and separation, but in shared knowledge, recognition and contentment. Art instigates all of this. In the issue, we celebrate and suggest ways that one can find inspiration in our present moment through the work of artists who carve a path for us all. Whether a filmmaker or a photographer, an author or an actress, a poet or a painter, these pages are filled with people who use art as a weapon for dynamic optimism. When we pivot from the perils of politics and power to the blade of grass, the note of music, the line of a novel, the expression on the screen, we breathe deeply and are revived. As the gifted theologian Howard Thurman once wrote: “Whatever may be the tensions and the stresses of a particular day, there is always lurking close at hand the trailing beauty of forgotten joy or unremembered peace.” Our goal here is for you to luxuriate in that lurking as we present the idea of optimism, hopeful progress and radical change through the appreciation of art.

{"type": "article", "header": "This AI Software Is ‘Coaching’ Customer Service Workers. Soon It Could Be Bossing You Around, Too", "author": "Alejandro de la Garza", "update_date/publish_date": "July 8, 2019 9:49 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5610094/cogito-ai-artificial-intelligence/", "text": "I’m on the phone with a startup executive roleplaying as a frustrated customer, and a note along with a speedometer icon appears on my computer screen: Speaking slowly — You are speaking slower than usual. Try increasing your speaking pace. I speed up, and the message disappears, only to be replaced with another: Continuous Speaking — Finish your thought. Ask an open-ended question. Later, as the exec struggles to find the date of a made-up transaction, the software I’m using detects the strained note in his voice, and again decides I should intervene. A new message appears, this one accompanied by a pink heart: Empathy Cue — Think about how the customer is feeling. Try to relate. This is Cogito, an artificial intelligence program designed to help customer service workers communicate more clearly, empathize with frustrated callers, and improve their overall performance. Cogito listens to the tone, pitch, word frequency and hundreds of other factors in customer service conversations. When it detects something is wrong — an irritated customer, a call center agent taking too long to respond, or who sounds bored, tired, irritated, rushed or otherwise unpleasant — it displays a notification on the agent’s computer telling them to slow down, speed up, stop talking, start talking or try to sound more sympathetic. Cogito has been rolled out to more than three dozen call centers across the U.S. over the past year, with clients like healthcare giants Humana and MetLife. The company behind the software, Cogito Inc., has raised more than $70 million from sources including Goldman Sachs, OpenView Venture Partners, and Salesforce Ventures (TIME is owned by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Lynne Benioff). “We were 45 people a year ago,” says Cogito CEO Josh Feast, whose company now has 150 employees. “We’re growing really fast.” For anyone who’s spent hours of their lives stuck on the phone with an unhelpful or downright rude customer service agent, Cogito may seem like a godsend. And while it sounds like the digital version of a pushy call center manager, customer service agents using the software who spoke with TIME generally said they found it helpful. But Cogito is indicative of a far bigger and more unsettling trend that extends well beyond call centers: artificial intelligence, once seen as a tool largely under our control, is beginning to tell humans what to do.  The research behind Cogito dates back to at least the early 2000s, when Alex “Sandy” Pentland, a computational social scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was experimenting with ways to track and quantify human interactions. His experiments in what he called “reality mining” included using cell phones to plot the group dynamics of 100 MIT students and faculty, and attaching sensors to office workers to capture non-linguistic “speech features,” which the researchers said correlated to conversational “social signals” like enthusiasm or persuasiveness. Pentland distilled that work in his 2008 book Honest Signals, which argues that humans, as primates, display certain universal vocal quality “signals” removed from our actual words. When understood, he claimed those signals can reveal the underlying dynamics of human interactions — and even predict their outcomes. In 2007, Pentland co-founded Cogito Inc. with Feast, a former consultant and software developer who attended Pentland’s courses while at MIT’s business school. The startup received government funding to experiment with voice analysis software designed to diagnose mental illness in veterans returning from combat. But it soon became apparent that there was other commercial potential in AI software that could determine a speaker’s state of mind from analyzing their voice. The mental health unit was spun off into anther venture, while Cogito focused on developing software for businesses. Feast describes the company’s tech like this: “As primates, we signal our engagement, our level of distress, our attitude to interactions though the way that we interact.” The system examines those signals to determine how well a given interaction is going. When it senses something indicating a less-than-ideal conversation — an extended silence, say — the software gives a customer service agent what Feast calls a “behavioral nudge” telling them to do something differently. Between calls, agents can look at stats on their recent conversations, while managers receive regular assessments of their employees, like an athlete’s stat sheet.  At MetLife, where Cogito has been rolled out to 10 U. S. call centers over the past year, managers say that the program improved first call resolution metrics by 3.5% and customer satisfaction by 13%, and helped agents (who take an average of 700 calls a week) to have more “human” conversations. One employee says that Cogito helped her cut her average call time nearly in half, while another said that it helped her slow down when she was speaking.  “There are always people that are hesitant to change,” says Carrie-Ann Liquore, a former preschool teacher who’s now using Cogito in her role as a MetLife short-term disability case manager. “But the way that is was rolled out to us from our management was constantly reminded that it was a tool … to help us improve.” Of course, in addition to helping workers have more successful calls, Cogito also gives managers vastly expanded insight into — and control over — their employees. Working at a call center has long been about meeting performance goals, and the agents who spoke with TIME seemed unbothered by that enhanced oversight. But the idea may prove more controversial in fields where workers aren’t used to being so closely tracked. For their part, executives using Cogito try to frame it as a helpful tool rather than a surveillance technology. “People don’t see it as big brother,” says Chris Smith, MetLife’s head of global operations. “They see it as another way we can help them do their jobs better.” MetLife managers say Cogito’s performance data doesn’t factor into employee reviews, while Feast says the program’s tracking features aren’t meant for punishing call center workers, but rather to help organizations spot problems and improve quickly. But whether that will remain the case, or hold true at other companies using the software, is less clear. Meredith Whittaker, a distinguished research scientist at New York University and co-director of the AI Now Institute, argues that Cogito could become another example of AI software that’s difficult for people to understand, but ends up having a massive impact on their lives regardless. Firms like HireVue sell AI systems designed to help job recruiters screen applicants through video submissions. Pymetrics makes software to judge applicants based on their performance in video games. Amazon is reported to have a shipping center system that tracks productivity and automatically fires workers if they fall below certain targets. “What [Cogito] appears to do is to allow intensive surveillance of workers and a kind of a priori justification for potentially firing or disciplining workers based on the assessment of a smart machine that neither the worker nor the manager is able to contest or validate,” says Whittaker. And as AI software becomes increasingly advanced, it could make it harder for many to get a job in the first place. AI is on track to displace as many as hundreds of millions of workers over the next decade or two, by some estimates. That number is often debated, but many observers agree that some level of mass employment disruption is inevitable, and it’s unclear what the people affected are supposed to do. Given the pace of advancements in AI recently, it’s not far fetched to imagine a sort of mega-Cogito handling at least basic requests in lieu of human workers. Similar systems, like Google’s Duplex, can already call up restaurants to make reservations on behalf of a user (though it still reportedly needs a bit of human help sometimes.) Cogito scientists say that potential future is still at least a decade away. And today’s call center workers don’t seem concerned. Asked if she ever worries about being replaced by AI, Ashley Moore, a 27-year-old MeLlife total absence management case specialist, laughs. “No, never,” she says. “People want to speak to that real person.” If Cogito actually helps those real people have more empathic conversations with customers, that just might hold true.  According to Cogito’s executives, the company makes “coaching” software. That language perfectly drives home what’s new (and potentially unsettling) about the technology. We’re used to thinking of technology as something we direct. But this AI directs you. And it’s becoming increasingly clear that other types of AI, whether it’s Facebook’s News Feed algorithm or YouTube’s recommendation engine, are similarly driving us in directions we might not otherwise travel.  If AI can “coach” the way we speak, how much more of our lives may soon be shaped by AI input? And what do we really understand about the way that influence works? In the case of Cogito, spending eight hours a day, five days a week under AI direction may have effects beyond how someone speaks at work. Moore, who’s a fan of Cogito’s software, says that after she was using the program for about a year, her boyfriend began noticing a difference in the way she spoke at home. She was speaking more directly in all her conversations, without all the “extra fluff.” She didn’t seem to mind the change. But some might argue the “fluff” is essential — separating human conversations from the binary, efficient communication of machines. Speaking a little differently may seem relatively benign. Yet if AI monitoring and direction becomes more sophisticated and widespread, we may find ourselves less certain of who we really are. Perhaps no one has explored that concept more deeply than Chris Dancy, a heath tech executive turned professional speaker. In 2010, Dancy set out on a profound behavioral experiment, using hundreds of sensors to quantify and track his life and send him streams of notifications coaching him to be healthier, happier, and more productive. He had notifications for sleeping, exercising and avoiding caffeine. When he went to buy groceries, a notification would remind him to strike up a conversation with the cashier. When he spoke too aggressively on conference calls, the lights in his house would automatically dim to remind him to lower his voice.  Five years later, Dancy had lost over a hundred pounds, quit smoking, drinking, and doing drugs, and was making half a million dollars a year. But something was wrong. After years of intense, technologically-enforced change, he began to lose track of his identity. He says he no longer recognized the way he looked or how he spoke. He felt like he was “disappearing,” he says. “Everything was perfect,” Dancy says. “But I wanted to die.” That mysterious artificially intelligent forces are modifying our everyday behavior is far from a new idea. Digital advertisers have long used AI to track prospective customers across the web, cajoling them into clicks and purchases. YouTube’s algorithms, optimized to keep viewers glued to their screens, are prone to lead some people into rabbit holes of makeup tutorials or car crash compilations, and others into webs of increasingly extreme political content — a problem that’s becoming an existential crisis for the site. In the 2016 election, data gleaned from Facebook helped Cambridge Analytica lock onto voters’ individual psychographic profiles in an attempt to turn out the vote for Trump.  The workplace is an obvious testing ground for “coaching” software like Cogito. But like other enterprise software, it could soon spread well beyond call centers and other offices and into our daily lives. At least, that’s the not-too-distant future predicted by techno-philosophers like Andy Clark, who argues we will soon become part of what he calls an “AIome,” or an extended web of external AI processes that will feed us information and come to define our identities. Such a prediction generates some tough questions. Will companies like Google and Facebook, who already have massive power over what billions see on the internet, be able to control even more of our everyday behavior, even offline? And if AI can change how we act down to the very way we speak, how much real agency will any of us have left? At Cogito, some version of Clark’s future may be just around the corner. Skylar Place, Cogito’s chief behavioral scientist, thinks that software to direct all sorts of business calls will be standard within three years. That AI would have insight into both speaking style and conversational content, and be able to notify a worker if they’re speaking off the meeting agenda or automatically mute a serial interrupter. Such software is unlikely to stop at the meeting room, Place says. “There’s a future where it becomes part of our normal day-to-day,” says Place. “In conversations with parents, with spouses, and in preparing for job interviews.” Internally, Cogito already uses an application to coach everyday employee interactions, but it hasn’t rolled it out as a product for other companies. “It’s not that it’s not a technical possibility,” says Feast, the CEO. “It’s just we’re not quite yet sure if the general population is ready for this.” Write to Alejandro de la Garza at alejandro.delagarza@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/collection/life-reinvented/", "https://time.com/5207764/cambridge-analytica-facebook-data/"], "sentiment_score": 0.0484059120197734, "subjectivity_score": 0.4383401389589508},

After all, the new tariffs President Donald Trump slapped on $200 billion of Chinese imports marked a drastic escalation of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. And Beijing may well have wanted its retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods to top the news agenda. But in China, there was a more burning topic: Where on earth is Fan Bingbing? Fan, 37, is China’s best-known actress and the nation’s highest-paid celebrity for four years running, earning a reported $43 million last year. She was featured in TIME’s list of the 100 most influential people in 2017 and has also broken into Hollywood, starring in X-Men: Days of Future Past and Iron Man 3. She was soon to begin filming a spy thriller with Penelope Cruz. But since June, China’s biggest star has not been seen in public. Some speculate Fan is in hiding, but most agree her disappearance seems tied to leaks on Chinese social media in late May of so-called yin yang contracts under her name. In yin yang, one smaller contract is disclosed for tax purposes and a larger one discreetly paid to the star. According to the leak, Fan declared $1.5 million for work on the sequel to her 2003 movie Cell Phone but actually pocketed $7.5 million. A spokesperson for Fan denied tax evasion to Chinese media in May. But the leak prompted Beijing to launch a broad probe into the entertainment industry’s tax practices, promising to tackle violations. Chinese authorities have since said that no actor is allowed to earn more than 70% of the total salary for the entire cast or more than 40% of production costs. On Sept. 6, a state news outlet reported that Fan had “been brought under control” and was “about to receive legal judgment.” But the article was quickly erased. The government has refused to comment on her whereabouts. It’s unclear if she has been charged with a crime. The mystery highlights the opacity of Chinese justice. The use of so-called black jails has been ramped up across China since President Xi Jinping came into power in 2013. In August, a U.N. human rights panel said it had received credible reports that 1 million members of the mostly Muslim ethnic Uighur minority are being held in secret camps for “re-education.” Meanwhile, national and local security officials now have the authority to detain suspects at undisclosed locations for up to six months. Rather than detention and arrest, China is making systematic use of disappearances, says Peter Dahlin, a Swedish human-rights lawyer interrogated for 23 days at a black jail in Beijing in 2016. “The world has never known the numbers of disappearances that we see today in China.” Black jails are not typically discussed by China’s tightly controlled media, but the disappearance of Fan—who has more than 62 million followers on social media site Weibo—has brought national attention to the topic. Many presume Fan is guilty of some crime. Aware that rampant graft threatened the legitimacy of the Communist Party, then-party chairman Xi launched an anticorruption campaign in 2012 to target both “tigers and flies,” or high and low officials. China’s anticorruption watchdog says 1.34 million officials have been punished as of October 2017. Others detect a moral element in the mystery. While the Chinese Communist Party has backed the rapid development of domestic media, it is now clamping down on flourishing popular culture and behavior not aligned with the party’s ideology and socialist values. Fan was a frequent target of criticism, scoring 0% in a recent state-backed social-responsibility ranking of celebrities. It’s unclear if Fan was caught in Beijing’s morality dragnet, but resurgent puritanism is certainly causing trouble across the entertainment industry. Tech giant Tencent, maker of China’s ubiquitous WeChat messaging app, has plummeted $150 billion in value since January after the government stopped approving new gaming apps. Other film, TV and online-content producers have also been left confused as projects get blocked.  Obscure rules about morality combined with a new tax code—nixing longstanding exemptions and incentives, and backdated to January—has left the movie industry “very angry,” says Wang Donghui, a producer in China since 2010. “There’s a lot of smoke. People don’t understand what the Film Bureau or tax departments really mean.” Bankrolling movie productions has also become a way for China’s superrich to get their money out of the country: paying foreign talent more on paper than in reality and depositing the difference in a overseas bank. Industry insiders say big-budget flops keep getting greenlighted because their true purpose is simply moving cash overseas. Indeed, capital flight is a growing threat to the economy; China’s foreign-exchange reserves’ dropped $36.6 billion from January to April. Whatever the true cause of her disappearance, Fan appears the highest-profile victim of Beijing’s attempt to purify what it sees as a runaway, corrupt industry. “Women today are very powerful,” Fan says in one of her last known appearances, an advert for De Beers’ diamonds. “They take control of their work and careers.” But in today’s China, true control belongs to the state alone.

Cambridge Analytica, which worked with both Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaigns, got access to information on Facebook users and their friends through a researcher who misled the social network giant, saying the information he was gathering would be used strictly for academic research, according to recent reports. The trove included information like people’s names, locations, genders and things users have “liked” on Facebook, which a company whistleblower said it planned to use to exploit “the mental vulnerabilities of people” with targeted political messages. Because there would be no other way to get that data through Facebook, which does not sell personal information, it’s hard to put a price tag on how much it’s worth, sources in politics and tech say. While personal data is clearly valuable — especially for advertisers who want to reach specific mailboxes and inboxes — they also raised doubts about whether the profiles would really be that much more helpful than information already for sale in the public square. Tom Bonier, CEO of political data and strategy firm TargetSmart, said that licensing a robust set of “voter files” at a similar scale might cost a company around $500,000. Voter files are snapshots that often combine government records on whether you’re registered to vote with consumer data about things you have bought, as well as educated guesses on your race and income. The commercial data brokers that sell it might even scrape together tidbits like how much you owe on your mortgage or whether you have a hunting license. Voter files are commonly used by campaigns, though in some ways they’re arguably inferior to a Facebook profile: While a voter file might try to assess your religion or level of education based on other known factors, that kind of information is often explicit on social media. And better data is more valuable. Directly collecting information on 50 million people, rather than using models to predict it, would “certainly” run up a bill of millions of dollars, Bonier said. While the revelations have sparked a controversy over how Facebook protects information on its users, Bonier said that the way Cambridge Analytica attained the information is more shocking than the fact that a political firm had personal data about individual U.S. voters. “What should be the most disconcerting component of this is really that breach of trust,” he said. On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a response to the situation after days of silence, acknowledging that users might feel their privacy was compromised. “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” he wrote on the platform. The researcher working for Cambridge Analytica also captured a lot of signals that aren’t in voter files. According to news accounts, the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, developed a Facebook app with a personality quiz. When users opted in, as about 300,000 eventually did, they gave him access to information in their profiles. At the time, circa 2013, Facebook also permitted developers to access information about such users’ friends, which is how the number of profiles in question ballooned into an enormous sampling of U.S. voters. (Facebook has since changed that policy and cut that access off.) Facebook says there was no “data breach.” The problem, the company says, is that Kogan misled the company and users about how he would use the information, improperly sharing the data with a commercial firm. According to reports, Cambridge Analytica paid Kogan’s firm something in the neighborhood of $1 million — covering the costs to do the research as well as incentives for people to take the quiz — to get the information. Cambridge Analytica has denied using the Facebook data, though it has admitting to possessing it. Reports from the New York Times and Guardian detail the firm’s intention to use “likes” to help build algorithms that can predict the personality traits of voters. Armed with that kind of data, a firm could in theory tailor political messages that play on factors like people’s neuroticism or openness. Research has found that “likes” can predict many traits, often with better accuracy than the factors that voter files use to make guesses about people’s attributes. For example, “likes” can predict the race of a Facebook user with 95% accuracy. But when Pew recently did a study on voter files, seeing how accurate data brokers were in their records about individuals, some companies had accuracy rates on race closer to 75%. With education, the rates dipped to 27%. The personality quiz, with added questions about political leanings, had the potential to make connections between “likes” and voters’ mental makeup. In theory, the researchers could assess which “likes” and other attributes are associated with people who scored high on neuroticism questions, for example, and use those correlations to figure out how other people think. But a number of experts have cast doubts on whether this would all add up to something that could really change voter behavior. Antonio Garcia Martinez, a Silicon Valley veteran and former employee of Facebook who writes about these issues for Wired, likens the scheme to creating a “mental horoscope.” Even if a firm knew that a neurotic people could be persuaded to vote for a candidate with a certain type of ad, he says, how would a firm target ads to neurotic people? Would they buy ads on Facebook that target people who tend to “like” things that neurotic people tend to “like”? “It’s too many leaps,” Martinez says. “You can’t target a state of mind on Facebook.” In that case, is all this extra data really worth very little? Martinez argues that 50 million profiles Cambridge Analytica ended up with might actually be more noisy and “less useful” than traditional voter files. Bonier likens it to past fads in politics, like pollsters wanting to draw overblown conclusions about voters based on whether they own a Prius. That’s not to say there aren’t lots of useful signals for companies like his in social media, he says. Political firms might use “social listening,” gathering publicly available information about who has used an #ImWithHer or #MAGA hashtag that can serve the same kind of predictive purpose. And even if it’s not happening today, political operatives could find a way to psychologically profile the masses and use that to sway elections. One of the major lessons of the election was that brilliant, powerful tools like Facebook can be used in ways their founders never intended. “Politics has always been about persuasion and if persuasion goes far enough it can veer into manipulation, playing on people’s greatest fears and desires. And I think the Internet’s making that explicit for the first time,” says Matt Mahan, CEO of Brigade, a startup that is trying to use data analytics to make it easier for people to engage in the political process. “People’s personal preferences and fears and hopes and neuroses, none of those things were ever explicit down to an individual basis,” he says, “before the rise of social media.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.08276200834369152, "subjectivity_score": 0.3978675724715328},

Elon Musk, the pioneer of digital money, private spaceflight and electric cars, has voiced similar concerns. If AI becomes an existential threat, it won’t be the first one. Humanity was introduced to existential risk when I was a child sitting under my desk during the civil-­defense drills of the 1950s. Since then we have encountered comparable specters, like the possibility of a bioterrorist creating a new virus for which humankind has no defense. Technology has always been a double-edged sword, since fire kept us warm but also burned down our villages. The typical dystopian futurist movie has one or two individuals or groups fighting for control of “the AI.” Or we see the AI battling the humans for world domination. But this is not how AI is being integrated into the world today. AI is not in one or two hands; it’s in 1 billion or 2 billion hands. A kid in Africa with a smartphone has more intelligent access to knowledge than the President of the United States had 20 years ago. As AI continues to get smarter, its use will only grow. Virtually every­one’s mental capabilities will be enhanced by it within a decade. We will still have conflicts among groups of people, each enhanced by AI. That is already the case. But we can take some comfort from a profound, exponential decrease in violence, as documented in Steven Pinker’s 2011 book, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined. According to Pinker, although the statistics vary somewhat from location to location, the rate of death in war is down hundredsfold compared with six centuries ago. Since that time, murders have declined tensfold. People are surprised by this. The impression that violence is on the rise results from another trend: exponentially better information about what is wrong with the world—­another development aided by AI. There are strategies we can deploy to keep emerging technologies like AI safe. Consider biotechnology, which is perhaps a couple of decades ahead of AI. A meeting called the Asilomar ­Conference on Recombinant DNA was organized in 1975 to ­assess its potential dangers and devise a strategy to keep the field safe. The resulting guidelines, which have been revised by the industry since then, have worked very well: there have been no significant problems, accidental or intentional, for the past 39 years. We are now seeing major ad­vances in medical treatments reaching clinical practice and thus far none of the anticipated problems. Consideration of ethical guidelines for AI goes back to Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics, which appeared in his short story “Runaround” in 1942, eight years before Alan Turing introduced the field of AI in his 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.” The median view of AI practitioners today is that we are still several decades from achieving human-­level AI. I am more optimistic and put the date at 2029, but either way, we do have time to devise ethical standards. There are efforts at universities and companies to develop AI safety strategies and guidelines, some of which are already in place. Similar to the Asilomar guidelines, one idea is to clearly define the mission of each AI program and to build in encrypted safeguards to prevent unauthorized uses. Ultimately, the most important approach we can take to keep AI safe is to work on our human governance and social institutions. We are already a human-­machine civilization. The best way to avoid destructive conflict in the future is to continue the advance of our social ideals, which has already greatly reduced violence. AI today is advancing the diagnosis of disease, finding cures, developing renewable clean energy, helping to clean up the environment, providing high-­quality education to people all over the world, helping the disabled (including providing Hawking’s voice) and contributing in a myriad of other ways. We have the opportunity in the decades ahead to make major strides in addressing the grand challenges of humanity. AI will be the pivotal technology in achieving this progress. We have a moral imperative to realize this promise while controlling the peril. It won’t be the first time we’ve succeeded in doing this.

Meanwhile Wall Street bankers inflate bubbles in everything from government bonds to Hillary Clinton’s speaking fees. Our economy is broken. If you’re watching me right now, you understand this better than any politician in Washington D.C.  And you know this isn’t the dream we looked forward to. Back when my parents came to America looking for that dream, they found it right here in Cleveland. They brought me here as a one-year-old and this is where I became an American. Opportunity was everywhere. My dad studied engineering at Case Western Reserve University, just down the road from where we are now. Because in 1968, the world’s high tech capital wasn’t just one city: all of America was high tech.  It’s hard to remember this, but our government was once high tech, too. When I moved to Cleveland, defense research was laying the foundations for the internet. The Apollo program was just about to put a man on the moon–and it was Neil Armstrong, from right here in Ohio. The future felt limitless.  But today our government is broken. Our nuclear bases still use floppy disks. Our newest fighter jets can’t even fly in the rain. And it would be kind to say the government’s software works poorly, because much of the time it doesn’t even work at all. That is a staggering decline for the country that completed the Manhattan project. We don’t accept such incompetence in Silicon Valley, and we must not accept it from our government.  Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East. We don’t need to see Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails: her incompetence is in plain sight. She pushed for a war in Libya, and today it’s a training ground for ISIS. On this most important issue Donald Trump is right. It’s time to end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country.  When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union. And we won. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?  Of course, every American has a unique identity. I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all I am proud to be an American. I don’t pretend to agree with every plank in our party’s platform; but fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline, and nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump.  While it is fitting to talk about who we are, today it’s even more important to remember where we came from. For me that is Cleveland, and the bright future it promised.  When Donald Trump asks us to Make America Great Again, he’s not suggesting a return to the past. He’s running to lead us back to that bright future.  Tonight I urge all of my fellow Americans to stand up and vote for Donald Trump.

He believed that one day machines would become so powerful that they would think just like humans. He even devised a test, which he called “the imitation game,” to herald the advent of computers that were indistinguishable from human minds. But as Benedict Cumberbatch’s performance in the new movie The Imitation Game shows, Turing’s heroic and tragic life provides a compelling counter to the concept that there might be no fundamental difference between our minds and machines. As we celebrate the cool inventions that sprouted this year, it’s useful to look back at the most important invention of our age, the computer, which along with its accoutrements, microchips and digital networks is the über innovation from which most subsequent Ubers and innovations were born. But despite the computer’s importance, most of us don’t know who invented it. That’s because, like most innovations of the digital age, it has no single creator, no Bell or Edison or Morse or Watt. Instead, the computer was devised during the early 1940s in a variety of places, from Berlin to the University of Pennsylvania to Iowa State, mainly by collaborative teams. As often seen in the annals of invention, the time was right and the atmosphere charged. The mass manufacture of vacuum tubes for radios paved the way for the creation of electronic digital circuits. That was accompanied by theoretical advances in logic that made circuits more useful. And the march was quickened by the drums of war. As nations armed for conflict, it became clear that computational power was as important as firepower. Which is what makes the Turing story especially compelling. He was the seminal theorist conceptualizing the idea of a universal computer, he was part of the secret team at Bletchley Park, England, that put theory into practice by building machines that broke the German wartime codes, and he framed the most fundamental question of the computer age: Can machines think? Having survived a cold upbringing on the fraying fringe of the British gentry, Turing had a lonely intensity to him, reflected in his love of long-distance running. At boarding school, he realized he was gay. He became infatuated with a fair-haired schoolmate, Christopher Morcom, who died suddenly of tuberculosis. Turing also had a trait, so common among innovators, that was charmingly described by his biographer Andrew Hodges: “Alan was slow to learn that indistinct line that separated initiative from disobedience.” At Cambridge University, Turing became fascinated by the math of quantum physics, which describes how events at the subatomic level are governed by statistical probabilities rather than laws that determine things with certainty. He believed (at least while he was young) that this uncertainty and indeterminacy at the subatomic level permitted humans to exercise free will–a trait that, if it existed, would seem to distinguish them from machines. He had an instinct that there were mathematical statements that were likewise elusive: we could never know whether they were provable or not. One way of framing the issue was to ask whether there was a “mechanical process” that could be used to determine whether a particular logical statement was provable. Turing liked the concept of a “mechanical process.” One day in the summer of 1935, he was out for his usual solitary run and stopped to lie down in a grove of apple trees. He decided to take the notion of a “mechanical process” literally, conjuring up an imaginary machine and applying it to the problem. The “Logical Computing Machine” that Turing envisioned (as a thought experiment, not as a real machine to be built) was simple at first glance, but it could handle, in theory, any mathematical computation. It consisted of an unlimited length of paper tape containing symbols within squares; the machine would be able to read the symbols on the tape and perform certain actions based on a “table of instructions” it had been given. Turing showed that there was no method to determine in advance whether any given instruction table combined with any given set of inputs would lead the machine to arrive at an answer or go into some loop and continue chugging away indefinitely, getting nowhere. This discovery was useful for the development of mathematical theory. But more important was the by-product: Turing’s concept of a Logical Computing Machine, which soon came to be known as a Turing machine. “It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence,” he declared. Turing’s interest was more than theoretical, however. Fascinated by ciphers, Turing enlisted in the British effort to break Germany’s military codes. The secret teams set up shop on the grounds of a Victorian manor house in the drab redbrick town of Bletchley. Turing was assigned to a group tackling the Germans’ Enigma code, which was generated by a portable machine with mechanical rotors and electrical circuits. After every keystroke, it changed the formula for substituting letters. Turing and his team built a machine, called “the bombe,” that exploited subtle weaknesses in the German coding, including the fact that no letter could be enciphered as itself and that there were certain phrases that the Germans used repeatedly. By August 1940, Turing’s team had bombes that could decipher German messages about the deployment of the U-boats that were decimating British supply convoys. The bombe was not a significant advance in computer technology. It was an electromechanical device with relay switches rather than vacuum tubes and electronic circuits. But a subsequent machine produced at Bletchley, known as Colossus, was a major milestone. The need for Colossus arose when the Germans started coding important messages, including orders from Hitler, with a machine that used 12 code wheels of unequal size. To break it would require using lightning-quick electronic circuits. The team in charge was led by Max Newman, who had been Turing’s math don at Cambridge. Turing introduced Newman to the electronics wizard Tommy Flowers, who had devised wondrous vacuum-tube circuits while working for the British telephone system. They realized that the only way to analyze German messages quickly enough was to store one of them in the internal electronic memory of a machine rather than trying to compare two punched paper tapes. This would require 1,500 vacuum tubes. The Bletchley Park managers were skeptical, but the team pushed ahead. By December 1943–after only 11 months–it produced the first Colossus machine. An even bigger version, using 2,400 tubes, was ready by June 1, 1944. The machines helped confirm that Hitler was unaware of the planned D-Day invasion. Turing’s need to hide both his homosexuality and his codebreaking work meant that he often found himself playing his own imitation game, pretending to be things he wasn’t. At one point he proposed marriage to a female colleague (played by Keira Knightley in the new film), but then felt compelled to tell her that he was gay. She was still willing to marry him, but he believed that imitating a straight man would be a sham and decided not to proceed. After the war, Turing turned his attention to an issue that he had wrestled with since his boarding-school friend Christopher Morcom’s death: Did humans have “free will” and consciousness, perhaps even a soul, that made them fundamentally different from a programmed machine? By this time Turing had become skeptical. He was working on machines that could modify their own programs based on information they processed, and he came to believe that this type of machine learning could lead to artificial intelligence. In a 1950 paper, he began with a clear declaration: “I propose to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’ ” With a schoolboy’s sense of fun, he invented his “imitation game,” now generally known as the Turing test, to give empirical meaning to that question. Put a machine and a human in a room, he said, and send in written questions. If you can’t tell which answers are from the machine and which are from the human, then there is no meaningful reason to insist that the machine isn’t “thinking.” A sample interrogation, he wrote, might include the following: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A : Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: [Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer] 105621. Turing did something clever in this example. Careful scrutiny shows that the respondent, after 30 seconds, made a slight mistake in addition. (The correct answer is 105,721.) Is that evidence that the respondent was a human? Perhaps. But then again, maybe it was a machine cagily playing an imitation game. Many objections have been made to Turing’s proposed test. “Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain,” declared a famous brain surgeon, Sir Geoffrey Jefferson. Turing’s response seems somewhat flippant, but it was also subtle: “The comparison is perhaps a little bit unfair because a sonnet written by a machine will be better appreciated by another machine.” There was also the more fundamental objection that even if a machine’s answers were indistinguishable from a human’s, that did not mean it had consciousness and its own intentions, the way human minds do. When the human player of the Turing test uses words, he associates those words with real-world meanings, emotions, experiences, sensations and perceptions. Machines don’t. Without such connections, language is just a game divorced from meaning. This critique of the Turing test remains the most debated topic in cognitive science. Turing gave his own guess as to whether a computer might be able to win his imitation game. “I believe that in about 50 years’ time it will be possible to program computers … so well that an average interrogator will not have more than a 70% chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.” Fooling fewer than a third of interrogators for only five minutes is a pretty low bar. Still, it’s now been more than 60 years, and the machines that enter Turing-test contests are at best engaging in gimmicky conversational gambits. The latest claim for a machine having “passed” the test was especially lame: a Russian program pretended to be a 13-year-old from Ukraine who didn’t speak English well. Even so, it fooled barely a third of the questioners for five minutes, and no one would believe that the program was engaging in true thinking. A new breed of computer processors that mimic the neural networks in the human brain might mean that, in a few more years or decades, there may be machines that appear to learn and think like humans. These latest advances could possibly even lead to a singularity, a term that computer pioneer John von Neumann coined and the futurist Ray Kurzweil and the science-fiction writer Vernor Vinge popularized to describe the moment when computers are not only smarter than humans but also can design themselves to be even supersmarter and will thus no longer need us mortals. In the meantime, most of the exciting new inventions, like those in this issue, will involve watches, devices, social networks and other innovations that connect humans more closely to machines, in intimate partnership, rather than pursuing the mirage of machines that think on their own and try to replace us. The flesh-and-blood complexities of Alan Turing’s life, as well as the very human emotions that drove him, serve as a testament that the distinction between man and machine may be deeper than he surmised. In a 1952 BBC debate with Geoffrey Jefferson, the brain surgeon, this issue of human “appetites, desires, drives, instincts” came up. Man is prey to “sexual urges,” Jefferson repeatedly said, and “may make a fool of himself.” Turing, who was still discreet about his sexuality, kept silent when this topic arose. During the weeks leading up to the broadcast, he had been engaged in a series of actions that were so very human that a machine would have found them incomprehensible. He had recently finished a scientific paper, and he followed it by composing a short story, which was later found among his private papers, about how he planned to celebrate. “It was quite some time now since he had ‘had’ anyone, in fact not since he had met that soldier in Paris last summer,” he wrote. “Now that his paper was finished he might justifiably consider that he had earned another gay man, and he knew where he might find one who might be suitable.” On a street in Manchester, Turing picked up a 19-year-old working-class drifter named Arnold Murray, who moved in with him around the time of the BBC broadcast. When Turing’s home was burglarized, he reported the incident to the police and ended up disclosing his sexual relationship with Murray. Turing was arrested for “gross indecency.” At the trial in March 1952, Turing pleaded guilty, though he made it clear he felt no remorse. He was offered a choice: imprisonment or probation contingent on receiving hormone injections designed to curb his sexual desires, as if he were a chemically controlled machine. He chose the latter, which he endured for a year. Turing at first seemed to take it all in stride, but on June 7, 1954, at age 41, he committed suicide by biting into an apple he had laced with cyanide. He had always been fascinated by the scene in Snow White in which the Wicked Queen dips an apple into a poisonous brew. He was found in his bed with froth around his mouth, cyanide in his system and a half-eaten apple by his side. The imitation game was over. He was human.

On Thursday night in Cleveland Thiel explained his support, but he didn’t mention one thing the two billionaires have in common: disdain for a free press. Both have aggressively used the courts to go after reporters. Trump, who has banned several media organizations from his campaign events, even wants to change libel laws so he can more easily sue his antagonists. So far, though, Thiel is the more effective of the two. Last month, Gawker Media filed for bankruptcy protection thanks to a $140 million invasion-of-privacy lawsuit brought by Hulk Hogan—one of several Thiel has funded. Thiel’s lawyer even threatened a lawsuit over a story about Trump’s hair. Whatever you think of Gawker’s decision to publish a sex tape of an aging wrestler, Thiel’s victory raises a disturbing prospect: that individual billionaires, rather than society at large, will decide what reporting is in the public interest. Tellingly, Thiel has described his campaign as “philanthropic,” even though he has a personal stake in the result. He resents Gawker for outing him as gay and issuing repeated takedowns of his fellow entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. This contempt for an adversarial press has implications that reach far beyond stories about sex tapes or hairpieces. After a critical investigation by Mother Jones, a billionaire named Frank VanderSloot similarly pledged $1 million to support anyone who wants to sue the magazine. The journalist Jane Mayer, after profiling the Koch brothers, discovered that they had hired a private detective to dig into her past, and that a dossier of her supposed plagiarism had been sent to various media outlets. The examples go on. So how do we ensure that journalists keep telling stories that the very rich don’t want told? The only solution is to write more critical stories. The alternative can be observed in countries where billionaires already command outsized power to shape how they’re covered. I witnessed this firsthand as a journalist based in São Paulo. While researching a book about the billionaires of Brazil, I ran afoul of the country’s richest man, Jorge Paulo Lemann, a buyout tycoon who co-owns several American brands: Budweiser, Burger King, Kraft, and Heinz. When I asked his press people hard questions about his campaign donations and use of tax havens, they reacted with indignation, because Lemann is held up as an example of meritocratic success in Brazil. I have yet to see a critical story about him in the local press. Lemann is also said to be unconcerned with his image. And yet my Brazilian publisher soon received a message: He was not happy about my treatment of him. My book contract was canceled not long afterward. The head of the publishing house assured me that Lemann’s reaction had nothing to do with the decision, and to be fair, the editorial board didn’t like my first draft, which they found overly critical of my subjects. But they had previously said they would wait for the final version before deciding. And their official cancellation letter declared, “As far as Jorge Paulo Lemann is concerned, the animosity is definitely scandalous.” I can’t know for sure how much Lemann’s message may have influenced my publisher, but my former editor there conceded, “Of course it’s worrying, because you could be getting into a court battle with someone who has 400 million times the firepower that you do.” Lemann and his partners also own one of Brazil’s largest online retailers. (When I asked for an official response, Lemann’s press people declined to comment.) Pressure from billionaires is rarely so straightforward as Thiel’s campaign against Gawker. Fear of an expensive case can also lead to self-censorship. In Brazil, the unauthorized biography of Lily Safra, a super-rich serial-widow, is banned because of a lawsuit alleging that it defamed a deceased relative. But in the United Kingdom, where Safra has a home, a lawsuit wasn’t even necessary because no publisher was willing to release it in the first place. Libel laws there are especially favorable to a deep-pocketed plaintiff—and if Trump could have his way, they might look similar in the United States. Approached by journalists outside the secretive Bilderberg meeting last month, Thiel compared the public desire for “radical transparency” to the activities of the Stasi in East Germany. In his view, he and his fellow tycoons are private citizens whose decisions should not be scrutinized. Even if they are unelected, however, billionaires often wield much more influence over our lives than the average politician. Facebook, where Thiel is a board member, has become the de facto gatekeeper of much of the news we consume. It’s thanks to a scoop from a Gawker website that we now know Facebook’s selection methods to be far from neutral, sometimes discriminating against conservative sources. It’s no coincidence that Thiel has expressed skepticism in democracy itself. What unites billionaires like him, Trump and Lemann, whatever their national origin, is the idea that they know best what we should know about them.

He had recently finished a scientific paper, and he followed it by composing a short story, which was later found among his private papers, about how he planned to celebrate. “It was quite some time now since he had ‘had’ anyone, in fact not since he had met that soldier in Paris last summer,” he wrote. “Now that his paper was finished he might justifiably consider that he had earned another gay man, and he knew where he might find one who might be suitable.” On a street in Manchester, Turing picked up a 19-year-old working-class drifter named Arnold Murray, who moved in with him around the time of the BBC broadcast. When Turing’s home was burglarized, he reported the incident to the police and ended up disclosing his sexual relationship with Murray. Turing was arrested for “gross indecency.” At the trial in March 1952, Turing pleaded guilty, though he made it clear he felt no remorse. He was offered a choice: imprisonment or probation contingent on receiving hormone injections designed to curb his sexual desires, as if he were a chemically controlled machine. He chose the latter, which he endured for a year. Turing at first seemed to take it all in stride, but on June 7, 1954, at age 41, he committed suicide by biting into an apple he had laced with cyanide. He had always been fascinated by the scene in Snow White in which the Wicked Queen dips an apple into a poisonous brew. He was found in his bed with froth around his mouth, cyanide in his system and a half-eaten apple by his side. The imitation game was over. He was human.

Is That a Bug or a Feature?", "author": "Billy Perrigo", "update_date/publish_date": "September 16, 2021 12:06 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6098771/instagram-body-image-teen-girls/", "text": "The features within Instagram that cause teenage girls to develop negative feelings about their body image may be baked into the very core of the platform, researchers and former employees have said in the wake of new revelations that the company did not disclose what it knew about its impact on young users.  Facebook, which owns Instagram, has known for years that the platform is harmful to the mental health of many teenagers—particularly girls—but has kept internal research about the issue private, according to a Wall Street Journal report published Tuesday. In response to the Journal report, a bipartisan group of Senators said they would launch an investigation into what Facebook knew about Instagram’s effect on teenage users. Instagram said it was proud of the research, and that it is constantly improving how its app works to protect users from harm.  Read more: From Instagram’s Toll on Teens to Unmoderated ‘Elite’ Users, Here’s a Break Down of the Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Revelations But researchers and former Facebook employees say Instagram’s problems may be inherent to the platform and therefore almost impossible to fix. “I think because Instagram is based on images, it is difficult to not make it an appearance-focused environment,” said Jasmine Fardouly, a research fellow at the University of New South Wales in Australia focused on social media’s impact on body image. “We may be able to reduce harm, but there will always be some ways that Instagram is harmful.” Some also point out that Facebook’s interests as a company often conflict with the safety of its users. “We have to acknowledge the broader point that Instagram and other social media apps are designed to keep people using them for as many hours as possible, because that’s how they make the most money,” says Jean Twenge, author of iGen, a book about the first generation who grew up with smartphones and social media. “That means you’re going to have a collision between what’s good for mental health and what’s good for profit.” An internal Instagram presentation from March 2020 seen by the Journal said that when 32% of teenage girls “felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” The Journal also found that Instagram research showed that, among teenage users who reported suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users and 6% of American users traced those feelings to their use of Instagram. Researchers found that young women’s self image was especially badly affected by making comparisons between themselves and what they viewed on the platform. But in Congressional testimony in March 2021, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg indicated to lawmakers that research had shown that social media apps had “positive mental-health benefits” when used to connect with others. According to researchers, platforms like Instagram can contribute to body image issues and depression because humans have an innate desire to compare themselves to others. “People have always wanted to present the best version of themselves to others,” says Fardouly. “It’s just that on social media people often present a very enhanced, unrealistic version of their appearance.” Read more: How Social Media Is a Toxic Mirror But social media apps like Instagram exacerbate that problem for a segment of the population that is already prone to making these comparisons, some experts argue. “[It] could just be that a system that encourages visual sharing unintentionally creates a prestige economy that is detrimental to the vulnerable,” said Samidh Chakrabarti, a former high-ranking Facebook employee focused on fixing the structural issues with the platform, who recently left his role at the company, in a tweet.  That’s an “important distinction” to the assumption that Instagram’s problems stem from simply trying to maximize profit at all costs, Chakrabarti argued, because it points to something deeper, at the very heart of what makes Instagram what it is and “suggests different (and harder) remedies.” Research shows that when users are presented with a more diverse range of appearances, backgrounds, and body shapes and sizes on social media, there can be a positive impact on their mental health and body image, according to Phillippa Diedrichs, a leading body image researcher who said she has carried out paid consulting work for Instagram. Diedrichs said that in her consultations with Instagram, she looked at how the company could “embed some of those findings into the design of the app.” “It’s things like: how do you make it easier for users to find content that can be beneficial for wellbeing, or be directed to that content?” she said in an interview with TIME. “If you notice that users are engaging in behaviors or viewing a lot of content that might be potentially harmful to them, how might you nudge them to say, hey, we’ve noticed that you’re looking at this, you’ve been spending a lot of time looking at this, would you like to look at something else?” The changes, Diedrichs said, are a work in progress and have not yet been launched.  Instagram said in a blog post on Tuesday that its internal research shows social media usage can be beneficial as well as detrimental, and said that it is working on structural changes to its platform to counteract how it contributes to negative body image issues. “One idea we think has promise is finding opportunities to jump in if we see people dwelling on certain types of content,” the blog post said. “From our research, we’re starting to understand the types of content some people feel may contribute to negative social comparison, and we’re exploring ways to prompt them to look at different topics if they’re repeatedly looking at this type of content. We’re cautiously optimistic that these nudges will help point people towards content that inspires and uplifts them, and to a larger extent, will shift the part of Instagram’s culture that focuses on how people look.” A Facebook spokesperson added that other measures the company is considering include allowing users to set reminders that pop up after a period of time they choose, and take a break if they’ve been on the app for a while. Independent researchers said such changes may improve the platform’s worst excesses. “Potentially, if there was more diversity incorporated into those algorithms, it might be helpful,” said Fardouly, who does not have a professional relationship with Instagram. Other stories published by the Wall Street Journal this week revealed that Zuckerberg said he would not approve changes to reduce the spread of false content on Facebook’s News Feed if those changes would also reduce user engagement. The revelation is the latest example of Facebook rejecting or paring back measures that would benefit the safety of users, or the health of democracy more broadly, if they have a negative impact on the company’s profits. There is the added issue that much of the content that can worsen body image perception for young women—such as images of ultrathin swimsuit models—comes from paid advertisements that make up the bulk of Facebook’s income, as opposed to organic content that can be down-ranked in people’s feeds without Facebook taking a direct financial hit. As such, some experts are skeptical that Instagram will ever fundamentally change. “I can’t see how it would have much of an impact to tweak Instagram so that people still spend four hours per day on the app, but an hour on more diverse content,” said Twenge, the author of iGen. “If we’re gonna do any kind of intervention with a teen girl, it’d probably be a lot more productive to tell her: people are making money off of every minute that you spend on this app.” Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/4408374/instagram-anniversary/", "https://time.com/4459153/social-media-body-image/", "https://time.com/6097704/facebook-instagram-wall-street-journal/", "https://time.com/4459153/social-media-body-image/"], "sentiment_score": 0.05390169552669553, "subjectivity_score": 0.3697996031746032},
{"type": "article", "header": "How Addictive Social Media Algorithms Could Finally Face a Reckoning in 2022", "author": "Megan McCluskey", "update_date/publish_date": "January 4, 2022 12:36 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6127981/addictive-algorithms-2022-facebook-instagram/", "text": "In the face of claims that they prioritize profits over people, Facebook and Instagram are under mounting pressure to reform the ways in which their platforms are built to be addictive for users. Experts say this increased scrutiny could signal that the social media industry’s current business model is due for a significant disruption. Often compared to Big Tobacco for the ways in which their products are addictive and profitable but ultimately unhealthy for users, social media’s biggest players are facing growing calls for both accountability and regulatory action. In order to make money, these platforms’ algorithms effectively function to keep users engaged and scrolling through content, and by extension advertisements, for as long as possible. “[These companies] aren’t being held accountable for any of their business practices,” says Sherry Fowler, a professor of practice in information technology and business analytics at North Carolina State University. “I think we’re at the same point [with Big Tech] that we were when Big Tobacco was forced to share the research on how its products were harming individuals. There had to be this mass campaign to inform the public because, at that point, a lot of people didn’t even know that tobacco was addictive. Here we have something that’s just as addictive and we’ve allowed the companies not to have to answer to anybody. Certain industries can’t run rampant without any rules being enforced.” With bipartisan consensus growing that more must be done to combat how social media’s leading platforms drive engagement by employing algorithmic tools that are destructive to individual and societal wellbeing, government intervention seems more inevitable—and imminent—than ever in the year ahead. Bipartisan lawmakers have already introduced a House bill dubbed the Filter Bubble Transparency Act that would require platforms to offer a version of their services where content is not selected by “opaque algorithms” that draw on personal user data to generate recommendations. As Republican Rep. Ken Buck, one of the representatives sponsoring the legislation, told Axios, “Consumers should have the option to engage with internet platforms without being manipulated by secret algorithms driven by user-specific data.” But the question remains: Is real change possible? While concerns over addictive algorithms extend beyond the two platforms owned by Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, internal documents—sometimes referred to as the “Facebook Papers”—leaked in recent months by Facebook product manager turned whistleblower Frances Haugen have shone a spotlight on the harmful effects that Facebook and Instagram specifically can have on users, and especially young users. In her October testimony to a Senate Commerce subcommittee, Haugen said that Facebook’s use of “engagement-based ranking”—an algorithmic system that rewards posts that generate the most likes, comments and shares—and heavy weighting of “meaningful social interactions”—content that generates strong reactions—has resulted in a system that’s amplified divisive content on the platform, fostered hate speech and misinformation, and incited violence. Read more: Why Frances Haugen Is ‘Super Scared’ About Facebook’s Metaverse On Instagram, these mechanisms push children and teens to harmful content that can lead to body image issues, mental health crises and bullying. Internal research leaked by Haugen showed that some of the features that play a key role in Instagram’s success and addictive nature, like the Explore page, which serves users curated posts based on their interests, are among the most harmful to young people. “Aspects of Instagram exacerbate each other to create a perfect storm,” one report read. Meta did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment on potential algorithmic changes. Popular video platforms like TikTok and YouTube have also come under fire for employing algorithmic recommendation systems that can lead viewers down dangerous—and addictive—rabbit holes, with the New York Times reporting in December that a copy of an internal document detailing the four main goals of TikTok’s algorithm was leaked by a source who was “disturbed by the app’s push toward ‘sad’ content that could induce self-harm.” In response to a request for comment, a TikTok spokesperson pointed TIME to a Dec. 16 Newsroom post on the work the platform is doing to safeguard and diversify its For You feed recommendations. “As we continue to develop new strategies to interrupt repetitive patterns, we’re looking at how our system can better vary the kinds of content that may be recommended in a sequence,” the post read. “That’s why we’re testing ways to avoid recommending a series of similar content—such as around extreme dieting or fitness, sadness, or breakups—to protect against viewing too much of a content category that may be fine as a single video but problematic if viewed in clusters.” Still, one of the major challenges posed by regulating these platforms is the continued lack of transparency surrounding their inner workings. “We don’t know a ton about just how bad these networks are, in part, because it’s so hard to research them,” says Ethan Zuckerman, an associate professor of public policy, communication and information at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “We’re relying on Frances Haugen’s leaks rather than doing [independent] research because, in most cases, we can’t get the data that actually tells the story.” When it comes to hate speech, extremism and misinformation, Zuckerman says the algorithm might not even be the most dangerous part of the problem. “I tend to think the algorithm part of the story is overhyped,” he says. “There’s a decent amount of research out there on YouTube—which is a lot easier to study than Facebook, for instance—that suggests the algorithm is really only a small part of the equation and the real problem is people who are looking for hateful or extreme speech on the platform and finding it. Similarly, when you look at some of what’s happened around misinformation and disinformation, there’s some pretty good evidence that it’s not necessarily being algorithmically fed to people, but that people are choosing to join groups in which it’s the currency of the day.” But without the ability to obtain more data, researchers like Zuckerman aren’t able to fully get to the root of these escalating issues. “The very little bits of information that have been made available by companies like Facebook are intriguing, but they’re sort of just hints of what’s actually going on,” he says. “In some cases, it’s more than just the platform would have to give us more data. It’s that we would actually need the ability to go in and audit these platforms in a meaningful way.” Referencing the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal—wherein the political consulting firm harvested the data of at least 87 million Facebook users in order to help elect Donald Trump as president—Zuckerman says that Facebook and other companies rely on user privacy as a defense for not sharing more information. “These companies claim that they can’t be more transparent without violating user privacy,” he says. “Facebook invokes privacy as a way of preventing [third-party] research from taking place. So the barrier to [evaluating how the algorithm actually works] is Facebook will use privacy as an excuse for why meaningful investigation of the platform can’t take place.” However, if Congress were to step in and pass new laws addressing these issues, Zuckerman says it could be a catalyst for real change. “The place where we have the best chance at progress is legislating a certain amount of transparency,” he says. “If we believe as a society that these tools are really powerful and doing damage to us, it makes perfect sense that we would try to audit them so that we can understand what that damage might be.” During Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri’s first-ever appearance before Congress on Dec. 8, several members of the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security took the stance that Instagram’s recent efforts to make the platform safer for young users are “too little, too late” and that the time for self-policing without congressional intervention is over. These remarks seemed to signal that regulatory legislation designed to reign in Facebook, Instagram and other platforms could be on the horizon in the coming year. From Fowler’s perspective, this is the only way that the threats posed by addictive algorithms, as well as other aspects of the Big Tech business model, will begin to be mitigated. “I’m very doubtful that unless they are compelled by law to do something that they will self-correct,” she says. “We’re not going to be able to do anything without Congress acting. We’ve had so many hearings now and it’s quite obvious the companies aren’t going to police themselves. There aren’t any Big Tech players that can regulate the industry because they’re all in it together and they all work exactly the same way. So we must implement laws.” The Justice Against Malicious Algorithms Act, a bill introduced by House Democrats in October, would create an amendment in Section 230—a portion of the Communications Decency Act that protects companies from legal liability for content posted on their platforms—that would hold a company responsible when it “knowingly or recklessly uses an algorithm or other technology to recommend content that materially contributes to physical or severe emotional injury.” However, party divisions combined with the fact that it’s a congressional election year gives Fowler pause over the likeliness of whether there will be any tangible progress made in 2022. “My suggestion is that [politicians] move forward on what they agree on with regard to this topic—specifically in the area of how social media impacts minors,” she says, “and not focus on why they agree, because they have different reasons for coming to a similar conclusion.” Whether Big Tech giants will ever be able to reach a point where they’re truly prioritizing people over profits remains to be seen, but Zuckerman notes that companies like Facebook don’t have a great track record in that regard. “Facebook is a phenomenally profitable company. If they care about protecting users from mis- and disinformation, they have enormous amounts of money to invest in it. Something that’s become very clear from the Facebook Papers is that their systems just aren’t very good and probably have not been very heavily invested in. And that’s the problem that comes up again and again and again with them.” Instead, Zuckerman suggests that a different way of looking at the societal harms caused by social media may be more apt: “At a certain point we have to start asking ourselves the question: Do we want our digital public sphere, the space in which we’re talking about politics and news and the future, to be run by for profit companies? And very lightly regulated for-profit companies at that.” Write to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/6121931/frances-haugen-facebook-whistleblower-profile/", "https://time.com/6100182/instagram-generation-z-mental-health/", "https://time.com/6104157/facebook-testimony-teens-algorithm/", "https://time.com/6104070/facebook-whistleblower-congressional-hearing-takeaways/", "https://time.com/6128706/frances-haugen-metaverse-facebook/", "https://time.com/5205314/facebook-cambridge-analytica-breach/", "https://time.com/6126568/instagram-adam-mosseri-testimony/"], "sentiment_score": 0.10099499315263644, "subjectivity_score": 0.4808107462247586},
{"type": "article", "header": "Millions of Americans Have Lost Jobs in the Pandemic—And Robots and AI Are Replacing Them Faster Than Ever", "author": "Alana Semuels", "update_date/publish_date": "August 6, 2020 6:22 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5876604/machines-jobs-coronavirus/", "text": "For 23 years, Larry Collins worked in a booth on the Carquinez Bridge in the San Francisco Bay Area, collecting tolls. The fare changed over time, from a few bucks to $6, but the basics of the job stayed the same: Collins would make change, answer questions, give directions and greet commuters. “Sometimes, you’re the first person that people see in the morning,” says Collins, “and that human interaction can spark a lot of conversation.” But one day in mid-March, as confirmed cases of the coronavirus were skyrocketing, Collins’ supervisor called and told him not to come into work the next day. The tollbooths were closing to protect the health of drivers and of toll collectors. Going forward, drivers would pay bridge tolls automatically via FasTrak tags mounted on their windshields or would receive bills sent to the address linked to their license plate. Collins’ job was disappearing, as were the jobs of around 185 other toll collectors at bridges in Northern California, all to be replaced by technology. Machines have made jobs obsolete for centuries. The spinning jenny replaced weavers, buttons displaced elevator operators, and the Internet drove travel agencies out of business. One study estimates that about 400,000 jobs were lost to automation in U.S. factories from 1990 to 2007. But the drive to replace humans with machinery is accelerating as companies struggle to avoid workplace infections of COVID-19 and to keep operating costs low. The U.S. shed around 40 million jobs at the peak of the pandemic, and while some have come back, some will never return. One group of economists estimates that 42% of the jobs lost are gone forever. This replacement of humans with machines may pick up more speed in coming months as companies move from survival mode to figuring out how to operate while the pandemic drags on. Robots could replace as many as 2 million more workers in manufacturing alone by 2025, according to a recent paper by economists at MIT and Boston University. “This pandemic has created a very strong incentive to automate the work of human beings,” says Daniel Susskind, a fellow in economics at Balliol College, University of Oxford, and the author of A World Without Work: Technology, Automation and How We Should Respond. “Machines don’t fall ill, they don’t need to isolate to protect peers, they don’t need to take time off work.” As with so much of the pandemic, this new wave of automation will be harder on people of color like Collins, who is Black, and on low-wage workers. Many Black and Latino Americans are cashiers, food-service employees and customer-service representatives, which are among the 15 jobs most threatened by automation, according to McKinsey. Even before the pandemic, the global consulting company estimated that automation could displace 132,000 Black workers in the U.S. by 2030. The deployment of robots as a response to the coronavirus was rapid. They were suddenly cleaning floors at airports and taking people’s temperatures. Hospitals and universities deployed Sally, a salad-making robot created by tech company Chowbotics, to replace dining-hall employees; malls and stadiums bought Knightscope security-guard robots to patrol empty real estate; companies that manufacture in-demand supplies like hospital beds and cotton swabs turned to industrial robot supplier Yaskawa America to help increase production. Companies closed call centers employing human customer-service agents and turned to chatbots created by technology company LivePerson or to AI platform Watson Assistant. “I really think this is a new normal–the pandemic accelerated what was going to happen anyway,” says Rob Thomas, senior vice president of cloud and data platform at IBM, which deploys Watson. Roughly 100 new clients started using the software from March to June. In theory, automation and artificial intelligence should free humans from dangerous or boring tasks so they can take on more intellectually stimulating assignments, making companies more productive and raising worker wages. And in the past, technology was deployed piecemeal, giving employees time to transition into new roles. Those who lost jobs could seek retraining, perhaps using severance pay or unemployment benefits to find work in another field. This time the change was abrupt as employers, worried about COVID-19 or under sudden lockdown orders, rushed to replace workers with machines or software. There was no time to retrain. Companies worried about their bottom line cut workers loose instead, and these workers were left on their own to find ways of mastering new skills. They found few options. In the past, the U.S. responded to technological change by investing in education. When automation fundamentally changed farm jobs in the late 1800s and the 1900s, states expanded access to public schools. Access to college expanded after World War II with the GI Bill, which sent 7.8 million veterans to school from 1944 to 1956. But since then, U.S. investment in education has stalled, putting the burden on workers to pay for it themselves. And the idea of education in the U.S. still focuses on college for young workers rather than on retraining employees. The country spends 0.1% of GDP to help workers navigate job transitions, less than half what it spent 30 years ago. “The real automation problem isn’t so much a robot apocalypse,” says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “It is business as usual of people needing to get retraining, and they really can’t get it in an accessible, efficient, well-informed, data-driven way.” This means that tens of thousands of Americans who lost jobs during the pandemic may be unemployed for years or, in Collins’ case, for good. Though he has access to retraining funding through his union contract, “I’m too old to think about doing some other job,” says Collins, who is 63 and planning on taking early retirement. “I just want to go back to what I was doing.” Check into a hotel today, and a mechanical butler designed by robotics company Savioke might roll down the hall to deliver towels and toothbrushes. (“No tip required,” Savioke notes on its website.) Robots have been deployed during the pandemic to meet guests at their rooms with newly disinfected keys. A bricklaying robot can lay more than 3,000 bricks in an eight-hour shift, up to 10 times what a human can do. Robots can plant seeds and harvest crops, separate breastbones and carcasses in slaughterhouses, pack pallets of food in processing facilities. That doesn’t mean they’re taking everyone’s jobs. For centuries, humans from weavers to mill workers have worried that advances in technology would create a world without work, and that’s never proved true. ATMs did not immediately decrease the number of bank tellers, for instance. They actually led to more teller jobs as consumers, lured by the convenience of cash machines, began visiting banks more often. Banks opened more branches and hired tellers to handle tasks that are beyond the capacity of ATMs. Without technological advancement, much of the American workforce would be toiling away on farms, which accounted for 31% of U.S. jobs in 1910 and now account for less than 1%. But in the past, when automation eliminated jobs, companies created new ones to meet their needs. Manufacturers that were able to produce more goods using machines, for example, needed clerks to ship the goods and marketers to reach additional customers. Now, as automation lets companies do more with fewer people, successful companies don’t need as many workers. The most valuable company in the U.S. in 1964, AT&T, had 758,611 employees; the most valuable company today, Apple, has around 137,000 employees. Though today’s big companies make billions of dollars, they share that income with fewer employees, and more of their profit goes to shareholders. “Look at the business model of Google, Facebook, Netflix. They’re not in the business of creating new tasks for humans,” says Daron Acemoglu, an MIT economist who studies automation and jobs. The U.S. government incentivizes companies to automate, he says, by giving tax breaks for buying machinery and software. A business that pays a worker $100 pays $30 in taxes, but a business that spends $100 on equipment pays about $3 in taxes, he notes. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered taxes on purchases so much that “you can actually make money buying equipment,” Acemoglu says. In addition, artificial intelligence is becoming more adept at jobs that once were the purview of humans, making it harder for humans to stay ahead of machines. JPMorgan says it now has AI reviewing commercial-loan agreements, completing in seconds what used to take 360,000 hours of lawyers’ time over the course of a year. In May, amid plunging advertising revenue, Microsoft laid off dozens of journalists at MSN and its Microsoft News service, replacing them with AI that can scan and process content. Radio group iHeartMedia has laid off dozens of DJs to take advantage of its investments in technology and AI. I got help transcribing interviews for this story using Otter.ai, an AI-based transcription service. A few years ago, I might have paid $1 a minute for humans to do the same thing. These advances make AI an easy choice for companies scrambling to cope during the pandemic. Municipalities that had to close their recycling facilities, where humans worked in close quarters, are using AI-assisted robots to sort through tons of plastic, paper and glass. AMP Robotics, the company that makes these robots, says inquiries from potential customers increased at least fivefold from March to June. Last year, 35 recycling facilities used AMP Robotics, says AMP spokesman Chris Wirth; by the end of 2020, nearly 100 will. RDS Virginia, a recycling company in Virginia, purchased four AMP robots in 2019 for its Roanoke facility, deploying them on assembly lines to ensure the paper and plastic streams were free of misplaced materials. The robots could work around the clock, didn’t take bathroom breaks and didn’t require safety training, says Joe Benedetto, the company’s president. When the coronavirus hit, robots took over quality control as humans were pulled off assembly lines and given tasks that kept them at a safe distance from one another. Benedetto breathes easier knowing he won’t have to raise the robots’ pay to meet the minimum wage. He’s already thinking about where else he can deploy them. “There are a few reasons I prefer machinery,” Benedetto says. “For one thing, as long as you maintain it, it’s there every day to work.” Companies deploying automation and AI say the technology allows them to create new jobs. But the number of new jobs is often minuscule compared with the number of jobs lost. LivePerson, which designs conversational software, could enable a company to take a 1,000-person call center and run it with 100 people plus chatbots, says CEO Rob LoCascio. A bot can respond to 10,000 queries in an hour, LoCascio says; an efficient call-center rep can answer six. LivePerson saw a fourfold increase in demand in March as companies closed call centers, LoCascio says. “What happened was the contact-center representatives went home, and a lot of them can’t work from home,” he says. Some surprising businesses are embracing automation. David’s Bridal, which sells wedding gowns and other formal wear in about 300 stores across North America and the U.K., set up a chatbot called Zoey through LivePerson last year. When the pandemic forced David’s Bridal to close its stores, Zoey helped manage customer inquiries flooding the company’s call centers, says Holly Carroll, vice president of the customer-service and contact center. Without a bot, “we would have been dead in the water,” Carroll says. David’s Bridal now spends 35% less on call centers and can handle three times more messages through its chatbot than it can through voice or email. (Zoey may be cheaper than a human, but it is not infallible. Via text, Zoey promised to connect me to a virtual stylist, but I never heard back from it or the company.) Many organizations will likely look to technology as they face budget cuts and need to reduce staff. “I don’t see us going back to the staffing levels we were at prior to COVID,” says Brian Pokorny, the director of information technologies for Otsego County in New York State, who has cut 10% of his staff because of pandemic-related budget issues. “So we need to look at things like AI to streamline government services and make us more efficient.” Pokorny used a free trial from IBM’s Watson Assistant early in the pandemic and set up an AI-powered web chat to answer questions from the public, like whether the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, the county seat, had reopened. (It had, as of June 26, with limited capacity.) Now, Watson can answer 75% of the questions people ask, and Otsego County has started paying for the service, which Pokorny says costs “pennies” per conversation. Though the county now uses AI just for online chats, it plans to deploy a Watson virtual assistant that can answer phone calls. Around 36 states have deployed chatbots to respond to questions about the pandemic and available government services, according to the National Association of State Chief Information Officers. IBM and LivePerson say that by creating AI, they’re freeing up humans to do more sophisticated tasks. Companies that contract with LivePerson still need “bot builders” to help teach the AI how to answer questions, and call-center agents see their pay increase by about 15% when they become bot builders, LoCascio says. “We can look at it like there’s going to be this massive job loss, or we can look at it that people get moved into different places and positions in the world to better their lives,” LoCascio says. But companies will need far fewer bot builders than call-center agents, and mobility is not always an option, especially for workers without college degrees or whose employers do not offer retraining. Non-union workers are especially vulnerable. Larry Collins and his colleagues, represented by SEIU Local 1000, were fortunate: they’re being paid their full salaries for the foreseeable future in exchange for taking 32 hours a week of online classes in computer skills, accounting, entrepreneurship and other fields. (Some might even get their jobs back, albeit temporarily, as the state upgrades its systems.) But just 11.6 % of American workers were represented by a union in 2019. Yvonne R. Walker, the union president, says most non-union workers don’t get this kind of assistance. “Companies out there don’t provide employee training and upskilling–they don’t see it as a good investment,” Walker says. “Unless workers have a union thinking about these things, the workers get left behind.” In Sweden, employers pay into private funds that help workers get retrained; Singapore’s SkillsFuture program reimburses citizens up to 500 Singapore dollars (about $362 in U.S. currency) for approved retraining courses. But in the U.S., the most robust retraining programs are for workers whose jobs are sent overseas or otherwise lost because of trade issues. A few states have started promising to pay community-college tuition for adult learners who seek retraining; the Tennessee Reconnect program pays for adults over 25 without college degrees to get certificates, associate’s degrees and technical diplomas. But a similar program in Michigan is in jeopardy as states struggle with budget issues, says Michelle Miller-Adams, a researcher at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. House and Senate Democrats introduced a $15 billion workforce-retraining bill in early May, but it hasn’t gained much traction with Republicans, who prefer to encourage retraining by giving tax credits. The federal funds that exist come with restrictions. Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for education, can’t be used for nontraditional programs like boot camps or a 170-hour EMT certification. Local jobless centers, which receive federal funds, spend an average of $3,500 per person on retraining, but they usually run out of money early in a calendar year because of limited funding, says Ayobami Olugbemiga, press secretary at the National Skills Coalition. Even if federal funding were widely available, the surge of people who need retraining would be more than universities can handle, says Gabe Dalporto, the CEO of Udacity, which offers online courses in programming, data science, AI and more. “A billion people will lose their jobs over the next 10 years due to AI, and if anything, COVID has accelerated that by about nine years,” says Dalporto. “If you tried to reskill a billion people in the university system, you would break the university system.” Dalporto says the coronavirus should be a wake-up call for the federal government to rethink how it funds education. “We have this model where we want to dump huge amounts of capital into very slow, noncareer-specific education,” Dalporto says. “If you just repurposed 10% of that, you could retrain 3 million people in about six months.” Online education providers say they can provide retraining and upskilling on workers’ own timelines, and for less money than traditional schools. Coursera offers six-month courses for $39 to $79 a month that provide students with certifications needed for a variety of jobs, says CEO Jeff Maggioncalda. Once they’ve landed a job, they can then pursue a college degree online, he says. “This idea that you get job skills first, get the job, then get your college degree online while you’re working, I think for a lot of people will be more economically effective,” he says. In April, Coursera launched a Workforce Recovery Initiative that allows the unemployed in some states and other countries, including Colombia and Singapore, to learn for free until the end of the year. Online learning providers can offer relatively inexpensive upskilling options because they don’t have guidance counselors, classrooms and other features of brick-and-mortar schools. But there could be more of a role for employers to provide those support systems going forward. Dalporto, who calls the wave of automation during COVID-19 “our economic Pearl Harbor,” argues that the government should provide a tax credit of $2,500 per upskilled worker to companies that provide retraining. He also suggests that company severance packages include $1,500 in retraining credits. Some employers are turning to Guild Education, which works with employers to subsidize upskilling. A program it launched in May lets companies pay a fee to have Guild assist laid-off workers in finding new jobs. Employers see this as a way to create loyalty among these former employees, says Rachel Carlson, the CEO of Guild. “The most thoughtful consumer companies say, Employee for now, customer for life,” she says. With the economy 30 million jobs short of what it had before the pandemic, though, workers and employers may not see much use in training for jobs that may not be available for months or even years. And not every worker is interested in studying data science, cloud computing or artificial intelligence. But those who have found a way to move from dying fields to in-demand jobs are likely to do better. A few years ago, Tristen Alexander was a call-center rep at a Georgia power company when he took a six-month online course to earn a Google IT Support Professional Certificate. A Google scholarship covered the cost for Alexander, who has no college degree and was supporting his wife and two kids on about $38,000 a year. Alexander credits his certificate with helping him win a promotion and says he now earns more than $70,000 annually. What’s more, the promotion has given him a sense of job security. “I just think there’s a great need for everyone to learn something technical,” he tells me. Of course, Alexander knows that technology may significantly change his job in the next decade, so he’s already planning his next step. By 2021, he wants to master the skill of testing computer systems to spot vulnerabilities to hackers and gain a certificate in that practice, known as penetration testing. It will all but guarantee him a job, he says, working alongside the technology that’s changing the world. –With reporting by Alejandro de la Garza and Julia Zorthian/New York Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/4742543/robots-jobs-machines-work/", "https://time.com/5832140/going-back-to-work-coronavirus-rights/", "https://time.com/5809596/coronavirus-recession-jobs/", "https://time.com/5501056/artificial-intelligence-protect-workers/", "https://time.com/5812538/coronavirus-economic-damage-workers/", "https://time.com/5800901/coronavirus-map/"], "sentiment_score": 0.12113019249701495, "subjectivity_score": 0.39700566697062023},

But some proponents say that, by then, an unlikely tool—artificial intelligence—may be ready to help mental health practitioners mitigate the impact of the deficit. Medicine is already a fruitful area for artificial intelligence; it has shown promise in diagnosing disease, interpreting images and zeroing in on treatment plans. Though psychiatry is in many ways a uniquely human field, requiring emotional intelligence and perception that computers can’t simulate, even here, experts say, AI could have an impact. The field, they argue, could benefit from artificial intelligence’s ability to analyze data and pick up on patterns and warning signs so subtle humans might never notice them. “Clinicians actually get very little time to interact with patients,” says Peter Foltz, a research professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who this month published a paper about AI’s promise in psychiatry. “Patients tend to be remote, it’s very hard to get appointments and oftentimes they may be seen by a clinician [only] once every three months or six months.” Improve your mood by signing up for TIME’s guide to managing stress and anxiety. AI could be an effective way for clinicians to both make the best of the time they do have with patients, and bridge any gaps in access, Foltz says. AI-aided data analysis could help clinicians make diagnoses more quickly and accurately, getting patients on the right course of treatment faster—but perhaps more excitingly, Foltz says, apps or other programs that incorporate AI could allow clinicians to monitor their patients remotely, alerting them to issues or changes that arise between appointments and helping them incorporate that knowledge into treatment plans. That information could be lifesaving, since research has shown that regularly checking in with patients who are suicidal or in mental distress can keep them safe. Some mental-health apps and programs already incorporate AI—like Woebot, an app-based mood tracker and chatbot that combines AI and principles from cognitive behavioral therapy—but it’ll probably be some five to 10 years before algorithms are routinely used in clinics, according to psychiatrists interviewed by TIME. Even then, Dr. John Torous, director of digital psychiatry at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s Committee on Mental Health Information Technology, cautions that “artificial intelligence is only as strong as the data it’s trained on,” and, he says, mental health diagnostics have not been quantified well enough to program an algorithm. It’s possible that will happen in the future, with more and larger psychological studies, but, Torous says “it’s going to be an uphill challenge.” Not everyone shares that position. Speech and language have emerged as two of the clearest applications for AI in psychiatry, says Dr. Henry Nasrallah, a psychiatrist at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center who has written about AI’s place in the field. Speech and mental health are closely linked, he explains. Talking in a monotone can be a sign of depression; fast speech can point to mania; and disjointed word choice can be connected to schizophrenia. When these traits are pronounced enough, a human clinician might pick up on them—but AI algorithms, Nasrallah says, could be trained to flag signals and patterns too subtle for humans to detect. Foltz and his team in Boulder are working in this space, as are big-name companies like IBM. Foltz and his colleagues designed a mobile app that takes patients through a series of repeatable verbal exercises, like telling a story and answering questions about their emotional state. An AI system then assesses those soundbites for signs of mental distress, both by analyzing how they compare to the individual’s previous responses, and by measuring the clips against responses from a larger patient population. The team tested the system on 225 people living in either Northern Norway or rural Louisiana—two places with inadequate access to mental health care—and found that the app was at least as accurate as clinicians at picking up on speech-based signs of mental distress. Written language is also a promising area for AI-assisted mental health care, Nasrallah says. Studies have shown that machine learning algorithms trained to assess word choice and order are better than clinicians at distinguishing between real and fake suicide notes, meaning they’re good at picking up on signs of distress. Using these systems to regularly monitor a patient’s writing, perhaps through an app or periodic remote check-in with mental health professionals, could feasibly offer a way to assess their risk of self-harm. Wearable devices offer further opportunities. Many people already use wearables to track their sleep and physical activity, both of which are closely related to mental well-being, Nasrallah says; using artificial intelligence to analyze those behaviors could lead to valuable insights for clinicians. Even if these applications do pan out, Torous cautions that “nothing has ever been a panacea.” On one hand, he says, it’s exciting that technology is being pitched as a solution to problems that have long plagued the mental health field; but, on the other hand, “in some ways there’s so much desperation to make improvements to mental health that perhaps the tools are getting overvalued.” Nasrallah and Foltz emphasize that AI isn’t meant to replace human psychiatrists or completely reinvent the wheel. (“Our brain is a better computer than any AI,” Nasrallah says.) Instead, they say, it can provide data and insights that will streamline treatment. Alastair Denniston, an ophthalmologist and honorary professor at the U.K.’s University of Birmingham who this year published a research review about AI’s ability to diagnose disease, argues that, if anything, technology can help doctors focus on the human elements of medicine, rather than getting bogged down in the minutiae of diagnosis and data collection. Artificial intelligence “may allow us to have more time in our day to spend actually communicating effectively and being more human,” Denniston says. “Rather than being diagnostic machines… [doctors can] provide some of that empathy that can get swallowed up by the business of what we do.” Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/5709346/artificial-intelligence-health/", "https://time.com/5505804/cervical-cancer-screening-rates/", "https://time.com/5492063/artificial-intelligence-fertility/", "https://time.com/wellness-mags/", "https://time.com/5709368/how-to-solve-suicide/", "https://time.com/5066561/health-data-tracking-obsession/", "https://time.com/5494363/sleep-artificial-intelligence/", "https://time.com/5511322/exercise-depression-mental-health/"], "sentiment_score": 0.03832184628237259, "subjectivity_score": 0.40860147162778754},
{"type": "article", "header": "Airlines’ Emissions Halved During the Pandemic. Can the Industry Preserve Some of Those Gains as Travel Rebounds?", "author": "Ciara Nugent", "update_date/publish_date": "May 17, 2021 12:45 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6048871/pandemic-airlines-carbon-emissions/", "text": "Travel restrictions imposed across the world during the COVID-19 pandemic forced airlines to plead for government bailouts and lay off staff, while some folded entirely. There was one silver lining, though: a huge temporary drop in the sector’s carbon emissions. Now, as lockdowns begin to ease, and travellers book their first post-pandemic trips, aviation faces a stark challenge: is it possible for airlines to revive their businesses while lowering their emissions long term? In 2019, carbon dioxide emissions from aviation made up 2.5% of global emissions of the greenhouse gas. The plunge in traffic last year meant that, after decades of almost uninterrupted rapid growth, the sector’s carbon emissions fell by a record 48%, according to Carbon Monitor, an international watchdog. But as people return to pre-pandemic activities, driving up demand for energy globally, those emissions will start to rebound. Airline executives in the U.S. and other parts of the world with high vaccination rates are expecting a sharp uptick in air travel this year, bolstered by the news that the European Union plans to allow vaccinated tourists to visit this summer. Aviation is considered one of the hardest sectors of the global economy to decarbonize, because the fuels and technology needed to fly without emitting greenhouse gases are much less well-developed than clean energy sources in sectors such as electricity or road transport. As other sectors reduce their emissions, aviation is expected to make up an increasingly large share of the world’s total. While the pandemic’s impact on aviation will likely help bring down the industry’s emissions, it’s far from enough to meet long-term climate goals. Before COVID-19 hit, the sector’s carbon emissions were expected to be three times greater in 2050 than in 2015. Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a non-profit research group, thinks the increase will now be closer to 2.3 times. “So it’s still growing, just at a slower rate.”  Public and government pressure on airlines to do more to reduce emissions is ramping up. As some airlines became reliant on public bailouts during the pandemic, governments in Europe hardened their approach to aviation emissions. Austria made its rescue funds for Lufthansa’s Austrian Airlines unit dependent on the carrier cutting back domestic routes and agreeing to new emissions and fuel efficiency targets. France outlawed some short-haul domestic flights where rail alternatives are available, while the U.K. became the first major economy to include aviation emissions in its national carbon budget, setting what campaigners call an important precedent. Meanwhile, responding to pressure from politicians and the public, airlines have set themselves increasingly ambitious climate targets, with dozens pledging to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in recent months, compared to previous industry-wide plans to halve emissions by 2050.  “Before the pandemic, the sector was quite arrogant in feeling that it didn’t need to make the same sort of cuts and transformations that other sectors were doing,” says Andrew Murphy, aviation director at European clean transit campaign group Transport & Environment. “Now the politics has changed.” Airlines’ climate plans still rely heavily on carbon off-setting, where they essentially pay other sectors to reduce their emissions or absorb carbon from the atmosphere. A May 3 Greenpeace-led investigation found offsetting schemes still used by major airlines are highly flawed and may not be having the desired impact.  The industry’s preferred path out of its emissions bind is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Currently fuelling a tiny fraction of flights, SAF could cut aviation emissions by up to 80% if used more widely, according to the Air Transport Action Group, a trade association. It has been the focus of a flurry of lobbying activity, investment and discussions among policymakers as governments roll out COVID-19 recovery packages and climate plans. In the U.S., Congress is considering plans put forward by the Biden administration to introduce a tax credit for SAF production. Sustainable aviation fuels are made from a range of sources, including used cooking oil, animal fats, plant oils and waste vegetation, as well as wood. They have to meet certain criteria to be considered sustainable, and environmentalists have warned that, without strong oversight, production of these fuels could encourage deforestation because producers may end up clearing land to grow materials to produce the feedstocks. Cleaner “e-fuels”—synthetic alternatives to crude oil produced using renewable energy, water and carbon dioxide—are also in development and one was used to power a test flight for the first time worldwide in the Netherlands in February.  Oil companies, including Shell and BP, have invested in SAF, partnering with renewable energy firms and biofuel companies to create small supply chains. Currently, SAF costs between three and four times more than traditional kerosene fuel, while e-fuels can be between six and seven times more expensive than kerosene.  Over the last five years, SAF made up just 0.01% of total fuel use by the aviation industry, according to the International Energy Agency. But several airlines have announced plans to increase their use of SAF in recent weeks. In April, United Airlines announced a deal with a dozen companies to finance its use of 3.4 million gallons of SAF made from trash in 2021, tripling the amount it has used in each of the last five years. British Airways-owner International Airlines Group has committed to using sustainable aviation fuel to power 10% of its flights by 2030, while European carrier Ryanair has pledged to use SAF for 12.5% of its fuel needs by 2030. Meanwhile, the E.U. is expected to announce a mandate for a small proportion of fuel used in flights departing from airports in the bloc to be sustainable by 2030.  Supply chains would need to develop rapidly to meet those targets. A World Economic Forum report published in November found that, although enough sustainable feedstocks exist to power the entire industry on SAF, the production plants currently planned worldwide would only have capacity to produce 4 million tons annually each year, around 1% of projected fuel demand. Airlines and oil companies argue that governments need to offer subsidies, tax breaks and other incentives to allow them to develop SAF quickly enough to meet emissions goals. Michael Gill, environment director of industry trade body the International Air Transport Association (IATA), says that investing in SAF is a “win-win-win” option for governments during the economic recovery from COVID-19. “You can create new jobs, you can have the construction of new facilities in geographical areas that need that kind of large scale infrastructure. And you can help aviation build a sustainable future,“ he says. IATA is also calling for research and development of more radical new zero-emissions aircraft technology, such as planes powered by hydrogen, which experts hope will eventually be used in most short-haul flights. Some climate activists may be uncomfortable with the aviation sector or oil companies, both massive polluters, receiving public funds and tax breaks to develop the technologies that they need to protect their bottom lines in a future of increased climate regulation. Murphy, of Transport & Environment, says it’s reasonable for any sector that needs to decarbonize to ask for government support, given the urgency of scaling up new technologies. “But it can’t just be about handing out money for research and development and doing test drives,” he says. “The money needs to be accompanied with binding targets [on SAF use and emissions.]” Before the pandemic, the aviation industry had argued that the sector was too international to be regulated by individual countries. The most important piece of emissions regulation for the sector was an international agreement to offset future increases on the sector’s 2020 emissions, criticized by climate campaigners as too weak to have an impact.  Bailouts have changed the dynamic for regulation, Murphy says. “We’re seeing airlines now recognize that if it was not for the efforts of national governments and the generosity of taxpayers, the sector would have gone bankrupt. That has caused a re-evaluation of what they can expect to get away with.” Consultancy McKinsey says the “staggering” debt levels built up by airlines over the last year mean states that bail out airlines will have an increasingly active role in the sector, creating opportunities for governments to work with airlines, including on commitments to cut emissions. E.U. leaders are considering scrapping a tax exemption on jet fuel for international flights, which exists partly because of the difficulty of coordinating taxes between national governments, but has attracted increasing criticism as the bloc emerges as a climate leader.  On the flip side, it’s also possible that increased state ownership of airlines will make governments impatient to return them to profitability, and therefore less willing to impose new taxes or restrictions that could hit airlines’ bottom line. After France’s citizens assembly on climate proposed a new environmental tax on flights in September, some lawmakers argued it didn’t make sense to raise taxes on airlines that the state was propping up and the plans were shelved. The U.K. government is weighing plans to eliminate a roughly $18 duty it imposes on domestic flights to offer some relief for airlines. IATA opposes any tax increases on aviation during the COVID-19 recovery.  Flying is likely to remain one of the most carbon-intensive activities humans can participate in for years to come, and avoiding flights is one of the most effective ways for people in rich countries to reduce their emissions. A return flight from San Francisco to London emits the equivalent of around 5.5 metric tons of CO2 per person—more than the world’s annual average per person emissions in 2019 (4.8 metric tons). It is also a luxury enjoyed by a privileged few. Just 11% of the global population took a flight in 2018 and 1% of the population was responsible for 50% of aviation emissions, according to a study led by Sweden’s Linnaeus University in November. Climate activists, including many scientists, say a rapid and massive reduction in air travel is the only safe path to avoid catastrophic climate change. Individual responsibility will likely play a role in the drive to cut emissions. Since before the pandemic, the “flight shame” movement, popularized by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, had already begun to have a “real impact” on demand for short-haul air travel in Europe, Rutherford says. “That big change in attitudes that started in 2019, has not gone away and we’re going to see those political pressures build as the industry recovers from COVID.” Some governments and trade groups are trying to encourage a shift toward rail travel for shorter journeys. While the French and Austrian governments have made efforts to curtail short-haul air travel, the German Aviation Association is collaborating with rail company Deutsche Bahn to replace domestic flight routes with train services in Germany. Governments in countries including Italy and Belgium are investing heavily in their train networks as part of recovery plans to help pull them out of the economic crisis brought about by the pandemic.  For the U.S., a pivot from shorter flights to train travel will be more challenging. The country covers an area twice the size of the E.U., and many stretches of its rail network suffer from decades of under investment. In a recent interview with TIME, William Flynn, the CEO of passenger rail service Amtrak, said he would use $80 billion in federal funds proposed in President Biden’s infrastructure plan to overhaul and improve key routes. But far more is likely needed to improve service enough to make trains an attractive replacement for flights, Rutherford says. Some U.S. airlines are beginning to voluntarily coordinate better with rail networks to phase out some unnecessary short-haul routes, but it’s still on a “case by case basis,” he adds. Although curbs on short-haul flights will have some impact, according to ICCT data, more than two thirds of aviation’s emissions come from medium- or long-haul flights, where train and road travel are not realistic alternatives. Forcing airlines to limit the services they provide on these routes is less palatable for governments than short-haul restrictions.  But behavioural changes triggered by the pandemic may have a dramatic impact on the long-haul business. Companies are reassessing the value of business travel after a year of conducting meetings using video conferencing services like Zoom. Only a third of business travelers in the U.K. expect to return to their pre-pandemic habits, according to an April poll. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicts that more than 50% of business travel will disappear. McKinsey is more conservative, estimating in April that business travel will recover to around 80% of pre-pandemic levels by 2024.  Business travelers, who tend to book late and often choose premium seats, generate the bulk of the profits on long-haul flights. This type of travel accounts for up to 75% of airlines’ revenues on some routes. To make up for the loss, McKinsey says, airlines may reduce the frequency of flights, raise prices for leisure travelers and close the gap in prices for direct and connecting flights. All of those measures would likely have the unintentional benefit of helping to reduce emissions. Gill, IATA’s environment director, acknowledges that many people who are considering booking a flight when travel restrictions lift “will be asking themselves that question: from an environmental perspective, is this responsible? We need to answer that question as an industry.” Write to Ciara Nugent at ciara.nugent@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/5956410/carbon-emissions-increase-2021/", "https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2019-greta-thunberg/", "https://time.com/6026599/amtrak-interview/"], "sentiment_score": 0.0733576184833168, "subjectivity_score": 0.44083861359001014},

At least four members of Congress from both sides of the aisle are demanding that Zuckerberg appear in person to explain the breach, with some asking that other technology executives join him. “Disarray at Facebook – amid apparent downsizing of security team – makes the need for full transparency in public testimony before Congress more urgent than ever,” said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat. “Following Cambridge Analytica revelations, Zuckerberg and other Facebook execs – as well as Stamos himself – must publicly clarify who is in charge of protecting users and preventing security threats.”  Blumenthal was referring to Alex Stamos, the Chief Information Security officer at Facebook, who the New York Times reported Monday night was leaving the company amid clashes with executives about handling reports about the misuse of its platform.  The Times and the Guardian reported over the weekend that Cambridge Analytica had obtained information from 50 millions of Facebook users without consent, and falsely claimed that the information had been deleted. The reports claimed that the firm used it to target voters for political advertising, and to sway voters towards Trump. Cambridge Analytica says none of the data was used in the Trump campaign. In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said it deleted the user data when it learned that it violated Facebook’s terms of service. IT also said the data was never used as part of Trump’s presidential campaign. Facebook responded to the reports by suspending Cambridge Analytica and issued a lengthy statement denying there was a breach. However, Zuckerberg and other top executives have not commented individually on the growing scandal. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican, sent a bi-partisan letter to Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, requesting that Zuckerberg appear before the committee for a hearing, along with the Chief Executives from other major technology companies like Twitter and Google. Representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter testified before Congress last fall about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but none of the chief executives appeared. “A hearing featuring testimony with CEOs would provide the Committee the opportunity to hear an update on the progress of these companies’ voluntary measures to combat attempted foreign interference and what is being done to protect Americans’ data and limit abuse of the platforms, as well as to assess what measures should be taken before the next elections,” Klobuchar and Kennedy said in their letter on Monday. A spokesman for Grassley said that the Senator is “gathering information” but has yet to make a decision about holding a hearing. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, echoed the request from Klobuchar and Kennedy on Tuesday morning. “It’s time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other CEOs to testify before Congress. The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election,” he wrote on Twitter. It's time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other CEOs to testify before Congress.

Facebook, which is the largest social media company in the world, admitted today that the number was much higher than previously believed at the bottom of a blog post written by Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer. “In total, we believe the Facebook information of up to 87 million people — mostly in the US — may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica,” he wrote. He laid out nine ways Facebook is now working on to better protect user information, saying that the changes will limit the ways apps are allowed to collect and share people’s information. Third party apps will now be restricted from accessing certain kinds of user information they could previously collect from Facebook features like Events, Groups and Pages. Other changes include updates to the ways third-party apps can collect data related to logins for things like “check-ins, likes, photos, posts, videos, events and groups,” the company’s statement reads. It also says that apps will no longer be allowed to collect personal data such as “religious or political views, relationship status and details, custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness activity, book reading activity, music listening activity, news reading, video watch activity, and games activity.” The social media juggernaut also announced that it has disabled certain features in “search and account recovery” to prevent people’s public profiles from being scraped by “malicious actors.” It is also completely shutting down its Partner Categories, which is “a product that lets third-party data providers offer their targeting directly on Facebook,” the statement says. A new feature is also being added to everyone’s newsfeed — a link at the top of the page that will allow users to see what information apps they use have collected about them, and also allow users to remove those apps if they choose. Facebook pledged to alert those users whose personal data was improperly collected by Cambridge Analytica. Facebook also posted a link to updated policies for Instagram, which it owns. While the users affected are mainly in the U.S., the BBC has also reported that about one million of the 87 million users impacted are based in the U.K. Facebook’s announcement that almost 90 million users were affected comes on the heels of the news that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress on April 11. The drama began when the $500 billion company admitted earlier in March that data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica, which has close ties to President Trump’s election campaign and right-leaning megadonors, used data that had been collected from millions of users without their consent. Facebook has since suspended Cambridge Analytica’s access to its platform. Facebook continues to take a beating from commentators and investors alike as its stock keeps plunging — the company’s market cap dropped $50 billion alone during first week that the scandal came to light, becoming its largest ever two-day drop. Meanwhile, lawmakers in the U.S. and the U.K. who demanded Zuckerberg explain his company’s practices may finally get some answers during his testimony next week. Here’s what to know about Facebook’s latest crisis. Cambridge Analytica is a political analysis firm that claims to build psychological profiles of voters to help its clients win elections. The company is accused of buying millions of Americans’ data from a researcher who told Facebook he was collecting it strictly for academic purposes. Facebook allowed Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge who owns a company called Global Science Research, to harvest data from users who downloaded his app. The problem was that Facebook users who agreed to give their information to Kogan’s app also gave up permission to harvest data on all their Facebook friends, as well, according to the Guardian. The breach occurred when Kogan then sold this data to Cambridge Analytica, which is against Facebook’s rules. Facebook says it has since changed the way it allows researchers to collect data from the platform as a result. Christopher Wylie, a whistleblower who worked at Cambridge Analytica before quitting in 2014, claimed on NBC’s Today Show Monday morning that the firm was “founded on misappropriated data of at least 50 million Facebook users.” Wylie added that Cambridge Analytica’s goal was to establish profiling algorithms that would “allow us to explore mental vulnerabilities of people, and then map out ways to inject information into different streams or channels of content online so that people started to see things all over the place that may or may not have been true.” The data firm initially told British Parliament it did not collect people’s information without their content during a hearing in February, but later admitted in a statement to the New York Times that they did in fact obtain the data, though the company claims to have deleted the information as soon as it found out it violated Facebook’s privacy rules. Cambridge Analytica issued a number of press releases in the days following the explosive media reports, saying that it “strongly denies the claims” it acted improperly. “In 2014 we received Facebook data and derivatives of Facebook data from another company, GSR, that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research,” the statement reads. “After it subsequently became known that GSR had broken its contract with Cambridge Analytica because it had not adhered to data protection regulation, Cambridge Analytica deleted all the Facebook data and derivatives, in cooperation with Facebook… This Facebook data was not used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump presidential campaign.” Facebook also issued a statement on its website Monday saying that the claim there was a data breach is “completely false” and Facebook users “gave their consent” when they signed up for certain kinds of apps, like the one Kogan exploited for data collection purposes. The social media juggernaut also maintained that “no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” Christopher Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica, spoke out about the firm’s practices on the Today Show Monday morning after previously giving an interview to the New York Times. Wylie, who quit the company in 2014, said he believes it’s important for Americans to know what companies are doing with their personal information, as well as whether Cambridge Analytica’s practices influenced the democratic process. “This was a company [Cambridge Analytica] that really took fake news to the next level by powering it with algorithms,” he said in an interview on the Today Show Monday morning. Watch @savannahguthrie's full interview with Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie pic.twitter.com/NMbHoOkDWA Wylie also claimed that Cambridge Analytica has been in talks with Russian oil companies and employs a psychologist who works on Russia-funded projects. Any ties between Cambridge and Russia could complicate matters for Facebook, which has spent the past several months grappling with accusations that Moscow used it and other social media networks to meddle in the 2016 U.S. elections. In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said Wylie left the company to found a rival firm. “Their source is a former contractor for Cambridge Analytica – not a founder as has been claimed – who left in 2014 and is misrepresenting himself and the company throughout his comments,” the company said. Onetime Trump campaign advisor and Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was previously vice president of Cambridge Analytica’s board, according to the New York Times. Wylie told the Guardian that Bannon was his boss at Cambridge Analytica. Bannon has been involved in propping up right-wing political groups for years, having been the executive chairman and co-founder of Breitbart News, a far right-wing digital publication, until he stepped down from the position in January. Additionally, Republican megadonor and onetime Breitbart News CEO Robert Mercer, who has funded numerous conservative campaigns at every level of government, invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica. His daughter, Rebekah Mercer was also a board member of the political data firm. The Mercers originally supported Ted Cruz’ presidential campaign, but became patrons of the Trump campaign after Cruz bowed out of the 2016 presidential race. The Times reported that through their family foundation the Mercer’s have donated more than $100 million to conservative causes — $10 million of which went to Breitbart News, and another $6 million that went to the Government Accountability Institute, a nonprofit founded by Bannon. Facebook executives responded to the crisis on Wednesday by issuing statements on the social media platform. Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook made mistakes and acknowledged that his company failed to responsibly protect the data of customers. He gave a timeline explaining how the improper data harvesting occurred, and said that in 2014 the company changed its practices to limit the ability of “abusive apps” to collect data from users and their other Facebook friends who did not give consent. “In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social…To do this, we enabled people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them….In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends’ data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends’ data.” Zuckerberg also acknowledged that journalists informed Facebook as early as 2015 that Kogan shared this data with Cambridge Analytica, and said the company subsequently banned Kogan’s apps from the social network because they violated Facebook policies. “This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that,” he wrote on Facebook. He also said the company will investigate all apps that had “access to large amount of information” before the 2014 policy changes, and that Facebook plans to further restrict developers’ access to Facebook users’ data moving forward. The company will also make it easier for users to deny permission to third party developers that collect their personal information. As part of this effort, the company plans to move its privacy tool to the top of the News Feed. Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg shared Zuckerberg’s post on her own Facebook page, saying she “deeply regrets” that the company did not do more to address the problem. Facebook will also start to ban developers who misuse “personally identifiable information” and alert users when Facebook learns their data has been misused, she wrote.

{"type": "article", "header": "You Deserve Privacy Online. Here’s How You Could Actually Get It", "author": null, "update_date/publish_date": "Jan. 16, 2019", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/collection-post/5502591/tim-cook-data-privacy/", "text": "The requested content could not be loaded.Try now In 2019, it’s time to stand up for the right to privacy—yours, mine, all of ours. Consumers shouldn’t have to tolerate another year of companies irresponsibly amassing huge user profiles, data breaches that seem out of control and the vanishing ability to control our own digital lives. This problem is solvable—it isn’t too big, too challenging or too late. Innovation, breakthrough ideas and great features can go hand in hand with user privacy—and they must. Realizing technology’s potential depends on it. That’s why I and others are calling on the U.S. Congress to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation—a landmark package of reforms that protect and empower the consumer. Last year, before a global body of privacy regulators, I laid out four principles that I believe should guide legislation:\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”] First, the right to have personal data minimized. Companies should challenge themselves to strip identifying information from customer data or avoid collecting it in the first place. Second, the right to knowledge—to know what data is being collected and why. Third, the right to access. Companies should make it easy for you to access, correct and delete your personal data. And fourth, the right to data security, without which trust is impossible. But laws alone aren’t enough to ensure that individuals can make use of their privacy rights. We also need to give people tools that they can use to take action. To that end, here’s an idea that could make a real difference. One of the biggest challenges in protecting privacy is that many of the violations are invisible. For example, you might have bought a product from an online retailer—something most of us have done. But what the retailer doesn’t tell you is that it then turned around and sold or transferred information about your purchase to a “data broker”—a company that exists purely to collect your information, package it and sell it to yet another buyer. The trail disappears before you even know there is a trail. Right now, all of these secondary markets for your information exist in a shadow economy that’s largely unchecked—out of sight of consumers, regulators and lawmakers. Let’s be clear: you never signed up for that. We think every user should have the chance to say, “Wait a minute. That’s my information that you’re selling, and I didn’t consent.” Meaningful, comprehensive federal privacy legislation should not only aim to put consumers in control of their data, it should also shine a light on actors trafficking in your data behind the scenes. Some state laws are looking to accomplish just that, but right now there is no federal standard protecting Americans from these practices. That’s why we believe the Federal Trade Commission should establish a data-broker clearinghouse, requiring all data brokers to register, enabling consumers to track the transactions that have bundled and sold their data from place to place, and giving users the power to delete their data on demand, freely, easily and online, once and for all. As this debate kicks off, there will be plenty of proposals and competing interests for policymakers to consider. We cannot lose sight of the most important constituency: individuals trying to win back their right to privacy. Technology has the potential to keep changing the world for the better, but it will never achieve that potential without the full faith and confidence of the people who use it.

Ranging from rule exemptions for high-profile users to Instagram’s toll on teens’ mental health, the Journal‘s “Facebook Files” expose internal Facebook research that appears to show just how knowledgable the company was of the platform’s “ill-effects.” The Journal’s reports, three so far, are based on a review of internal Facebook documents, including research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management. They reveal that the company has allegedly failed to fix numerous problems that it’s long known about, and in some cases made them worse. “Time and again, the documents show, Facebook’s researchers have identified the platform’s ill effects. Time and again, despite congressional hearings, its own pledges and numerous media exposés, the company didn’t fix them,” the Journal reports. “The documents offer perhaps the clearest picture thus far of how broadly Facebook’s problems are known inside the company, up to the chief executive himself.” Read More: Facebook Banned a Hindu Extremist Group—Then Left Most of Its Pages Online for Months Here’s what to know about the Journal‘s ongoing revelations about Facebook. Due to an internal program known as “cross check” or “XCheck,” high-profile Facebook users are exempt from some or all of the platform’s rules, according to the debut installment of the “Facebook Files.” Published Monday, the Journal‘s inaugural report examines how the program, originally intended to quality-control actions taken against “elite” users like celebrities, politicians and journalists, has actually allowed these users to avoid moderation. Reportedly, those protected are either “whitelisted,” meaning they aren’t subject to enforcement actions from Facebook, or allowed to post rule-violating content pending subsequent review by Facebook employees. However, according to a 2019 internal document reviewed by the Journal, less than 10% of the posts flagged to XCheck were actually reviewed. The program reportedly protected at least 5.8 million people as of 2020, including former President Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Candace Owens, and has allowed misinformation, harassment, calls to violence and revenge porn to remain on the platform. “We are not actually doing what we say we do publicly,” a 2019 internal review reportedly read. “Unlike the rest of our community, these people can violate our standards without any consequences.” Read More: Facebook Says It Supports Internet Regulation. Here’s an Ambitious Proposal That Might Actually Make a Difference Facebook spokesman Andy Stone told the Journal that criticism of XCheck is warranted and that Facebook has been working to address the problems with the program, which is meant to “accurately enforce policies on content that could require more understanding.” Facebook, which owns Instagram, has known for years that the photo sharing platform is harmful to the mental health of a significant percentage of young users, and particularly teen girls, according to a Journal report published Tuesday. Citing internal studies that Facebook conducted over the past three years, the report details how the company downplayed its own research on negative effects that Instagram has on the millions of young people who make up nearly half of its user base, ranging from eating disorders to depression to suicidal thoughts. One internal Facebook presentation reviewed by the Journal showed that among teens who reported suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users and 6% of American users traced the issue to the photo-sharing app. The report states that Facebook’s own research found that teenage girls are particularly susceptible to the mental toll of Instagram, where highly filtered and edited photos promoting unrealistic and often unattainable body standards run rampant. In a 2019 presentation, researchers said that Instagram makes body image issues worse for one in three teen girls. A presentation from the following March, reviewed by the Journal, reported that 32% of teen girls who felt bad about their bodies felt worse when they looked at Instagram. “Comparisons on Instagram can change how young women view and describe themselves,” one slide read. But that doesn’t mean that teen boys don’t also suffer mental health consequences from Instagram use. Facebook’s research reportedly showed that 40% of teen boys experience the effects of negative social comparison while using Instagram, while 14% of boys in the U.S. said Instagram made them feel worse about themselves. Despite these findings, Facebook never made its research public or available to academics or lawmakers who asked for it, the Journal reported. Researchers also found that some of the features that play a key role in Instagram’s success and addictive nature, like the Explore page, which serves users curated posts based on their interests, are among the most harmful to young people. “Aspects of Instagram exacerbate each other to create a perfect storm,” the research reportedly said. In response to a request for comment on the Journal‘s report, an Instagram spokesperson pointed TIME to a Tuesday blog post stating that while the story “focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light,” the company stands by the research as it “demonstrates our commitment to understanding complex and difficult issues young people may struggle with, and informs all the work we do to help those experiencing these issues.” Read More: Facebook’s New Zoom Competitor Adds Virtual Reality to Conference Calls. Here’s What It’s Like The Journal goes on to say that Instagram’s research mirrors external research that “the effects of social media on people’s well-being is mixed” and that “[s]ocial media isn’t inherently good or bad for people. Many find it helpful one day, and problematic the next. What seems to matter most is how people use social media, and their state of mind when they use it.” The Journal‘s report comes in the wake of Facebook reaffirming its intention to continue with the development of an Instagram for kids under 13 despite pressure from lawmakers to abandon the plan. When asked about the connection between children’s declining mental health and social media platforms at a May congressional hearing, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the research isn’t “conclusive.” When Facebook overhauled its News Feed algorithm to promote “meaningful social interactions” in 2018, it instead resulted in a system that amplifies divisive content on the platform, the Journal reported Wednesday. While Zuckerberg said the goal of the change was to “strengthen bonds between users and to improve their well-being,” Facebook staffers reportedly warned that the algorithm’s heavy weighting of reshared material was pushing polarizing and false content that drew outrage, and therefore more comments and reactions, to the forefront of users’ News Feeds. “Misinformation, toxicity, and violent content are inordinately prevalent among reshares,” researchers said in an internal memo reviewed by the Journal. Zuckerberg also reportedly resisted some proposed fixes to the issue, like eliminating a boost the algorithm gave to content most likely to be reshared by long chains of users, out of concern that it would lead to decreased user engagement. In response, Lars Backstrom, a Facebook vice president of engineering, told the Journal that any algorithm can promote harmful content and that the company has an “integrity team” working to mitigate these issues. “Like any optimization, there’s going to be some ways that it gets exploited or taken advantage of,” he said.

{"type": "article", "header": "How Social Media Is a Toxic Mirror", "author": "Rachel Simmons", "update_date/publish_date": "August 19, 2016 2:11 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4459153/social-media-body-image/", "text": "We’ve long understood that movies, magazines and television damage teens’ body image by enforcing a “thin ideal.” Less known is the impact of social media on body confidence. With the rapid aging down of smart phone ownership, most parents spend “digital parenting” time on character coaching, making sure their kids think before they post and refrain from cyberbullying. For at least a decade, educators like me have argued that social media’s biggest threat was its likeness to a bathroom wall, letting teens sling insults with the recklessness that comes only with anonymity. Not anymore. Social media has also become a toxic mirror. Earlier this year, psychologists found robust cross-cultural evidence linking social media use to body image concerns, dieting, body surveillance, a drive for thinness and self-objectification in adolescents. Note: that doesn’t mean social media cause the problems, but that there’s a strong association between them. Visual platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat deliver the tools that allow teens to earn approval for their appearance and compare themselves to others. The most vulnerable users, researchers say, are the ones who spend most of their time posting, commenting on and comparing themselves to photos. One study found that female college students who did this on Facebook were more likely to link their self-worth to their looks. Interestingly, while girls report more body image disturbance and disordered eating than boys—studies have shown both can be equally damaged by social media.  And thanks to an array of free applications, selfie-holics now have the power to alter their bodies in pictures in a way that’s practically on par with makeup and other beauty products. If the Internet has been called a great democratizer, perhaps what social media has done is let anyone enter the beauty pageant. Teens can cover up pimples, whiten teeth and even airbrush with the swipe of a finger, curating their own image to become prettier, thinner and hotter. All this provides an illusion of control: if I spend more time and really work at it, I can improve at being beautiful. “I don’t get to choose how I’m going to leave my apartment today,” one young woman told me. “If I could, my body would look different. But I can choose which picture makes my arms look thinner.” But invariably, the line between a “like” and feeling ranked becomes blurred. “I think it affects teens subconsciously just seeing how many likes they get and how much attention get just for how they look,” one 16-year-old told me. What teens share online is dwarfed by what they consume. Pre-Internet, you had to hoof it to the grocery store to find a magazine with celebrity bodies—or at least filch your mother’s copy from the bathroom. Now the pictures are as endless as they are available. Teens can spend hours fixating on the toned arms or glutes of celebrities, who hawk their bodies as much as their talent. The meteoric rise of the “wellness” industry online has launched an entire industry of fitness celebrities on social media. Millions of followers embrace their regimens for diet and exercise, but increasingly, the drive for “wellness” and “clean eating” has become stealthy cover for more dieting and deprivation. This year, an analysis of 50 so-called “fitspiration” websites revealed messaging that was indistinguishable, at times, from pro-anorexia (pro-ana) or “thinspiration” websites. Both contained strong language inducing guilt about weight or the body, and promoted dieting, restraint and fat and weight stigmatization. Writing in Vice, 24-year-old Ruby Tandoh recounted how a focus on “healthy” and “clean” eating and “lifestyle” enabled her to hide her increasingly disordered eating and deflect concerned peers. “I had found wellness,” she wrote. “I was not well.” Many teens are media-literate about movies and magazines; they take in digitally altered images with a critical eye. Less clear is how social media literate they are. The older adolescents I work with often shrug off conversations about the perils of social media with a “duh” or “I know that already.” That doesn’t mean they’re not listening, or feeling worried that their bodies don’t measure up. (Besides, this population is hardly famous for gushing gratitude for parental advice.) So what can parents do? Ask teens their opinion of the ways people modify their own appearance online: Why do people do it? What do they gain, and from whom? Sometimes just naming a feeling as normal can make a young adult feel less alone. It never hurts to tell your teen they matter more than their looks. As they peer into the mirror on the screen, a good old-fashioned “I love you exactly as you are” may be more timely than ever.

Without the Valencia filter. Without square-format pictures. Without amateur food photography filling your feed. But that world did once exist — just a mere six years ago. On this day in 2010, Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger unleashed the photo-sharing platform that, though they didn’t know it at the time, would soon become a selfie-filled, multi-billion-dollar beast used by 500 million people. Although Instagram wasn’t yet available to the public, Systrom and Krieger started testing their brainchild with a few experimental snaps. Here’s how it all went down, based on the Instagram histories of the two men. 1:26 p.m.: Mike Krieger (@mikeyk) posts the first-ever Instagram. It’s a somewhat artsy shot out of a window towards a marina, with tilted framing and what appears to be heavy filtering. As Instagram did not yet have location tagging at this point, it’s unclear where, exactly, Krieger posted from. He did not append a caption. A post shared by Mike Krieger (@mikeyk) 3:00 p.m.: Krieger then uploads the second-ever Instagram. This time, it’s a picture of co-founder Systrom at his desk. Again: heavy filtering, slightly blurred optics. Systrom, who goes by the handle “@kevin,” was the first to comment: “Friday work,” he wrote. After that, Krieger added: “Kevin hard at work.” Little did they know that someday soon, a simple caption or comment explaining a scene just wouldn’t fly. A post shared by Mike Krieger (@mikeyk) 3:58 p.m.: Systrom kicks off his own account with a picture of something he captions as “Awesome pins.” To this day, it remains unclear what, exactly, the light-up emoji-like symbols are a part of, where the image was taken, or what Systrom was attempting to showcase with this choice of first post. A post shared by Kevin Systrom (@kevin) 4:11 p.m.: Krieger, ever the trailblazer, launches the lauded tradition of Instagram food photography with a sepia-toned snap of a dinner table. Based on the chopsticks, it looks like some kind of Asian food was consumed. There’s also plenty of beer to be had. A post shared by Mike Krieger (@mikeyk) 4:42 p.m.: Systrom counters with his own food snap. Primary components: a fork and some kind of tomato-based or red sauce dish in a white bowl. The color composition is strong, but the lack of clarity wouldn’t cut it in today’s competitive food ‘gram market. A post shared by Kevin Systrom (@kevin) 5:05 p.m.: Looks like Krieger hit up the movie theater to celebrate a big first day of ‘gramming, based on this super-blurry snap captioned only “Inception.” The Christopher Nolan movie of the same name, starring Leonardo diCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, had come out just a few days prior — so it’s a fair guess that Krieger watched it that night. A post shared by Mike Krieger (@mikeyk) 5:24 p.m.: Meanwhile, Systrom’s prophetic third post would set the stage for one of the most popular Instagram categories: puppy pics. A post shared by Kevin Systrom (@kevin) 5:29 p.m.: The inaugural puppy pic was quickly followed five minutes later by a snap of the taco stand Systrom was, evidently, visiting. Looks like a Valencia filter to us. A post shared by Kevin Systrom (@kevin) 5:33 p.m.: Systrom was really on a roll; he finished up the day with a picture of a companion sipping what looks like a very delicious cocktail. A post shared by Kevin Systrom (@kevin) And so concluded the first day in Instagram posting history. It was an illustrious start, touching on most of the components we would soon see as trends: food pics, animal photos, artsy images, and of course plenty of documentation of carousing.

{"type": "article", "header": "How Donald Trump Courted Gay Voters at the Convention", "author": "Philip Elliott / Cleveland", "update_date/publish_date": "July 21, 2016 11:01 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4418475/republican-convention-peter-thiel-lgbt-gay-rights/", "text": "Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel knew he just had to get to the end of the line. Don’t slow down, don’t give the audience a chance to react until he had delivered the whole point. “I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all I am proud to be an American,” Thiel said Thursday, drawing Republicans to their feet in cheers of “USA, USA” on the final night of their nominating convention. The words made history — the first time a Republican convention speaker noted his sexual orientation — but also left the party stuck in something of a contradiction. Donald Trump’s acceptance speech mentioned gay rights and it drew cheers too. “I have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you,” Trump said, straying slightly from an otherwise closely scripted speech. It was an uneasy moment inside the hall, with those who disagreed choosing to stay silent. After all, days earlier, the party adopted as part of its platform ideas that gays and lesbians can be made into heterosexuals through “conversion therapies” and that marriage should be limited to straight couples — setting aside the Supreme Court ruling that rendered opposition moot with a ruling that all couples can marry. If the GOP platform were enacted, some of Thiel’s rights would be rolled back. To say there has been a tension over LGBT rights in Cleveland would be an understatement. Thursday night’s end of Republicans’ nominating convention brought to an end one of the most disjointed, least consistent weeks in American politics. Thiel didn’t even make it through the first paragraph of his speech when a heckler shouted an antigay epithet from the balcony. By the time Thiel uttered his six, history-making words — “I am proud to be gay” — the audience inside the arena had come to see Thiel as a person, not someone who deserved jeered. Thiel’s inclusion on the schedule was always high-risk. Yes, he founded PayPal and was an early Facebook investor. But he’s also an openly gay man in a party that has seldom embraced such members. Like the broader culture, there is a generational divide on LGBT rights inside the GOP, and this was not an audience that tilted toward youth. Thiel and his team knew the appearance was fraught with potential problems, but decided it was worth the risk. He just had to keep the speech moving. “When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union, and we won. Now, we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?” Thiel said, nodding to his libertarian instincts and showing his disgust with those who have kept their eyes on public bathrooms. Fights about such private spaces should not have been in the platform, to Thiel’s frustration. “I don’t pretend to agree with every plank in our party’s platform, but fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline,” Thiel said. “And nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump.” It was a rejection of the GOP orthodoxy with Trump’s tacit endorsement. There are signs that party is shifting. At a packed, off-site event this week, reality-TV personality and Olympian Caitlyn Jenner said it was easier to come out as transgender than to come out as a Republican. “I get it. The Democratic Party does a better job when it comes to the LGBT and trans community,” Jenner said. “The Republican Party needs to understand. They need to know people who are trans.” The culture wars, however, had a fertile battleground in Cleveland. Retired Lieut.-Gen. Michael Flynn mocked the Obama Administration for being too inclusive with the military: “War is not about bathrooms.” It won hearty support from delegates on the floor, who see LGBT rights as yet another example of political correctness gone wild. Trump brought the crowd to a roar, saying: “We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.” So delegates are to be forgiven for not fully understanding what, exactly, the GOP is trying to do at other points. From the podium, a Trump executive said her boss “knows LGBTQ lives matter” — using one of the more inclusive versions of an acronym that is not on the tips of these conservatives’ tongues. “We are the party of the open door,” Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich framed LGBT rights through national security. “If our enemies had their way, gays, lesbians and transgender citizens would be put to death as they are today in the Islamic State and Iran,” he said. And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said the Constitution does not see sexual identity. “Whether you are gay or straight, the Bill of Rights protects the rights of all of us to live according to our conscience,” he said. Thiel was the first openly gay individual to address a GOP convention since 2000, when former Representative Jim Kolbe spoke — and some delegates lowered their head in silent, prayerful protest back then, even though Kolbe said nothing about his sexuality. But that’s not to say gays and lesbians have not been at conventions since. Mary Cheney, the daughter of Vice President Dick Cheney and one of his top aides, watched her father’s 2004 speech from the VIP box with her partner Heather. And there is a corps of LGBT Republican operatives who power the party behind the scenes and fund it with their checkbooks. Thiel’s moment Thursday night was, in part, an acknowledgement that the party has made its road to the White House more difficult than it needed to be. Four years ago, with a less-conservative platform on marriage, Republicans won just 22% of voters who identified themselves to exit pollsters as gay, lesbian or bisexual. President Obama’s re-election bid carried 76% of them. Thiel’s speech Thursday night was unlikely to push it to an equal balance, but it might have changed a few minds inside the hall — the very people who insisted on the socially conservative platform positions that Democrats so easily demonize.

{"type": "article", "header": "Amtrak’s Boss Has a Plan to Make You Love Trains Again. Will it Work?", "author": "Patrick Lucas Austin", "update_date/publish_date": "May 7, 2021 2:21 PM EDT | May 3, 2021 7:19 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/6026599/amtrak-interview/", "text": "Across much of the U.S., taking the train isn’t exactly convenient. Slow service, delays, and poor access often make alternatives like flying or driving more attractive. But on March 31, President Joe Biden—nicknamed “Amtrak Joe” for his frequent trips between Delaware and Washington, D.C.—unveiled his American Jobs Plan, which among other things proposes $80 billion in new funding for Amtrak, the country’s major passenger rail service. Could that be enough money to get the country the high-speed rail network it deserves? Likely not. But Amtrak CEO William Flynn, who took charge of the semi-public, for-profit rail operator last spring, has big plans regardless. Before the pandemic, Amtrak—which turned 50 years old on May 1—looked to be on the right track: it posted revenue of about $3.5 billion in fiscal 2019, up nearly 3.5% year-over-year, thanks largely to record ridership. But revenue crashed by about 31% in 2020 amid the COVID-19 outbreak, falling to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020. After weathering the pandemic, Flynn’s next job is to get Amtrak rolling again—as well as dealing with skeptical lawmakers who say the partially-subsidized service is a waste of taxpayer dollars. In a recent interview with TIME, Flynn said his first priority is expanding passenger service to new cities, while also assessing and repairing existing infrastructure—primarily along the vital Northeast Corridor, which runs between Washington, D.C., through New York City and up to Boston and carried 12.5 million passengers in 2019. Flynn says about half of the $80 billion would go toward long-overdue repairs of century-old infrastructure along that route, like the East River Tunnel, Hudson River Tunnel, and the Susquehanna River Bridge. The rest would be used to expand intercity passenger rail service and repair infrastructure outside of the Northeast Corridor. “It really underscores the level of investment that’s required from two perspectives,” says Flynn. “To bring our Northeast Corridor and Washington-to-Boston overall underlying infrastructure to a state of good repair, because there have been decades of underinvestment in that corridor. But in addition, the President talked about expanding intercity passenger rail across our country, and that’s something that we have a very clear plan and strategy for as well.” What about high-speed rail? The U.S. leads the world with over 125,000 miles of rail lines criss-crossing the country, but it’s sorely lagging in speed. Only along two stretches of Amtrak’s system, both part of the Northeast Corridor and totaling just 173 miles, can its trains meet the minimum high-speed rail standard as measured by the International Union of Railways (UIC), which holds that “high-speed” trains should reach speeds of 124-155 miles per hour. Myriad ultrafast projects have been proposed over the years. Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft has poured over half a million dollars into feasibility studies around the high-speed Cascadia Rail project, an effort to link cities in the Pacific Northwest. Texas Central Railway, a private railway company, is in talks to build a high-speed line connecting Dallas and Houston. Finally, after multiple delays and budget overruns, the California High Speed Rail Authority’s project aims to begin service around 2029, according to CEO Brian Kelly. But none of these projects are remotely near complete, and any one of them could be derailed along the way. Amtrak is planning some minor speed upgrades. Improvements along the Northeast Corridor will allow Amtrak’s latest Acela trains to hit a top speed of around 160 miles per hour, but that will only be possible along about 35 miles worth of track between Boston and New Haven, Conn. Amtrak says Acela trains generally operate at 100-135 miles per hour across most of the Northeast Corridor, though its timetables suggest average speeds of up to 90 miles per hour. By contrast, true high-speed rail systems in countries like Japan and France can reach up to 200 miles per hour for long stretches of rail. But true high-speed rail isn’t on the table for Amtrak, which is in desperate need of basic repairs and other investments before major upgrades are possible. Still, Amtrak riders may be able to expect smaller improvements in the near future, like more frequent trains and service in new cities, including Chattanooga, Tenn. and Columbus, Ohio. “As we look to grow, as we look to those very large communities that have no or very little passenger rail service today, a large part of that growth will occur on freight rail infrastructure,” he says. That may be a sensible short-term strategy. After all, it’s easier to put more trains on existing lines than it is to build high-speed rail, which requires massive investments as well as solutions to problems like land rights. But the plan may not attract riders. Amtrak lines that rely on freight rail often suffer from delays, as freight trains get priority over their passenger-hauling cousins, contributing to Amtrak’s reputation for slow service. Moreover, Christopher Barkan, a professor at the University of Illinois and executive director of the Rail Transportation and Engineering Center (RailTEC), says that running more passenger trains on freight lines could cut into freight rail operators’ profits. “They have just enough infrastructure to meet their needs,” says Barkan. “So if we’re going to add passenger trains to this network, then we need to add infrastructure and a more sophisticated control system.” “Amtrak trains operate over the control systems freight railroads have installed throughout their networks for their freight operations, and most freight railroad main lines already have positive train control systems that are required if passenger train operations exceed certain thresholds,” says an Amtrak spokesperson. “Amtrak has the right to add additional trains on any rail line without infrastructure investments unless the freight railroad proves that the added trains would ‘impair unreasonably freight transportation.'” Some rail advocates argue that getting U.S. train speeds on par with that of other countries is the only way to get Americans riding the rails again—and there are environmental gains to boot, as high-speed lines are typically electrified, eliminating the need for diesel engines. At least one U.S. Congressman is pushing the Biden Administration to think bigger. “If we just put more passenger trains on already congested freight lines, people are not going to leave their cars to ride the train,” says Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton, a Democrat. In December of last year, he introduced a bill calling for the construction of an ambitious national high-speed rail system. His American High-Speed Rail Act, currently referred to committee, calls for $205 billion in federal investment over five years, and would “foster a growing national high-speed rail network, including allowing the designation of new corridors,” per a summary from his office, as well as encourage public-private partnerships, a strategy shown to be successful in countries like Japan. “Americans will ride the train if the service is better, that’s the bottom line,” adds Moulton. “If you have the choice between a five-to-six hour drive in congested traffic, or a 90-minute trip with a huge reclining seat and bar service, you’ll take the train.” For now, Flynn is hoping that a more realistic strategy will help Amtrak find its way out of the pandemic and back into Americans’ hearts, especially as people feel increasingly comfortable traveling as mass vaccination continues. “There’s so much latent capability in the existing structures that need, in some places, reinvestment where…we can build out train schedules and services that you and I would want to take,” says Flynn. “That investment has to be key to the strategy, the national strategy.”   Correction: The original version of this story misstated the amount of high-speed rail in the U.S. 173 miles of Amtrak’s system qualify as high-speed rail, not zero. It also misstated the maximum speed of Amtrak’s upcoming Acela trains. It is 160 mph, not 155 mph. It also misstated the top speed of Amtrak trains running along the Northeast Corridor. They can reach speeds up to 150 miles per hour, not 90 miles per hour.

In 2020 carbon emissions fell by a record 5.8% as restrictions placed on daily life to slow the spread of COVID-19 drove global demand for energy sharply down. But this year, as governments roll out economic stimulus packages and vaccine campaigns, demand is on track to rise above 2019 levels.  The projected single-year increase in emissions is topped only by 2010, the IEA says, when emissions soared as the global economy rebounded from the 2008 financial crisis. Read more: The Pandemic Remade Every Corner of Society. Now It’s the Climate’s Turn Though emissions remain 1.2% below their 2019 peak, the new figures are worrying for researchers as they suggest governments are pouring resources into fossil fuels in a bid to revive their economies, despite many world leaders’ promises to deliver a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. “This is a dire warning that the economic recovery from the Covid crisis is currently anything but sustainable for our climate,” said Fatih Birol, IEA Executive Director, in a statement. “Unless governments around the world move rapidly to start cutting emissions, we are likely to face an even worse situation in 2022.” Demand for coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, is projected to surge 4.5% this year compared to 2020, with its growth far outpacing renewables, even as clean energies, such as wind and solar have become cheaper than coal in many cases. Though coal use is likely to rise slightly in both the E.U. and the U.S., more than 80% of coal’s projected growth is concentrated in Asia. China’s government ramped up plans for new coal-fired power stations during the pandemic, a move climate campaigners say contradicts the country’s pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2060. China’s coal-fired power plants account for around one third of global coal consumption.

{"type": "article", "header": null, "author": null, "update_date/publish_date": null, "link_to_article": "https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2019-greta-thunberg/", "text": " Greta Thunberg sits in silence in the cabin of the boat that will take her across the Atlantic Ocean. Inside, there’s a cow skull hanging on the wall, a faded globe, a child’s yellow raincoat. Outside, it’s a tempest: rain pelts the boat, ice coats the decks, and the sea batters the vessel that will take this slight girl, her father and a few companions from Virginia to Portugal. For a moment, it’s as if Thunberg were the eye of a hurricane, a pool of resolve at the center of swirling chaos. In here, she speaks quietly. Out there, the entire natural world seems to amplify her small voice, screaming along with her.  “We can’t just continue living as if there was no tomorrow, because there is a tomorrow,” she says, tugging on the sleeve of her blue sweatshirt. “That is all we are saying.”  It’s a simple truth, delivered by a teenage girl in a fateful moment. The sailboat, La Vagabonde, will shepherd Thunberg to the Port of Lisbon, and from there she will travel to Madrid, where the United Nations is hosting this year’s climate conference. It is the last such summit before nations commit to new plans to meet a major deadline set by the Paris Agreement. Unless they agree on transformative action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the world’s temperature rise since the Industrial Revolution will hit the 1.5°C mark—an eventuality that scientists warn will expose some 350 million additional people to drought and push roughly 120 million people into extreme poverty by 2030. For every fraction of a degree that temperatures increase, these problems will worsen. This is not fearmongering; this is science. For decades, researchers and activists have struggled to get world leaders to take the climate threat seriously. But this year, an unlikely teenager somehow got the world’s attention.  Thunberg began a global movement by skipping school: starting in August 2018, she spent her days camped out in front of the Swedish Parliament, holding a sign painted in black letters on a white background that read Skolstrejk för klimatet: “School Strike for Climate.” In the 16 months since, she has addressed heads of state at the U.N., met with the Pope, sparred with the President of the United States and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike on September 20, 2019, in what was the largest climate demonstration in human history. Her image has been celebrated in murals and Halloween costumes, and her name has been attached to everything from bike shares to beetles. Margaret Atwood compared her to Joan of Arc. After noticing a hundredfold increase in its usage, lexicographers at Collins Dictionary named Thunberg’s pioneering idea, climate strike, the word of the year.  The politics of climate action are as entrenched and complex as the phenomenon itself, and Thunberg has no magic solution. But she has succeeded in creating a global attitudinal shift, transforming millions of vague, middle-of-the-night anxieties into a worldwide movement calling for urgent change. She has offered a moral clarion call to those who are willing to act, and hurled shame on those who are not. She has persuaded leaders, from mayors to Presidents, to make commitments where they had previously fumbled: after she spoke to Parliament and demonstrated with the British environmental group Extinction Rebellion, the U.K. passed a law requiring that the country eliminate its carbon footprint. She has focused the world’s attention on environmental injustices that young indigenous activists have been protesting for years. Because of her, hundreds of thousands of teenage “Gretas,” from Lebanon to Liberia, have skipped school to lead their peers in climate strikes around the world.  “This moment does feel different,” former Vice President Al Gore, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his decades of climate advocacy work, tells TIME. “Throughout history, many great morally based movements have gained traction at the very moment when young people decided to make that movement their cause.”  Thunberg is 16 but looks 12. She usually wears her light brown hair pulled into two braids, parted in the middle. She has Asperger’s syndrome, which means she doesn’t operate on the same emotional register as many of the people she meets. She dislikes crowds; ignores small talk; and speaks in direct, uncomplicated sentences. She cannot be flattered or distracted. She is not impressed by other people’s celebrity, nor does she seem to have interest in her own growing fame. But these very qualities have helped make her a global sensation. Where others smile to cut the tension, Thunberg is withering. Where others speak the language of hope, Thunberg repeats the unassailable science: Oceans will rise. Cities will flood. Millions of people will suffer.  “I want you to panic,” she told the annual convention of CEOs and world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January. “I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act.”  Thunberg is not a leader of any political party or advocacy group. She is neither the first to sound the alarm about the climate crisis nor the most qualified to fix it. She is not a scientist or a politician. She has no access to traditional levers of influence: she’s not a billionaire or a princess, a pop star or even an adult. She is an ordinary teenage girl who, in summoning the courage to speak truth to power, became the icon of a generation. By clarifying an abstract danger with piercing outrage, Thunberg became the most compelling voice on the most important issue facing the planet.  Along the way, she emerged as a standard bearer in a generational battle, an avatar of youth activists across the globe fighting for everything from gun control to democratic representation. Her global climate strike is the largest and most international of all the youth movements, but it’s hardly the only one: teenagers in the U.S. are organizing against gun violence and flocking to progressive candidates; students in Hong Kong are battling for democratic representation; and young people from South America to Europe are agitating for remaking the global economy. Thunberg is not aligned with these disparate protests, but her insistent presence has come to represent the fury of youth worldwide. According to a December Amnesty International survey, young people in 22 countries identified climate change as the most important issue facing the world. She is a reminder that the people in charge now will not be in charge forever, and that the young people who are inheriting dysfunctional governments, broken economies and an increasingly unlivable planet know just how much the adults have failed them.  “She symbolizes the agony, the frustration, the desperation, the anger—at some level, the hope—of many young people who won’t even be of age to vote by the time their futures are doomed,” says Varshini Prakash, 26, who co-founded the Sunrise Movement, a U.S. youth advocacy group pushing for a Green New Deal.  Thunberg’s moment comes just as urgent scientific reality collides with global political uncertainty. Each year that we dump more carbon into the atmosphere, the planet grows nearer to a point of no return, where life on earth as we know it will change unalterably. Scientifically, the planet can’t afford another setback; politically, this may be our best chance to make sweeping change before it’s too late.  Next year will be decisive: the E.U. is planning to tax imports from countries that don’t tackle climate change; the global energy sector faces a financial reckoning; China will draft its development plans for the next five years; and the U.S. presidential election will determine whether the leader of the free world continues to ignore the science of climate change.  “When you are a leader and every week you have young people demonstrating with such a message, you cannot remain neutral,” French President Emmanuel Macron told TIME. “They helped me change.” Leaders respond to pressure, pressure is created by movements, movements are built by thousands of people changing their minds. And sometimes, the best way to change a mind is to see the world through the eyes of a child.  ***  Thunberg is maybe 5 ft. tall, and she looks even smaller in her black oversize wet-weather gear. Late November is not the time of year to cross the Atlantic Ocean: the seas are rough, the winds are fierce, and the small boat—a leaky catamaran—spent weeks pounding and bucking over 23-ft. seas. At first, Thunberg got seasick. Once, a huge wave came over the boat, ripping a chair off the deck and snapping ropes. Another time, she was awakened by the sound of thunder cracking overhead, and the crew feared that lightning would strike the mast.  But Thunberg, in her quiet way, was unfazed. She spent most of the long afternoons in the cabin, listening to audiobooks and teaching her shipmates to play Yatzy. On calm days, she climbed on deck and looked across the vast colorless sea. Somewhere below the surface, millions of tons of plastic swirled. Thousands of miles to the north, the sea ice was melting.  Thunberg approaches the world’s problems with the weight of an elder, but she’s still a kid. She favors sweatpants and Velcro sneakers, and shares matching bracelets with her 14-year-old sister. She likes horses, and she misses her two dogs, Moses and Roxy, back in Stockholm. Her mother Malena Ernman is a leading Swedish opera singer. Her father Svante Thunberg is distantly related to Svante Arrhenius, a Nobel Prize–winning chemist who studied how carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the temperature on the earth’s surface.  More than a century after that science became known, Thunberg’s primary-school teacher showed a video of its effects: starving polar bears, extreme weather and flooding. The teacher explained that it was all happening because of climate change. Afterward the entire class felt glum, but the other kids were able to move on. Thunberg couldn’t. She began to feel extremely alone. She was 11 years old when she fell into a deep depression. For months, she stopped speaking almost entirely, and ate so little that she was nearly hospitalized; that period of malnutrition would later stunt her growth. Her parents took time off work to nurse her through what her father remembers as a period of “endless sadness,” and Thunberg herself recalls feeling confused. “I couldn’t understand how that could exist, that existential threat, and yet we didn’t prioritize it,” she says. “I was maybe in a bit of denial, like, ‘That can’t be happening, because if that were happening, then the politicians would be taking care of it.’”  At first, Thunberg’s father reassured her that everything would be O.K., but as he read more about the climate crisis, he found his own words rang hollow. “I realized that she was right and I was wrong, and I had been wrong all my life,” Svante told TIME in a quiet moment after arriving in Lisbon. In an effort to comfort their daughter, the family began changing their habits to reduce their emissions. They mostly stopped eating meat, installed solar panels, began growing their own vegetables and eventually gave up flying—a sacrifice for Thunberg’s mother, who performs throughout Europe. “We did all these things, basically, not really to save the climate, we didn’t care much about that initially,” says Svante. “We did it to make her happy and to get her back to life.” Slowly, Thunberg began to eat and talk again.  Thunberg’s Asperger’s diagnosis helped explain why she had such a powerful reaction to learning about the climate crisis. Because she doesn’t process information in the same way neurotypical people do, she could not compartmentalize the fact that her planet was in peril. “I see the world in black and white, and I don’t like compromising,” she told TIME during a school break earlier this year. “If I were like everyone else, I would have continued on and not seen this crisis.” She is in some ways grateful for her diagnosis; if her brain worked differently, she explained, “I wouldn’t be able to sit for hours and read things I’m interested in.” Thunberg’s focus and way of speaking betrays a maturity far beyond her years. When she passed classmates at her school, she remarked that “the children are being quite noisy,” as if she were not one of them.  In May 2018, after Thunberg wrote an essay about climate change that was published in a Swedish newspaper, a handful of Scandinavian climate activists contacted her. Thunberg suggested they emulate the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., who had recently organized school strikes to protest gun violence in the U.S. The other activists decided against the idea, but it lodged in Thunberg’s mind. She announced to her parents that she would go on strike to pressure the Swedish government to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Her school strike, she told them, would last until the Swedish elections in September 2018.  Thunberg’s parents were less than thrilled at first at the idea of their daughter missing so much class, and her teachers suggested she find a different way to protest. But Thunberg was immovable. She put together a flyer with facts about extinction rates and carbon budgets, and then sprinkled it with the cheeky sense of humor that has made her stubbornness go viral. “My name is Greta, I am in ninth grade, and I am school-striking for the climate,” she wrote on each flyer. “Since you adults don’t give a damn about my future, I won’t either.”  On Aug. 20, 2018, Thunberg arrived in front of the Swedish Parliament, wearing a blue hoodie and carrying her homemade school-strike sign. She had no institutional support, no formal backing and nobody to keep her company. But doing something—making a stand, even if she was by herself—felt better than doing nothing. “Learning about climate change triggered my depression in the first place,” she says. “But it was also what got me out of my depression, because there were things I could do to improve the situation. I don’t have time to be depressed anymore.” Her father said that after she began striking, it was as if she “came back to life.”  On the first day of her climate strike, Thunberg was alone. She sat slumped on the ground, seeming barely bigger than her backpack. It was an unusually chilly August day. She posted about her strike on social media, and a few journalists came by to talk to her, but most of the day she was on her own. She ate her packed lunch of bean pasta with salt, and at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, when she’d normally leave school, her father picked her up and they biked home.  On the second day, a stranger joined her. “That was a big step, from one to two,” she recalls. “This is not about me striking; this is now us striking from school.” A few days later, a handful more came. A Greenpeace activist brought vegan pad thai, which Thunberg tried for the first time. They were suddenly a group: one person refusing to accept the status quo had become two, then eight, then 40, then hundreds. Then thousands.  By early September, enough people had joined Thunberg’s climate strike in Stockholm that she announced she would continue every Friday until Sweden aligned with the Paris Agreement. The Fridays for Future movement was born. By the end of 2018, tens of thousands of students across Europe began skipping school on Fridays to protest their own leaders’ inaction. In January, 35,000 schoolchildren protested in Belgium following Thunberg’s example. The movement struck a chord. When a Belgian environmental minister insulted the strikers, a public outcry forced her to resign.  By September 2019, the climate strikes had spread beyond northern Europe. In New York City, 250,000 reportedly marched in Battery Park and outside City Hall. In London, 100,000 swarmed the streets near Westminster Abbey, in the shadow of Big Ben. In Germany, a total of 1.4 million people took to the streets, with thousands flooding the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and marching in nearly 600 other cities and towns across the country. From Antarctica to Papua New Guinea, from Kabul to Johannesburg, an estimated 4 million people of all ages showed up to protest. Their signs told a story. In London: The World is Hotter than Young Leonardo DiCaprio. In Turkey: Every Disaster Movie Starts with a Scientist Being Ignored. In New York: The Dinosaurs Thought They Had Time, Too. Hundreds carried images of Thunberg or painted her quotes onto poster boards. Make the World Greta Again became a rallying cry.  Her moral clarity inspired other young people around the world. “I want to be like her,” says Rita Amorim, a 16-year-old student from Lisbon who waited for four hours in December to catch a glimpse of Thunberg.  In Udaipur, India, 17-year-old Vidit Baya started his climate strike with just six people in March; by September, it was 80 strong. In Brasilia, Brazil, 19-year-old Artemisa Xakriabá marched with other indigenous women as the Amazon was burning, then traveled to the U.N. climate summit in New York City. In Guilin, China, 16-year-old Howey Ou posted a picture of herself online in front of city government offices in a solo act of climate protest; she was taken to a police station and told her demonstration was illegal. In Moscow, 25-year-old Arshak Makichyan began a one-man picket for climate, risking arrest in a country where street protest is tightly restricted. In Haridwar, India, 11-year-old Ridhima Pandey joined 15 other kids, including Thunberg, in filing a complaint to the U.N. against Germany, France, Brazil, Argentina and Turkey, arguing that the nations’ failure to tackle the climate crisis amounted to a violation of child rights.  In New York City, 17-year-old Xiye Bastida, originally from an indigenous Otomi community in Mexico, led 600 of her peers in a climate walkout from her Manhattan high school. And in Kampala, Uganda, 22-year-old Hilda Nakabuye launched her own chapter of Fridays for Future after she realized that the strong rains and long droughts that hurt her family’s crops could be attributed to global warming. “Before I knew about climate change, I was already experiencing its effects in my life,” she says.  The activism of children has also motivated their parents. In São Paulo, Isabella Prata joined a group called Parents for Future to support child activists. Thunberg, she says, “is an image of all of this generation.”  It all happened so fast. Just over a year ago, a quiet and mostly friendless teenager woke up, put on her blue hoodie, and sat by herself for hours in an act of singular defiance. Fourteen months later, she had become the voice of millions, a symbol of a rising global rebellion.  ***  On Dec. 3, La Vagabonde docked beneath a flight path to Portugal’s largest airport. Thunberg and her father stood on the deck, waving to the hundreds of people that had gathered on a cold, sunny day to welcome them back to Europe. Above their heads, planes droned, reminders of how easily Thunberg could have crossed the ocean by air, and of the cost of that convenience: the roughly 124,000 flights that take off every day spill millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. “I’m not traveling like this because I want everyone to do so,” Thunberg told reporters after she walked, a little wobbly at first, onto dry land for the first time in weeks. “I’m doing this to send a message that it is impossible to live sustainably today, and that needs to change.”  Taking her place in front of a bank of television cameras and reporters, she went on. “People are underestimating the force of angry kids,” she said. “We are angry and frustrated, and that is because of good reason. If they want us to stop being angry then maybe they should stop making us angry.” When she was done speaking, the crowd erupted in cheers.  Her speeches often go straight to the gut. “You say you love your children above all else,” she said in her first big address at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Poland last December. “And yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.” The address went viral almost immediately. Over the course of the past year, she has given dozens of similar admonitions—to chief executives and heads of state, to thought leaders and movie stars. Each time, Thunberg speaks quietly but forcefully, articulating the palpable sense of injustice that often seems obvious to the very young: adults, by refusing to act in the face of extraordinary crisis, are being foolish at best, and corrupt at worst. To those who share her fear, Thunberg’s blunt honesty is cathartic. To those who don’t, it feels threatening. She refuses to use the language of hope; her sharpest weapon is shame.  In September, speaking to heads of state during the U.N. General Assembly, Thunberg pulled no punches: “We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth,” she said. “How dare you.”  Mary Robinson, the former President of Ireland who served as the U.N. climate envoy ahead of the Paris climate talks, spent years arguing that climate change would destroy small island nations and indigenous communities. The message often fell on deaf ears. “People would just sort of say, ‘Ah yeah, but that’s not me,’” she tells TIME. “Having children say, ‘We have no future’ is far more effective. When children say something like that, adults feel very bad.”  Cutting through the noise has earned Thunberg plenty of detractors. Some indigenous activists and organizers of color ask why a white European girl is being celebrated when they have been working on these same issues for decades. Thunberg herself sometimes appears frustrated at the media attention placed on her, and often goes out of her way to highlight other activists, especially indigenous ones. At a press conference in Madrid just before the mass march, she implores journalists to ask questions “not just to me,” but to the other Fridays for Future organizers on stage with her. “What do you think?” she asks the others, in an effort to broaden the conversation.  Some traditional environmental groups have also complained that the radical success of a teenage girl playing hooky has overshadowed their less flashy efforts to write and pass meaningful legislation. “They want the needle moved too,” says Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a veteran climate leader. “They would just want to be the ones that get the credit for moving it.” On the record, no major environmental group would say anything remotely negative.  Some of her opponents have attacked her personally. Online trolls have made fun of her appearance and speech patterns. In Rome, someone hung her in effigy off a bridge under a sign reading Greta is your God. In Alberta, the heart of Canada’s oil-drilling region, police had to step in to protect her after she and her father were followed by men yelling, “This is oil country.” Maxime Bernier, leader of the far-right People’s Party of Canada, tweeted that Thunberg is “clearly mentally unstable.” (He later walked back his criticism, calling her only a “pawn.”) Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Thunberg entirely: “I don’t share the common excitement,” he said on a panel in October. President Donald Trump mocked her sarcastically on Twitter as “a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.” After she tweeted about the killings of indigenous people in Brazil, the country’s President Jair Bolsonaro called her an insulting word that roughly translated to “little brat.” Thunberg has taken those criticisms in stride: she has co-opted both Trump and Bolsonaro’s ridicule for her Twitter bio.  It’s not always easy. No one, and perhaps particularly a teenage girl, would like to have their looks and mannerisms mocked online. But for Thunberg, it’s a daily reality. “I have to think carefully about everything I do, everything I say, what I’m wearing even, what I’m eating—everything!” she tells TIME during a train ride to Hamburg, Germany, last spring. “Everything I say will reach other people, so I need to think two steps ahead.” Sitting next to her father, she scrolls past hateful comments—the head of a Swedish sportswear chain appeared to be mocking her Asperger’s—then shrugs them off. So many people have made death threats against her family that she is now often protected by police when she travels. But for the most part, she sees the global backlash as evidence that the climate strikers have hit a nerve. “I think that it’s a good sign actually,” she says. “Because that shows we are actually making a difference and they see us as a threat.”  ***  It’s hard to quantify the so-called Greta effect partly because it’s mostly been manifest in promises and goals. But commitments count as progress when the climate conversation has been stuck in stasis for so long. In the U.S., Democrats have long given lip service to addressing global warming even as they prioritized other issues, while many Republicans have simply denied the science altogether. In countries now establishing a middle class, like China and India, leaders argue they should be allowed to burn fossil fuels because that’s how their richer counterparts got ahead.  Those debates end up papering over what is an urgent challenge by nearly every measure. Keeping global temperature rise to 1.5°C would require elected officials to act both immediately and dramatically. In the developed world, a rapid transition away from fossil fuels could sharply raise gas and heating prices and disrupt industries that employ millions of people. In the global south, reducing emissions means rethinking key elements of how countries build their economies. Emissions would have to drop 7.6% on average every year for the next decade—a feat that, while scientifically possible, would require revolutionary changes.  But the needle is moving. Fortune 500 companies, facing major pressure to reduce their emissions, are realizing that sustainability makes for good PR. In June, the airline KLM launched a “Fly Responsibly” campaign, which encouraged customers to consider abstaining from non-essential air travel. In July, the head of OPEC, the cartel that controls much of the world’s oil production, called climate strikers the “greatest threat” to his industry, according to the AFP. In September, workers at Amazon, Facebook and other major companies walked out during the climate strikes. And in November, the president of Emirates airline told the BBC that the climate strikers helped him realize “we are not doing enough.” In December, Klaus Schwab, the founder and CEO of the World Economic Forum, published a manifesto calling on global business leaders to embrace a more responsible form of capitalism that, among other things, forces companies to act “as a steward of the environmental and material universe for future generations.”  Hans Vestberg, the CEO of the telecom giant Verizon, says that companies are feeling squeezed about climate from all sides. “It’s growing from all the stakeholders,” he says. “Our employees think about it much more, our customers are talking much more about it, and society is expecting us to show up.”  Governments are making promises too. In the past year, more than 60 countries said they would eliminate their carbon footprints by 2050. Voters in Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden—especially young people—now list climate change as their top priority. In May, green parties gained seats in the European Parliament from Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and more. Those victories helped push the new European Commission president to promise “a Green Deal” for Europe. In the U.S., a recent Washington Post poll found that more than three-quarters of Americans now consider climate change a “crisis” or a “major problem.” Even Republican lawmakers who have long denied or dismissed climate science are taking note. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Republican House minority leader Kevin McCarthy acknowledged that his party “should be a little bit nervous” about changing attitudes on climate.  At the individual level, ordinary people are following Thunberg’s example. In Sweden, flying is increasingly seen as a wasteful emission of carbon—a change of attitude captured by a new word: flygskam, meaning “flight-shame.” There was an 8% drop in domestic flights between January and April according to Swedavia, which runs the nation’s airports, and Interrail ticket sales have tripled over the past two years. More than 19,000 people have signed a pledge swearing off air travel in 2020, and the German railway operator Deutsche Bahn reported a record number of passengers using its long-distance rail in the first six months of 2019. Swiss and Austrian railway operators also saw upticks on their night train services this year.  The Greta effect may be growing, but Thunberg herself remains unmoved. “One person stops flying doesn’t make much difference,” she says. “The thing we should look at is the emissions curve—it’s still rising. Of course something is happening, but basically nothing is happening.”  ***  Last spring, before she became a global icon, Thunberg enjoyed a semblance of calm and privacy. Now it’s bedlam wherever she goes. On the night train from Lisbon, she hides in the on-board kitchen to escape the lenses of dozens of cameras; when she is finally able to sneak into her cabin, she uses the moment of peace to write in her journal. When her train arrives in Madrid the next morning, the platform is again packed cheek-to-jowl with television cameras and reporters. Before stepping off the train and facing the pack, she wonders out loud how she can navigate the chaos. Even after she makes it inside the U.N. climate summit, she’s swarmed. Photographers jostle through throngs of teenagers in green face paint chanting “Gre-TA, Gre-TA!” while others erupt in a spirited call-and-response: “What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!”  A few yards away from the commotion, in one of the official conference spaces, a speaker stands in front of a handful of other adults and chuckled. Behind her, a screen shows a Power-Point presentation: “How do we empower young people in climate activism?”  Thunberg’s lonely strike outside Sweden’s Parliament coincided with a surge of mass youth protests that have erupted around the world—all in different places, with different impacts, but fueled by a changing social climate and shifting economic pressures. In Hong Kong, young activists concerned by Beijing’s tightening grip on the territory sparked a furious pro-democracy movement that has been going strong since June. In Iraq and Lebanon, young people dominate sweeping demonstrations against corruption, foreign interference and sectarian governance. The Madrid climate summit was moved from Chile because of huge protests over economic inequality that were kicked off by high school students. And in the U.S., young organizers opposed the Trump Administration on everything from immigration to health care and helped elect a new wave of equally young lawmakers.  The common thread is outrage over a central injustice: young people know they are inheriting a world that will not work nearly as well as it did for the aging adults who have been running it. “It’s so important to realize that we are challenging the systems we are in, and that is being led by young people,” says Beth Irving, 17, who came from Wales to demonstrate for sweeping changes on climate policy outside the U.N. summit. Thunberg is not aligned with any of these non-climate youth movements, but her abrupt rise to prominence comes at a moment when young people across the globe are awakening to anger at being cut a raw deal.  The existential issue of climate puts everyone at risk, but the younger you are, the greater the stakes. The scale of addressing climate change—the systemic transformation of economic, social and political systems—-animates young progressives already keen to remake the world. Karin Watson, 22, who came to the climate summit as part of a delegation from Amnesty International Chile, describes a tumultuous, interconnected and youth-led “social explosion” worldwide. She cannot disentangle her own advocacy for higher wages from women’s rights and climate: “This social crisis is also an ecological crisis—it’s related,” she says. “In the end, it’s intersectional: the most vulnerable communities are the most vulnerable to climate change.”  In the U.S., Jaclyn Corin, 19, one of the original organizers of the March for Our Lives anti-gun violence movement, framed the challenges at stake. “We can’t let these problems continue on for future generations to take care of,” she says. “Adults didn’t take care of these problems, so we have to take care of them, and not be like older generations in their complacency.”  These disparate youth movements are beginning to see some wins. In Hong Kong, after months of sometimes-violent protests by young people resisting Beijing’s authoritarian rule, the pro-democracy parties won major victories in the local elections in November. In the U.K., young people are poised to become one of the most decisive voting blocs, and political battle lines are drawn by age as well as class. One poll shows that more than half of British voters say the climate crisis will influence their votes in the coming elections; among younger voters, it’s three-quarters. In Switzerland, the two environmentalist parties saw their best results ever in the elections in October, and much of that support came from young people who were voting for the first time. In the U.S., the Sunrise activists have helped make climate change a central campaign issue in the 2020 presidential election. In September, the top 10 candidates for the Democratic nomination participated in a first-of-its-kind prime-time town hall on the issue.  “Young people tend to have a fantastic impact in public opinion around the world,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told TIME. “Governments follow.”  On Dec. 6, the tens of thousands of people flooding into Madrid to demonstrate for climate action pour off trains and buses and sweep in great waves through the heart of the city. Above their heads, the wind carries furious messages—Merry Crisis and a Happy New Fear; You Will Die of Old Age, I Will Die of Climate Change—and the thrum of chants and drumming rise like thunder through the streets. A group of young women and teenage girls from Spain’s chapter of Fridays for Future escort Thunberg slowly from a nearby press conference to the march, linking their arms to create a human shield. Once again, Thunberg was the calm in the eye of a hurricane: buffeted and lifted by the surging crowd, cacophonous and furious but also strangely joyful.  It takes them an hour just to reach the main demonstration. When Thunberg finally approaches the stage, she climbs in her Velcro shoes to a microphone and begins to speak. The drums fall silent, and thousands lean in to listen. “The change is going to come from the people demanding action,” she says, “and that is us.” From where she stands, she can see in every direction. The view is of a vast sea of young people from nations all over the world, the great force of them surging and cresting, ready to rise. —With reporting by Ciara Nugent/Copenhagen; Dan Stewart and Vivienne Walt/Paris  Write to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com and Justin Worland at justin.worland@time.com.

{"type": "article", "header": "Can Exercise Prevent Depression? Here’s What the Science Says", "author": "Jamie Ducharme", "update_date/publish_date": "January 25, 2019 2:37 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5511322/exercise-depression-mental-health/", "text": "Ask anyone who’s ever felt better after a workout, and they’ll tell you that exercise and mental health are related. Science backs up that gut feeling. Many studies have found that physical activity is linked to a lower risk of developing depression, and better outcomes for people who have it. But does exercise actually prevent depression, or are people who don’t have depression simply more likely to be active? A new study, published in JAMA Psychiatry, sheds some light on that question. Using genetic data from more than 600,000 adults enrolled in multiple genomic association studies, researchers found “more evidence than ever before that physical activity does play an important, and likely causal, role in reducing risk for depression,” says Karmel Choi, a clinical and research fellow in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental genetics at Massachusetts General Hospital and a co-author of the study. The researchers looked at one or more of several different measures: people’s genomes, their medical histories of depression and depressive symptoms and how much physical activity they got (as measured by wearable fitness trackers and self reports). Comparing this information, they identified several gene variants linked to a person’s likelihood to exercise, and others associated with a person’s likelihood of developing depression. People who had genetic markers linked to a greater likelihood of exercising were less likely to develop depression, but people with markers of depression were not less likely to exercise. This finding, they say, suggests that exercise can protect against depression, but depression does not inherently make someone less likely to exercise. “Physical activity is good for a lot of things,” says co-author Dr. Jordan Smoller, director of the Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It may have benefits not only for all kinds of aspects of your health, but also, it looks like, your risk of developing depression.” The new research is only the latest study to say that exercise may prevent depression. Here’s what else the science says about how exercise affects mental health. Exercise is not a cure for mental health issues, and depression itself can be an obstacle to getting enough physical activity. (Despite the findings of the JAMA study, plenty of anecdotal evidence suggests that many people with depression do find it difficult to exercise, for reasons including antidepressant side effects like fatigue and weight gain, and how difficult it can be to find the energy to exercise.) But while exercise is not a perfect solution for depression, studies have shown that it can make a difference. One 2018 review of studies found that physical activity — specifically resistance training, like weight-lifting — can reduce symptoms of depression, perhaps even as effectively as conventional treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy and medication for some people. Other studies have found that virtually any type of workout, from cardio to yoga, can lessen depressive symptoms. It’s still unclear how exercise may achieve these effects, but researchers have theories. Rigorous workouts, like weight-lifting and running, may increase blood flow to the brain, potentially altering its structure and cellular makeup. Exercise can also trigger the release of mood-boosting endorphins. Yoga’s emphasis on breath work and mindfulness may also play a part. Research is finding that even small amounts of exercise improve both physical and mental health. “If instead of sitting down for 15 minutes you ran for 15 minutes, or if instead of sitting down for an hour you walked briskly for an hour, that’s the level of activity that might actually make a difference,” says Stoller, co-author of the new JAMA study. Using data from more than 1.2 million U.S. adults, a large study from 2018 found that people could achieve better mental wellbeing by doing as little as two hours of exercise each week (about 20 minutes per day). It even said that doing too much exercise — more than six hours per week — may backfire psychologically. One study from 2017 came to an even more doable conclusion: that just an hour of exercise a week may be enough to prevent depression. Finding the motivation to exercise can be easier if you expand the definition of what it means to be active. Choi, the JAMA study co-author, says that even “things like taking the stairs, or walking to the store, or washing dishes, or putting away laundry” — which people might not view as exercise — “could add up together to have beneficial effects on depression.” In a 2017 study, light exercise like walking was actually more beneficial to mental health than vigorous exercise. The recently updated federal physical activity guidelines also say that all types of movement can contribute to meaningful physical and mental health benefits, even if they’re accumulated in tiny chunks. If getting to the gym feels like a herculean task, start small. Even a short walk can put you on the path to better mental health.

{"type": "article", "header": "A Third of Americans Are Sleep-Deprived. This Technology Could Help Them Rest Easier", "author": "Jamie Ducharme", "update_date/publish_date": "January 25, 2019 12:47 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5494363/sleep-artificial-intelligence/", "text": "Despite the fact that we spend roughly a third of our lives snoozing (or at least trying to), sleep is not well understood by scientists — to say nothing of the estimated 35% of Americans who don’t get enough of it. Part of the problem is how difficult it is to study slumber. Experiments currently require individuals to come into a hospital or laboratory, cover themselves with an army of electrodes and allow a team of doctors to observe their attempts to drift off. “It’s kind of a nightmare,” says Dr. Emmanuel Mignot, director of the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. “They’re hooked up to all these things and they can barely move.” This environment can make it challenging to capture data about normal sleep and is often prohibitively expensive to maintain for longer than a night or two — a necessity for researchers looking to understand trends over time. “When you are a patient, when you have problems, the last thing you want to do is add to those problems by having to wear sensors, or take measurements or write diaries about how you feel,” says Dina Katabi, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. “If we can monitor health continuously but passively in a patient’s natural environment, that can help dramatically.” Experts say artificial intelligence (AI) might help researchers do just that. “It has the potential of changing sleep medicine entirely,” says Mignot. “Sleep is going through a revolution.” In 2017, Katabi and her team tested a way to monitor sleep information without any wires or electrodes. Instead of FDA-approved sleep staging devices, they used a device that emits radio frequency signals that bounce off the body. Because even tiny movements — think muscular twitches or blood pulsing, not rolling over or kicking a leg — alter the way these signals travel, the researchers developed an AI algorithm that would associate the data obtained from the radio waves with certain stages of sleep. In a trial monitoring 25 people, they found that the AI system could accurately guess an individual’s sleep stage about 80% of the time using only radio signal data, providing valuable information about their overall rest quality and problems they might be experiencing. The device is currently available for research purposes, but it is not sold commercially. Katabi allows that some accuracy is lost without direct brain-activity monitoring, but she says the system offers huge advantages over traditional sleep studies, given how accessible and non-invasive it is — perks that could allow researchers to collect a higher volume of sleep data without inconveniencing patients. Once this data is collected, however, it still needs to be analyzed and interpreted. And here, too, AI could make an impact. Right now, sleep researchers manually pore over pages of sensor-generated data related to brain activity, eye movements, breathing patterns, leg kicks and more, and use it to make assessments about sleep quality and possible problems, such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy. But in a 2018 paper published in Nature Communications, Stanford’s Mignot and his colleagues showed that an AI system could use this data to detect sleep issues better than a human technician. First, they asked six technicians to examine and score a single set of sleep data, looking for abnormalities that could suggest narcolepsy. The researchers then averaged those scores to get a consensus value. Next, the researchers trained an AI system by showing it 3,000 sleep readings, so it could begin to associate certain conditions with specific data trends. Then they had the system score the same sleep data as the technicians. It got closer to the group’s consensus value than any single human did, suggesting that it was more accurate than the average technician. “You are doing better than the standard of care, and it’s cheaper and it’s faster and it’s more reproducible,” Mignot says. While the innovation has not yet been approved for clinical use, Mignot says the science is sound. But even as scientists like Mignot and Katabi are carefully studying AI and verifying their results with rigorous tests, consumer-facing companies are already jumping into bed with the technology. This month, sleep tech company BRYTE introduced a smart mattress that learns from data measured by internal sensors as well as feedback provided by the user until it can improve sleep by adjusting its temperature, support and surrounding light in real-time. Mattress company Eight also syncs its smart mattresses with an AI-powered sleep coach app that delivers sleep insights and recommendations based on the person’s sleep history; the bed can also be hooked up to other smart home features, such as lights and thermostats, to adjust environmental conditions automatically. Outside the mattress realm, the Apple Watch says it can automatically track sleep quality if users wear it to bed and uses the information it gathers to make personalized recommendations for better rest. And apps like Sonic Sleep (which uses a phone’s microphone to assess background noise and then employs an AI-powered algorithm to pick out the right audio to mask it) and Sleep.ai (which says it can detect sleep apnea, snoring and teeth grinding by analyzing sound samples) have also gotten in on the AI sleep space. Perhaps unsurprisingly for any parent who’s ever wondered why their baby won’t sleep soundly through the night, both researchers and brands are also interested in bringing AI’s power to the crib. Apps including Nod and Huckleberry ask parents to log detailed information about their kids’ sleep, and over time use AI to tailor recommendations on how to improve it, like adjusting bedtimes or feeding schedules. And Nanit’s forthcoming motion-sensing infant swaddle, which works with the brand’s HD-camera-equipped baby monitor to automatically track a child’s sleep, provides parents with AI-powered recommendations on how to improve it. The AI for Good Foundation also recently launched a research program aimed at gathering large amounts of sleep data from parents and their children, which will then be analyzed by AI algorithms to provide deeper insights into the connections between good sleep and good health. Right now, products and projects like these are primarily aimed at accomplishing a straightforward, if elusive, goal: Helping people get better sleep. But both Mignot and Katabi say the relationship between AI and sleep goes far deeper than simple shut-eye. “Sleep is very important,” Katabi says, “but sleep is not just sleep.” Precursors and symptoms of a range of chronic conditions manifest while we’re sleeping. Individuals with depression, for example, often also suffer from insomnia. And many people with Parkinson’s disease develop REM sleep behavior disorder — meaning they physically act out their dreams — decades before the emergence of telltale symptoms like tremors. Having access to a tool that could quickly and accurately pick up on these sleep disturbances could help treatment options, Mignot says. “Many of these diseases we need to be preventing; we can’t wait until the brain is gone,” Mignot says. “Sleep is the window to brain health in many, many cases.” Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3908631/snoozing-and-losing-with-sleep-apnea/", "http://time.com/5392591/apples-new-health-focused-apple-watch-can-call-for-help-if-you-fall-down/", "http://time.com/collection-post/5454441/nanit-plus-baby-monitor/"], "sentiment_score": 0.181360153256705, "subjectivity_score": 0.47569786535303776},

Zuckerberg’s announcement comes after the social network said earlier this month that nearly 500 accounts likely originating in Russia bought $100,000 worth of Facebook ads during the election. Facebook said it had previously shared the information with U.S. officials investigating Russian interference leading up to Election Day. On Thursday, Zuckerberg revealed a nine-step plan to stop states from interfering in one another’s elections via Facebook, noting that the amount of “problematic content” found so far is “relatively small.” “I wish I could tell you we’re going to be able to stop all interference, but that wouldn’t be realistic,” Zuckerberg said on Facebook. “There will always be bad people in the world, and we can’t prevent all governments from all interference. But we can make it harder. We can make it a lot harder. And that’s what we’re going to do.” Read Zuckerberg’s full statement below. I just went live a minute ago. Here’s what I said: Today is my first day back in the office after taking parental leave. It was really special to be with Priscilla and August after she was born, and to get to spend some more time with Max. While I was out on leave, I spent a lot of time with our teams on the question of Russian interference in the US elections. I made some decisions on the next steps we’re taking, and I want to share those with you now. First, let me say this. I care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity. Facebook’s mission is all about giving people a voice and bringing people closer together. Those are deeply democratic values and we’re proud of them. I don’t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy. That’s not what we stand for. The integrity of our elections is fundamental to democracy around the world. That’s why we’ve built teams dedicated to working on election integrity and preventing governments from interfering in the elections of other nations. And as we’ve shared before, our teams have found and shut down thousands of fake accounts that could be attempting to influence elections in many countries, including recently in the French elections. Now, I wish I could tell you we’re going to be able to stop all interference, but that wouldn’t be realistic. There will always be bad people in the world, and we can’t prevent all governments from all interference. But we can make it harder. We can make it a lot harder. And that’s what we’re going to do. So today I want to share the steps we’re taking to protect election integrity and make sure that Facebook is a force for good in democracy. While the amount of problematic content we’ve found so far remains relatively small, any attempted interference is a serious issue. Here are 9 things we’ll be working on over the next few months: 1. We are actively working with the US government on its ongoing investigations into Russian interference. We have been investigating this for many months, and for a while we had found no evidence of fake accounts linked to Russia running ads. When we recently uncovered this activity, we provided that information to the special counsel. We also briefed Congress — and this morning I directed our team to provide the ads we’ve found to Congress as well. As a general rule, we are limited in what we can discuss publicly about law enforcement investigations, so we may not always be able to share our findings publicly. But we support Congress in deciding how to best use this information to inform the public, and we expect the government to publish its findings when their investigation is complete. 2. We will continue our investigation into what happened on Facebook in this election. We may find more, and if we do, we will continue to work with the government. We are looking into foreign actors, including additional Russian groups and other former Soviet states, as well as organizations like the campaigns, to further our understanding of how they used our tools. These investigations will take some time, but we will continue our thorough review. 3. Going forward — and perhaps the most important step we’re taking — we’re going to make political advertising more transparent. When someone buys political ads on TV or other media, they’re required by law to disclose who paid for them. But you still don’t know if you’re seeing the same messages as everyone else. So we’re going to bring Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency. Not only will you have to disclose which page paid for an ad, but we will also make it so you can visit an advertiser’s page and see the ads they’re currently running to any audience on Facebook. We will roll this out over the coming months, and we will work with others to create a new standard for transparency in online political ads. 4. We will strengthen our ad review process for political ads. To be clear, it has always been against our policies to use any of our tools in a way that breaks the law — and we already have many controls in place to prevent this. But we can do more. Most ads are bought programmatically through our apps and website without the advertiser ever speaking to anyone at Facebook. That’s what happened here. But even without our employees involved in the sales, we can do better. Now, I’m not going to sit here and tell you we’re going to catch all bad content in our system. We don’t check what people say before they say it, and frankly, I don’t think our society shouldn’t want us to. Freedom means you don’t have to ask permission first, and that by default you can say what you want. If you break our community standards or the law, then you’re going to face consequences afterwards. We won’t catch everyone immediately, but we can make it harder to try to interfere. 5. We are increasing our investment in security and specifically election integrity. In the next year, we will more than double the team working on election integrity. In total, we’ll add more than 250 people across all our teams focused on security and safety for our community. 6. We will expand our partnerships with election commissions around the world. We already work with electoral commissions in many countries to help people register to vote and learn about the issues. We’ll keep doing that, and now we’re also going to establish a channel to inform election commissions of the online risks we’ve identified in their specific elections. 7. We will increase sharing of threat information with other tech and security companies. We already share information on bad actors on the internet through programs like ThreatExchange, and now we’re exploring ways we can share more information about anyone attempting to interfere with elections. It is important that tech companies collaborate on this because it’s almost certain that any actor trying to misuse Facebook will also be trying to abuse other internet platforms too. 8. We are working proactively to strengthen the democratic process. Beyond pushing back against threats, we will also create more services to protect our community while engaging in political discourse. For example, we’re looking at adapting our anti-bullying systems to protect against political harassment as well, and we’re scaling our ballot information tools to help more people understand the issues. 9. We have been working to ensure the integrity of the German elections this weekend, from taking actions against thousands of fake accounts, to partnering with public authorities like the Federal Office for Information Security, to sharing security practices with the candidates and parties. We’re also examining the activity of accounts we’ve removed and have not yet found a similar type of effort in Germany. This is incredibly important and we have been focused on this for a while. At the same time, it’s important not to lose sight of the more straightforward and larger ways Facebook plays a role in elections — and these effects operate at much larger scales of 100x or 1000x bigger than what we’re discussing here. In 2016, people had billions of interactions and open discussions on Facebook that may never have happened offline. Candidates had direct channels to communicate with tens of millions of citizens. Campaigns spent tens of millions organizing and advertising online to get their messages out further. And we organized “get out the vote” efforts that helped as many as 2 million people register to vote who might not have voted otherwise. Many of these dynamics were new in this election, or at much larger scale than ever before in history, and at much larger scale than the interference we’ve found. But we are in a new world. It is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation states attempting to subvert elections. But if that’s what we must do, we are committed to rising to the occasion. Our sophistication in handling these threats is growing and improving quickly. We will continue working with the government to understand the full extent of Russian interference, and we will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world, but also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere. Thanks for tuning in, and we’ll keep you updated with more soon.   Write to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4918984/mark-zuckerberg-daughter-august/", "http://time.com/4775707/andrew-mccabe-congress-testimony/", "http://time.com/4930532/facebook-russian-accounts-2016-election/"], "sentiment_score": 0.11989487429628276, "subjectivity_score": 0.40219320976363226},

Here’s What’s Going On", "author": "Sarah Frier / Bloomberg", "update_date/publish_date": "March 19, 2018 12:41 PM [ET] | March 19, 2018 10:33 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5205336/facebook-shares-fall/", "text": "Facebook Inc. shares posted their steepest drop since 2015 as U.S. and European officials demanded answers to reports that a political advertising firm retained information on millions of the social network’s users without their consent. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are calling on Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to appear before lawmakers to explain how U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica, the data-analysis firm that helped Donald Trump win the U.S. presidency, was able to harvest the personal information. Facebook has already testified about how its platform was used by Russian propagandists ahead of the 2016 election, but the company never put Zuckerberg himself in the spotlight with government leaders. The pressure may also foreshadow tougher regulation for the social network. U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have called on the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to bring in technology company CEOs, including from Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, for public questioning. In a letter Monday to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Klobuchar and Kennedy said they have “serious concern regarding recent reports that data from millions of American was misused in order to influence voters.” “The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,” the senators wrote. A hearing with the CEOs would allow the committee to learn “what is being done to protect Americans’ data and limit abuse of the platforms, as well as to assess what measures should be taken before the next elections.” Facebook on Friday said that a professor used Facebook’s log-in tools to get people to sign up for what he claimed was a personality-analysis app he had designed for academic purposes. To take the quiz, 270,000 people gave the app permission to access data via Facebook on themselves and their friends, exposing a network of 50 million people, according to the New York Times. That kind of access was allowed per Facebook’s rules at the time. Afterward, the professor violated Facebook’s terms when he passed along that data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook fell as much as 8.1 percent to $170.06 on Monday in New York, wiping out all of the year’s gains so far. That marked the biggest intraday drop since August 2015. Facebook found out about the breach in 2015, shut down the professor’s access and asked Cambridge Analytica to certify that it had deleted the user data. Yet the social network on Friday suspended Cambridge from its system, explaining that it had learned the information wasn’t erased. Cambridge, originally funded by conservative political donor Robert Mercer, on Saturday denied that it still had access to the user data, and said it was working with Facebook on a solution. A researcher who worked with the professor on the app is now currently an employee at Facebook, which is reviewing whether he knew about the data leak. The denials and internal inquiries did little to ease the criticism. Damian Collins, a British lawmaker, said Sunday that Zuckerberg or another senior executive should appear in front of his committee because previous witnesses have avoided difficult questions, creating “a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.’’ He added in an interview on British radio Monday that Zuckerberg should “stop hiding behind his Facebook page and actually come out and answer questions about his company.” The next few weeks represent a critical time for Facebook to reassure users and regulators about its content standards and platform security, to prevent rules that could impact its main advertising business, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights. “Changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives wrote in a note to investors. Facebook, meanwhile, has sought to explain that the mishandling of user data was out of its hands and doesn’t constitute a “breach” – a definition that would require the company to alert users about whether their information was taken, per U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules. Menlo Park, California-based Facebook no longer allows app developers to ask for access to data on users’ friends. But the improper handling of the data raises systemic questions about how much companies can be trusted to protect personal information, said Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways,” O’Connor said in a statement. “Communications technologies have become an essential part of our daily lives, but if we are unable to have control of our data, these technologies control us.

Facebook said in a blog post Friday that Cambridge Analytica received some user data through an app developer on its social network, violating its policies. In 2015, Facebook said Cambridge Analytica certified that it had destroyed the information. “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Facebook said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica and parent Strategic Communication Laboratories have been suspended from the social network, “pending further information,” Facebook said. Cambridge Analytica said in a Saturday statement it did nothing illegal and is ​in touch with Facebook in order to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. Originally funded by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer, Cambridge uses data to reach voters with hyper-targeted messaging, including on Facebook and other online services. It was hired to help with voter outreach by the Trump campaign, whose former campaign manager, Steve Bannon, had been on the company’s board. The company harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without permission, according to the New York Times, which cites interviews with former Cambridge employees, associates and documents. This allowed Cambridge to exploit the private social-media activity of these users in support of the Trump campaign. “They want to fight a culture war in America,” Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of the company’s leaders, according to the Times. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.” Referring to stories by the Times and the Guardian, Alex Stamos, Facebook’s head of security, wrote in a Twitter message that “it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach.’” “We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he wrote, calling the actions “innapropriate” in another tweet.Cambridge said it hired U.S. project Global Science Research in 2014 for a U.S. project, but that it subsequently became clear that the data from GSR wasn’t obtained “in line with Facebook’s terms of service.” ​ “No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,” it said in the statement. Facebook wrote in its statement that Aleksandr Kogan, a professor at the University of Cambridge, built an app that used Facebook’s login tools to obtain information about Facebook users and their friends, which the company’s policies allow. Then, in violation of policies, he subsequently shared that data with Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook found out in 2015, the parties involved told Facebook they destroyed the data. They didn’t. “Kogan did not break into any systems, bypass any technical controls, or use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed,” Stamos tweeted. “He did, however, misuse that data after he gathered it.” Facebook in 2015 stopped allowing app developers to gather friend data. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” Facebook said in the blog post. “We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.09085297418630754, "subjectivity_score": 0.35294612794612795},
{"type": "article", "header": "Is Our Obsession With Health Data Making Us Crazy?", "author": "Jamie Ducharme", "update_date/publish_date": "May 30, 2019 5:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5066561/health-data-tracking-obsession/", "text": "When Bri Cawsey started wearing a Fitbit, she thought it was simply a “really cool tool” for charting her runs. Slowly but surely, however, the British Columbia-based strength and conditioning coach began tracking everything—calories, macronutrients, fertility—and noticed the habit spiraling out of control. “It became a little bit of an obsessive habit, especially around the food,” Cawsey remembers. Eventually, she says, it got so bad that, if she didn’t research a meal’s calorie and nutrient breakdown in advance, she’d feel anxious and upset at restaurants. In 2014, after realizing that her once-healthy habit had turned hazardous, Wilson “broke up” with her Fitbit, detailing the decision in a post on her fitness blog. She’s been tracker-free ever since, save for a brief stint while training to qualify for the Boston Marathon, and recommends her clients stay that way, too. “It was this great sense of peace,” she says of ditching the data. “I wasn’t as critical with myself.” In a culture where wellness junkies use apps, websites and wearables to monitor every morsel that passes their lips, every step they take, every beat of their hearts, their sleep cycles, and their fitness progress, we have health insights we’ve never had before. But Dr. George Zgourides, a Texas-based psychologist, family medicine doctor and author of the 2002 book Stop Worrying About Your Health, says these boundless data can contribute to a culture of health anxiety. Increasingly, he’s noticing that people are excessively concerned about health issues to the point that it might be interfering with mental health, work and relationships. And while once these worriers might have stoked their fears only with “Dr. Google,” as Zgourides calls it, they’re now equipped with an army of apps and devices that can spit out personalized data on command. “Now that you can count every calorie and every step you’re taking, people that might have some tendency toward an obsession with or a focus on numbers, this feeds the behavior in a way that is not always helpful,” Zgourides says. In 2015, for example, researchers at Duke University in North Carolina found that activity-tracking can decrease enjoyment of whatever pastime someone is trying to quantify, and even lead people to do less of it when the trackers are off. A 2017 study published in the journal Eating Behaviors also found associations between the use of calorie-counting and/or fitness-tracking devices and eating disorder symptoms among college students. And a 2016 survey of female Fitbit users found that almost 60% felt like their days were controlled by their devices, and 30% said the gadget was an “enemy” that made them feel guilty. Even as these trackers grow more and more sophisticated, the pushback against them—for reasons ranging from mental health to consumer privacy—is mounting. Companies are even capitalizing by offering products that provide an alternative to data overload. Take Shapa, a scale made by a startup of the same name. Shapa doesn’t spit out your weight when you step on it. Instead, it aggregates three weeks of weigh-in data, and uses a color-coded system to tell users if they’re gaining pounds, holding steady or losing weight. The idea, says co-founder and behavioral scientist Dan Ariely, is to shift the focus away from incremental weight changes, and toward more meaningful patterns. “My weight can go up and down depending on when I went to the bathroom and how much salt I’ve had and when I peed last and how much I’m dehydrated,” Ariely says. “Giving people information about things going up and down within that range is just confusing and demotivating, and it’s not helping [them] understand the relationship between cause and effect.” Shapa’s approach is meant to help people see the connection between their recent behavior and their weight, without getting bogged down in the specific numbers. It’s designed to counteract other products in the wellness-tracking world, Ariely says, which tend to dump data on people without context or actionable advice. “A lot of the ‘quantified self’ is basically designed for computer algorithms, not for people,” he says. Food-diary app YouAte is doing something similar for dieting. Like many nutrition apps, it allows users to log their meals and snacks, but instead of tabulating calorie counts, it asks individuals to categorize their food choices as “on-path” or “off-path” and note how those choices made them feel, ideally fostering mindful—but not obsessive—eating. There’s also YouFood, a food-diary app that helps users track their choices through photos, so they can get a general sense of their nutrition habits rather than meticulously counting calories and macronutrients. That’s a smart strategy, says Jessica Setnick, a Texas-based registered dietitian and eating-disorder specialist. “Under almost no circumstances would I recommend calorie counting,” she says. “Ultimately, the goal is to not need to count calories at all, but to be able to follow internal cues for guidance.” Setnick says eating disorders existed long before Fitbits and diet apps, but allows that these gadgets can exacerbate underlying issues. The “tools” can become “weapons,” she says, and nutrition-information overload can be debilitating. “We have the most nutrition information of anywhere in the world, and yet it hasn’t necessarily made us Americans healthier at all,” she says. “The best information is really Michael Pollan-esque: Eat mostly plants, not too much, and enjoy your food. It’s very, very basic information that people need.” Cawsey, the former Fitbit addict, agrees. She says listening to internal cues, rather than health and fitness apps, has made her far happier, and healthier. “If you are one of those people who is attached to all your apps and gadgets, maybe try to take a break and notice how you feel without it and trust yourself to eat without your Fitbit or MyFitnessPal telling you what to eat,” she suggests. “Spending that time to just let it all go and just trust yourself, listen to yourself, was really healing.” Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/5592792/a-wake-up-call-on-smart-beds-and-sleep-apps-that-collect-your-data/", "http://time.com/money/4219887/michael-pollan-talking-money/"], "sentiment_score": 0.11330710250201778, "subjectivity_score": 0.47560868980360493},

A loud voice in her head told her that she was a bad person, a failure, better off dead. She cut herself in secret and told no one about the thoughts slamming around her brain, except her pediatrician, who dismissed them as normal teen angst. But her suicidal thoughts and behaviors didn’t stop. “I was so good at hiding it and kind of normalizing it.” She remembers thinking, “I just need to keep these to myself.” She did, all through her 20s and early 30s, until one September day in 2014 she drove three hours from her home in Rochester, N.Y., where no one would find her, and cut her neck and the veins down her arms. After struggling to hide her wounds for four days, she went to an emergency room. A doctor sent her home. “They didn’t think I was suicidal enough,” she says. Mossgraber was referred to an outpatient treatment program, but she couldn’t absorb any of the information; she went through the motions, all the while planning how she was going to kill herself. She withdrew from friends and skipped Sunday dinners with her family. “I was falling deeper and deeper into this despair,” she says. Three months later, she bought a jug of antifreeze, mixed it with Gatorade and woke up days later in the intensive-care unit. Once inside, she had a different experience. After doctors stabilized her, the psychiatric team helped her write a safety plan, a personalized guide for Mossgraber to follow to help her cope when she feels suicidal. They matched her with a specialist in a type of behavioral therapy that treats suicidal thoughts and actions. And they connected her to an outpatient program, where she would finally be diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given medication that worked. “I had a lot of great people who encouraged me to keep going, and get better, and go home and start this hard work of recovery,” she says. “People listened to me and treated me like a human being.” It saved her. Suicide is one of the most urgent health problems facing America today. It is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., claiming 47,000 lives per year—and likely more, given that many suicides are not reported. Recent federal numbers indicate that the nation’s suicide rates are the highest they’ve been since World War II; they’re rising in nearly every state and across age groups and ethnicities. Alarmingly, suicide rates for young people are now the highest this century; among people ages 10 to 24, the rate increased 56% from 2007 to 2017, according to federal data from October 2019. Suicides among active-duty members of the military have also increased over the past five years, the Department of Defense reported in September, and a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) report from the same month found that suicides by veterans are on the rise. Ten million Americans seriously considered suicide in 2018. “It’s an extremely serious problem, and the fact that suicide is increasing shows that we all need to do more and do better,” says Richard McKeon, chief of the suicide-prevention branch at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Suicide is complex, and it’s not clear what’s driving the rise, but experts speculate that many factors may be contributing, including high rates of drug abuse, stress and social isolation. It’s an expensive problem too. Attempted and completed suicides cost the U.S. up to $94 billion per year in lost work and medical expenses. Sign up for TIME’s guide to managing stress and anxiety. But a new approach is starting to yield positive results. For all the disparate reasons people die by suicide, they tend to have something in common: research suggests that 83% visit some kind of doctor in the year before their death. So health care facilities are logical places to prevent suicide. Hospitals and behavioral-health centers are now redesigning their practices to include research-backed interventions that have been studied for years but haven’t, until now, been widely used. In a world of high-tech, high-cost medicine, the new protocols for treating suicidal patients are surprisingly straightforward. They include thoroughly screening people, often with the help of electronic health records, in order to target those at risk; collaborating with patients to write safety plans to help them cope with suicidal episodes; quickly treating a person’s suicidal thoughts and behaviors rather than waiting to treat any underlying mental illness first; removing lethal means like guns (which are used in nearly half of all suicides and 69% of suicides by veterans in the U.S.) from patients’ homes; and supportively following up with patients via letters or phone calls in the days and weeks after they leave care, which is when many suicides happen. One of the biggest obstacles health systems face in preventing suicide is losing touch with people when they’re vulnerable. In most U.S. hospitals, a person who arrives at an emergency room after a suicide attempt is generally hospitalized, stabilized and, once deemed to be at lower risk, discharged with guidance to follow up with a mental-health professional. But many don’t take that advice. Even under less acute circumstances—when they’re receiving routine care—people fall through the cracks. The new best practices emphasize putting people on the grid and not letting go. Few places do it as well as Centerstone, a large community mental-health center based in Tennessee that obsessively follows up with patients. By reprogramming its digital health-records system, Centerstone made screening for suicide risk mandatory; patients who respond a certain way are automatically designated at risk and seen more frequently. If one of these patients doesn’t show up for an appointment and can’t be reached within a few minutes, a 24/7 crisis team is pinged. “They’re gonna come after you—in a loving, kind, gentle way, but they’re going to pull out all the stops to make contact with you so that we know that you’re not in any kind of major crisis,” says Becky Stoll, vice president for crisis and disaster management for Centerstone. One of these routine phone calls reached a patient as he was standing on the edge of a bridge ready to jump; the caller persuaded him to return to the clinic. Within two years of making this change and others in 2014, the rate of suicide deaths at Centerstone had dropped by 64%. Using electronic health records may even predict who’s at risk for suicide attempts or deaths in the wider population. In October, Kaiser Permanente will begin using a combination of patients’ health records and their answers to a short depression questionnaire to predict who’s most at risk in one of their mental-health clinics. (They plan to later expand to primary care.) When analyzed together, this data—which includes strong predictors like a person’s mental-health diagnoses and substance-use history—can instantly flag patients who are most at risk for suicide to a “surprisingly accurate” degree, says Dr. Gregory Simon, a psychiatrist and researcher at Kaiser Permanente Washington. Once it’s implemented, when at-risk patients have a doctors’ visit, their provider will be alerted to assess their risk for suicide. And if they don’t show up, someone will reach out to them. Once clinicians know whom they should be targeting, they can begin to intervene. One effective way to keep people safe from suicide is to take guns, pills or other lethal means out of their homes through discussions with patients and their families. “Most people who might be thinking of ending their lives have a particular means in mind,” says Mike Hogan, a suicide-prevention expert. “Ending your life is hard—it’s hard psychologically, and it’s hard physically—and if you take that one means away, most people won’t do something else.” Without the tools to carry out a plan, “if you can ride the wave a day or two, when the thoughts are at their most powerful, then the thoughts begin to abate,” says Julie Goldstein Grumet, director of health and behavioral-health initiatives for the Suicide Prevention Resource Center. “If you can really increase the time and the distance between the thoughts and the access, then we know the rates of suicide will go down.” Knowing how to fill that time is crucial. That’s where a safety plan—a guide that a patient and a provider write together, detailing what the person can do and who they can call when they’re in suicidal crisis—has been shown to be valuable. “We have typically worked on the development or implementation of more complex treatments for suicidal people,” says Barbara Stanley, co-developer of the safety planning intervention and professor of medical psychology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “And here you find something that is incredibly simple, very easy to train, pretty easy to implement, yet it seems to get just as good results in preventing suicide.” Health systems are rapidly adopting safety plans because of their simplicity and efficacy. Safety planning is now standard at every VA medical center. There are signs that health systems across the country will soon step up their suicide care. In July, the Joint Commission, the major accreditor of health care organizations in the U.S., imposed new rules requiring hospitals and behavioral-health centers to approach suicide prevention more systematically, with enhanced screening and improved counseling and follow-up care when at-risk patients leave care. “It used to be our standards were to refer someone to a suicide hotline, and that’s just not the state of the science at this point,” says Dr. David Baker, executive vice president for health care quality evaluation at the Joint Commission. The Veterans Health Administration, the country’s largest integrated health care system, has long prioritized suicide prevention but is also raising the bar; in 2017 it started offering same-day access to mental-health services across the VA, and in 2018 it began screening everyone for suicide risk. SAMHSA is funding $46 million in grants to help health systems implement suicide prevention and intervention programs. And researchers are currently testing how effective these types of interventions are at reducing suicides on a much larger scale: across six health care systems, including several Kaiser Permanente sites. It is one of the largest mental-health studies of all time. It might seem perverse that health care organizations don’t already prioritize suicide care. But for the most part, they don’t. “This whole notion of preventing suicide is quite radical,” says Dr. Justin Coffey, chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral health at Geisinger Health System. “For many of us, it’s antithetical to what we were taught in our clinical training. Suicide is traditionally understood as this tragic yet inevitable outcome of serious mental illness.” The old thinking was that you couldn’t stop people who have decided to kill themselves, so most providers received no formal training on how to care for suicidal patients. “And yet now we know it is indeed preventable,” Coffey says. This shift in thinking—and the hands-on approach now gaining traction—has its foundation in work started nearly 20 years ago. In 2001, the behavioral-health department of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit remade itself around the goal of completely eliminating suicide among its patients, using science-backed techniques like giving them quicker access to care and keeping in closer contact with them. Within two years, suicide rates among these patients dropped by more than 75% (and remained as low for over a decade). In 2008, the program reached its goal of zero suicides, a trend that lasted for more than a year. People in the suicide-prevention field took notice. “Nobody had ever seen results like this,” says Hogan. “This was the most effective suicide-prevention program, based on the data, that had ever been seen in the world.” With the Henry Ford experiment and the VA’s suicide-prevention program, which launched in 2007, as examples of what was possible in health care, in 2012 HHS published a national suicide-prevention strategy that prioritized health care systems for the first time—and set the goal of “zero suicides.” The name stuck. Zero Suicide became a collection of best practices for health care systems to use to reduce suicides among people under their care. “Over 1,000 organizations are now using the skills and tools of the Zero Suicide initiative,” says Goldstein Grumet, who is also director of the Zero Suicide Institute, which helps health care systems transform in this way. Baked into each step is the directive to acknowledge each patient’s pain, empower them to make safe decisions and build hope for recovery. The time after a person leaves care is delicate. Suicide risk rises sharply the first week after discharge from a psychiatric facility and remains high even years later. But there are opportunities to reduce suicide risk even after treatment is over. Back in the 1970s, Dr. Jerome Motto, a San Francisco psychiatrist, wanted to see whether writing patients a series of short letters to show them they weren’t alone—that someone cared—helped keep them alive. “The point always was, just be there for somebody,” says Chrisula Asimos, one of Motto’s former researchers. Motto and his colleagues found more than 800 people who had recently been hospitalized because they were severely depressed or suicidal, but who had refused further treatment. Half were left alone, and the others were sent a regular stream of short letters from a staff member who had met them in the hospital. “It has been some time since you were here at the hospital, and we hope things are going well for you,” one of the letters read. “If you wish to drop us a note we would be glad to hear from you.” They sent the letters every so often for the next five years. “Initially I was a little skeptical, because working with these patients in the hospital when they first came in, they were just acutely depressed or suicidal,” Asimos says. “But it became really clear when we started getting responses back that those contact letters were really a way to open the door.” The group who received letters had a lower suicide rate all five years of the study. Many wrote back. “I was surprised to get your letter,” read one response. “I thought that when a patient left the hospital your concern ended there.” “You will never know what your little notes mean to me,” read another. “You are the most persistent son of a bitch I’ve ever encountered,” read another, “so you must really be sincere in your interest in me.” This kind of follow-up contact for patients leaving care—which is also effective by phone, recent research suggests—is cost-saving and scalable through automation and electronic health records. A 2017 study found that follow-up letters and calls to people at elevated risk for suicide who left emergency departments reduced the likelihood of a new suicide in the next year by about a third and was cost-effective. “That’s a huge effect from something that’s super low intensity,” says study co-author Michael Schoenbaum, senior adviser for mental-health services, epidemiology and economics at the National Institute of Mental Health. “The holy grail in health care is something where you get more and pay less. And caring communications overwhelmingly seems to be that.” After Kristina Mossgraber left the hospital, she slowly got better. “Recovery is the hardest job I’ve ever had,” she says. “It’s physically and emotionally exhausting. But it’s worth it. My life is back to the way I’ve always wanted it to be.” She now works as director of education and community outreach at her local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, talking to kids in schools about mental health and suicide prevention. She’s also on an advisory board at the same hospital where she was once turned away—and later given tools, hope and access to a better life. “Unfortunately, the system has been one way for so very long. And the public perception of mental health and suicide has been one way for so very long,” she says. “It’s going to take a while. But I’m encouraged. I really think things are changing.” If you or someone you know may be contemplating suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. In emergencies, call 911 or seek care from a local hospital or mental-health provider.

But increasingly, women — and their doctors — are asking artificial intelligence (AI) to do that math for them. AI is an area of computer science in which machines learn to complete complex tasks and adapt their performance based on past results. In the fertility world right now, AI most commonly turns up in consumer apps like Flo, which uses the technology to fine-tune its predictions about ovulation and fertility based on self-reporting on things like menstrual cycles, physical symptoms, sexual activity and more. There’s also the AI-powered Mira, which asks users to not only enter information about their health but also to take an at-home urine test that allows the app to track hormone levels in order to provide personalized fertility advice. But in the future, doctors may further harness the power of AI to help women looking to conceive. And improving in vitro fertilization (IVF), the most common type of artificial reproductive technology, may be one of the most promising applications. At the moment, each cycle of IVF can cost around $12,000, not including medications that can add thousands more dollars to the total expense. And once a woman is over the age of 35, her chances of delivering a single full-term baby of normal birth weight with IVF are less than 20% per cycle — meaning both the financial and the emotional costs can be significant. But if doctors could get better at pinpointing the embryos most likely to result in healthy babies, they could potentially increase IVF’s success rate. Last year, Dr. Nikica Zaninovic, an embryologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, co-authored a study in which an AI system was shown tens of thousands of images of embryos and told which ones resulted in a live birth. Then, looking at images of transferred embryos, it was able to correctly guess their viability over 70% of the time. In April, Zaninovic and his colleagues published a second study in the journal NPJ Digital Medicine. For the study, the researchers trained an AI algorithm with about 50,000 images of embryos of varying quality. Once trained, the algorithm could identify high- and low-quality embryos with about 97% accuracy, the researchers found — a rate that outperformed many trained embryologists. While the algorithm alone cannot predict pregnancy rates, the paper says, having accurate information about embryo quality may boost a couple’s chances of conceiving. Zaninovic doesn’t think AI will replace doctors but says it will play a significant role in medicine in the future. While AI can process and learn from millions of data points, he explains, “Human beings have limitations.” But before AI can be used this way in fertility clinics, more research must be done. Zaninovic says the next step is to conduct a study in which an embryologist selects embryos to transfer for one group of women and AI selects for another, and scientists compare the results. Meanwhile, other researchers are working on similar applications. Australian startup Life Whisperer last year partnered with a U.S. IVF provider to test “AI-driven image analysis” technology it says can instantly assess embryo viability. Another AI-based system, Ivy, is being tested in Australia. Dr. Jessica Spencer, director of the department of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the Emory University School of Medicine, sees even more potential for AI in this field, given the number of variables involved in starting a family. One day, she says, AI could help doctors assess a couple’s infertility risk before they even start trying to have a child, or suggest a customized protocol for a woman planning to do IVF. Doctors currently consider factors like age, egg counts and hormone levels when making these decision, but they don’t have algorithms to guide them. “You could input all this data, and then it could tell you based on prior published studies, and perhaps even based on patients who have come through your clinic or a national database, how she might respond based on those tests,” Spencer explains. “That’s what we do in our brains, but it’s probably not done in as smart and precise a way as a computer could do it.” Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/3418735/signs-your-hormones-out-of-whack/", "http://time.com/5098000/ivf-success-pregnancy-embryos/", "http://time.com/4753310/ivf-10-times-lessons/", "http://time.com/4343929/infertility-struggle/"], "sentiment_score": 0.12381910439287488, "subjectivity_score": 0.46169824710808316},
{"type": "article", "header": "Exclusive: Instagram Hits 500 Million Users", "author": "Olivier Laurent", "update_date/publish_date": "June 21, 2016 9:00 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4375747/instagram-500-million-users/", "text": "Just eight months after celebrating its fifth birthday, Instagram is celebrating a new milestone: half a billion monthly active users, 300 million of whom use the photo-sharing service daily. “It’s a big milestone for us because we set to create a community, not just a photo-sharing app,” Instagram co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom tells TIME in an exclusive interview. “One of the things we said early on is that everyone can create a photo-sharing app, but not everyone can build a community that lasts. And [these 500 million users] are not in silos. They are all interacting with each other. It’s a global community, with over 80% of those people outside of the United States.” For Systrom, the magic number brings to life the vision he had when he started Instagram with Mike Krieger in 2010. Yet with hundreds of millions of people on the platform, it also runs the risk of losing the personal aspect that made it successful in the first place. Last month, Instagram started using an algorithm to predict which photos its users are more likely to want to see, with those pictures appearing higher in their feeds. It’s similar to the system used by Facebook, which acquired Instagram in 2012 in a roughly $1 billion deal. Some users balked at the change, a common reaction when a popular social media platform makes a big tweak. But Systrom sees the move as a way to surface the best content from the 95 million images and videos shared on the platform every day. Read next: Why Instagram’s Big Change Is a Good Thing For Users “The community feel is all about who you connect with,” says Systrom. “I feel a big part of the change we’re doing with the non-chronological feed is to resurface the content from people you want to interact with the most and the people you have a history of interacting with the most. So in a world where we have more people, we make sure that your feed feels small. That it still feels personalized to you.” The change is part of Instagram’s push to reach one billion users, a marker thus far reached only by Facebook. “We know that these next 500 million people don’t look like the 500 million people that we on-boarded already, meaning they use different phones, they are likely from other countries, different ages, different interests, different backgrounds, and it’s up to us to make sure that the product feels local in every market, and that we’re optimized for each and every phone.” As part of that effort, Instagram has hired teams of community editors and marketers in international markets to “put the finger on the pulse of these markets and help us understand what we should be doing to scale locally,” says Systrom. “That’s really the focus of growth going forward.” Instagram is also investing in the creation of new content for the platform through various partnerships. It had arrangements with Vogue’s Met Gala to the Coachella music festival, for instance. It also created an up-close look at an amphibious assault ship ahead of New York City’s Fleet Week. “We see them less as partnerships and more as teaming up to let great things happen,” says Systrom. “We like to unlock those features and unlock those possibilities for each and every user on Instagram. It must help growth and must help make the transition to video and, if nothing else, it means that there’s great stuff to see on Instagram.” Read next: Instagram Photographers to Follow in All 50 States As with all social media platforms these days, Instagram is pushing heavily on video. That effort has taken on increased importance given the rise of Snapchat, a rival app that is predominantly video-based. Video is a challenge for Instagram because users have long associated the platform with still images, and consumer behavior is hard to change. But Instagram says that it has seen a 150% jump in the amount of time users spend watching videos in the app over the last six months. “I’m very excited about that because we all believe that video is the next big medium for living and understanding the world as it happens,” says Systrom. Instagram is now focused on convincing its users to share even more videos. “The real challenge is: how do you make a system like Instagram accept videos from consumers in a way where you don’t feel you have to get as many likes?” To achieve that, Instagram recently switched to a view count for videos posed on the platform, rather than the “likes” that appear with photos. “If you change the language, if you change the feedback, you actually get more of them and I think people are more likely to post.” Yet the number of videos shared on the platform remains low compared to still images. But Systrom is convinced this will change. “[If you look] at people’s camera rolls on their phones, you’ll see mostly photos and every now and then a video. I believe this will change in the future.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4273531/instagram-algorithm/", "http://time.com/4273531/instagram-algorithm/", "http://time.com/4273531/instagram-algorithm/", "http://time.com/instagram50/"], "sentiment_score": 0.1573989898989899, "subjectivity_score": 0.42021885521885527},

Like Facebook and Twitter before it, the photo-sharing app will soon be getting rid of its chronological feed.  The social network said March 15 that it will begin using algorithms to personalize users’ feeds based on their interests and relationships, rather than showing photos in chronological order.  “The order of photos and videos in your feed will be based on the likelihood you’ll be interested in the content, your relationship with the person posting and the timeliness of the post,” reads an Instagram blog post. “As we begin, we’re focusing on optimizing the order — all the posts will still be there, just in a different order.” According to Instagram, the average user misses 70 percent of the photos that come into their feeds. Using an algorithm could help the company ensure that the few posts a user does actually see are of high interest. In turn, users may then spend more time on the app, viewing more ads and boosting Instagram’s business. The turn to algorithms was likely inevitable given that Instagram is owned by Facebook, the social network whose secretive News Feed algorithm is one of the keys to its success. Facebook uses thousands of factors to determine which posts to show to individual users. The algorithmic feed has helped Facebook grow to 1.5 billion users and demonstrably improved engagement metrics. But many users don’t even know it exists, and studies have shown they become shocked and angry when they discover Facebook is pulling the strings in their social interactions.  Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger believes Instagram will face less pushback because the network centers on photos rather than words.“Look at my feed now. I follow accounts from all over the world,” he told The New York Times. “It doesn’t really matter to me what time it is.” Instagram will begin rolling out an algorithmically driven feed with a small set of test users, with plans for a broader rollout in the coming months.

Another face is based on Apple’s Breathe app, which guides users through a deep breathing exercise. Thanks to a new accelerometer and gyroscope, the new Apple Watch can tell if a wearer falls. Upon detecting a fall, it will ask if the user needs help. If the Apple Watch doesn’t detect any movement for one minute, it will automatically send your location to emergency responders. Along similar health-minded lines, the Apple Watch Series 4 can tell if your heart rate drops too low, or if you have an irregular heartbeat that may suggest atrial fibrillation. The new Apple Watch also allows users to take an electrocardiogram, or ECG. A built-in app can then check the results for potential problems, as well as record the data for users to share with medical experts. “This is the first ECG product offered over-the-counter directly to consumers,” said Williams. (AliveCor’s KardiaBand, an Apple Watch accessory, and KardiaMobile, which works with iPhones and other mobile devices, offer similar functionality.) The new Apple Watch has clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Williams added. Williams said the Series 4 was designed to better handle phone calls with a new speaker, microphone, and construction that lets radio waves more easily pass through the rear of the device. The Apple Watch Series 4 has 18-hour “all-day battery life,” Williams said. The new Apple Watch will be available in an array of stainless and aluminum options starting at $399 on Sept. 21, with pre-orders beginning Friday. An option with built-in cellular connectivity will run $499. The older Series 3 model will still be available, but at the cheaper price of $279. The new Apple Watch may help the company capture more of the smartwatch market as we head into the typically lucrative holiday buying season. Apple has just under 20% of that market as of the second quarter, according to research firm IDC.     Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4367172/apple-breathe-app/"], "sentiment_score": 0.14054112554112555, "subjectivity_score": 0.3961688311688312},

He may wreak bedtime Havoc on his Bunkmate, but his snoring may also signal that something serious is going on under the hood. Not all people who snore have an underlying health problem. But those with sleep apnea, a disorder in which people momentarily stop breathing while they sleep, nearly always snore. Experts speculate that the number of people with the disorder is on the rise–up to 25 million Americans, most of them men–because of obesity. Although the disorder requires a visit to a sleep specialist to diagnose, the consequences of untreated sleep apnea are as serious as they are unexpected. A new study found that men with the disorder were twice as likely to be depressed as men without it. But breathing devices, lifestyle changes and surgery can improve the overall health of unknowing sufferers (not to mention that of their bedmates). How Sleep Apnea Works In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a blockage or collapse in the airway makes it hard for oxygen to reach the lungs. The air that does get through the blockage can result in snoring. That lack of air in the lungs–not the snoring–causes blood-oxygen levels to plummet, leading the brain to interrupt sleep. In central sleep apnea, which is less common, the brain doesn’t correctly send signals to the muscles that control breathing. As with OSA, that lack of airflow lowers blood-oxygen levels, which triggers the brain to interrupt sleep, sometimes resulting in a gasp. This often happens repeatedly throughout the night.

The core recommendations in the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, which were published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, aren’t all that different from the previous iteration, which was released in 2008. The tone, however, has shifted to include more manageable forms of activity and to promote benefits of exercise that go beyond physical health, such as improved cognitive function, mental health and sleep quality — changes that may encourage more Americans to adhere to the standards. Just as they did in 2008, the guidelines urge American adults to shoot each week for at least 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise (such as running), at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) or some combination of the two. In addition, the guidelines say adults should aim to complete muscle-strengthening activities, such as resistance training or weight-lifting, at least two days per week. But the new guidelines take a more approachable tack than in years past, urging adults to simply “move more and sit less throughout the day,” and reminding them that “some physical activity is better than none.” (The latter message was also included in the previous version.) The updated recommendations also specify that physical activity can be accumulated throughout the day, even through short activities like taking the stairs or picking a far-away parking spot. Previously, only activities lasting 10 minutes or longer met HHS’ criteria. The same general standards apply to older adults, though the guidelines say that elderly individuals should prioritize activities that combine muscle-strengthening, balance and aerobic exercise, which can help make up for bone and muscle loss that comes with aging. Older adults should also tailor their activity levels to their health capabilities, the guidelines say. Time and intensity recommendations are less stringent for children, but the guidelines still encourage kids to keep moving to avoid excess weight and heightened risks of chronic disease. New this year, the guidelines include a recommendation for preschool-aged children, who they say should generally aim to “be physically active throughout the day.” School-aged children and adolescents should aim for at least an hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day, including muscle- and bone-strengthening exercises on some days, according to the guidelines. The standards also include specific recommendations for pregnant women, for whom physical activity may reduce the risk of complications such as gestational diabetes and excessive weight gain. All pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week, the paper says, while those who were very active before pregnancy can likely continue with their regular routines. The guidelines do note that health benefits tend to accumulate as physical activity level increases — so adults who can get 300 or more minutes of exercise per week should do so. Nonetheless, research has shown that even modest amounts of light physical activity, such as walking, cleaning and running errands, can come with benefits including better mental health and longevity. So while everyone should aim to hit or exceed the guidelines, the most important thing is to fit in more activity, however and whenever it works for you.

But do you really need to break a sweat to reap those benefits? A new study in the Journal of Health Psychology says no: Simply getting up and moving around seems to reduce feelings of depression, say researchers at the University of Connecticut. Light physical activity was actually associated with the biggest emotional benefit in the study, compared to moderate and high-intensity exercise. No association was found between emotional state and vigorous physical activity, but that can still be considered good news, say the authors. The finding contradicts a previous study that suggested vigorous exercise could actually worsen psychological wellbeing. The study included 419 middle-age adults who completed health and activity questionnaires, and then wore activity trackers for four days. In line with previous research, people who reported higher levels of sedentary behavior over the last six months also reported lower levels of subjective wellbeing. In other words, they were the least happy.  When the researchers looked at the participants’ activity over those four days (two weekdays and one weekend), they found that people who did light-intensity activities, like leisurely walking, reported the highest levels of wellbeing and lowest levels of depression. People who participated in moderate-intensity physical activity, which typically involves sweating and an increase in heart rate and breathing, also reported higher-than-average levels of wellbeing, and lower levels of pain, as well. Some people benefited from physical activity more than others. When the researchers factored in people’s self-reported physical activity levels, they found that those wellbeing boosts—for both light- and moderate-intensity activity—were strongest for people who reported having the most sedentary lifestyles. “Compared to someone who is just sitting around all the time, if you’re somebody who simply goes for a walk here and there at a comfortable pace, you’ll start to see some benefits,” says lead author Gregory Panza, a graduate student in UConn’s department of kinesiology. Vigorous activity, defined as exercising hard enough that carrying on a conversation becomes difficult, was not associated with wellbeing in either a positive nor a negative direction. “For regular exercisers who do like to do harder workouts, this can be reassuring that there aren’t negative consequences,” Panza says. Health.com: The Best Low-Impact Workouts for Weight Loss The study was unable to show a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and emotional health, and Panza acknowledges that it’s a complicated topic. “It can potentially be a vicious cycle,” he says. “People might have low levels of wellbeing because they’re not exercising, or they might not be exercising because they have low levels of wellbeing and they don’t have the drive to do it.” Underlying health conditions or injuries could also affect both mood and exercise habits. And, because the study participants were all in generally good health—physically and emotionally—the results may not hold true for everyone. For these reasons, the authors say, more research is needed to say for sure what type and duration of activities should be recommended for different groups of people. But this research does support the idea that any activity is better than no activity, says Panza, for both physical and mental health. “What’s nice about what we found is that it didn’t take a lot of effort to make a difference,” he says. “If we can somehow convince people to get off the couch and go for a little stroll, or go walk around a shopping center, they can potentially see a difference. It’s not necessary to push yourself to uncomfortable levels of exercise.” This article originally appeared on Health.com Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.06941753601589667, "subjectivity_score": 0.4918673312115935},
{"type": "article", "header": "Exercise Is Great. But Even Light Activities Like Walking and Housework Can Improve Your Health", "author": "Jamie Ducharme", "update_date/publish_date": "November 29, 2018 6:41 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5438387/exercise-guidelines-benefits/", "text": "For many, the phrase physical activity conjures sweaty runs or power-lifting sessions at the gym. But the latest federal guidelines support a much broader — and ultimately less intimidating — definition of what it means to be active: one that includes less obvious pursuits like taking the stairs, raking leaves and even bird-watching. This subtle shift in messaging may help Americans prevent chronic disease, improve their mental health and even live longer, experts say. The new federal physical-activity guidelines were updated in November for the first time since 2008, and they still urge adults to do 75 minutes of vigorous (or 150 minutes of moderate) aerobic activity each week, plus muscle-strengthening sessions like weight-lifting or yoga twice a week. But only 23% of Americans do so, and a recent study found that a quarter of American adults sit for more than eight hours per day. The addition of a simpler imperative to the guidelines—“move more and sit less,” no matter what form that movement takes or how long it lasts—may help more people to meet them. If more Americans follow that credo, they stand to gain significant health benefits. Recent research suggests that activities you’d never think of as exercise, like running errands and cleaning the bathroom, still have longevity perks. In a study of older women published last year in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, with each 30-minute chunk of light activities like these, people lowered their risk of dying early by 12% compared to their more sedentary peers. And a 2018 study found that among older men, each additional half hour of light physical activity, such as walking or gardening, slashed their risk of early death by 17%. Even things like standing on the subway or walking while you talk on the phone, rather than sitting down, can have an impact, says Jacque Crockford, a certified personal trainer with the American Council on Exercise. Studies show that these easy activities—known scientifically as non-exercise activity thermogenesis, or NEAT—are associated with lower body weight, better overall health and increased lifespan. “It’s important to recognize the difference between planned exercise and just being active,” Crockford says. “We put a lot of weight on the exercise part, rather than thinking of it as, ‘I’ll just move my body.’” That every movement counts may be the message Americans need to hear to get more active, says Jack Raglin, a professor of kinesiology at the Indiana University Bloomington School of Public Health. “The fitness industry tends to keep people focused on the standard modes of activity, but it can be a big hurdle to go to a gym or to join a class, especially if you are older, not fit or overweight,” Raglin says. “You want something that’s convenient and not too hard for most people, and that you can do any time or place.” Preaching exercise benefits that go beyond physical health may be another way to coax reluctant exercisers to move more, Raglin says. Exercise is associated with everything from better mental health to improved sleep quality and more creative thought, but those perks are often overshadowed by things like weight loss, muscular strength and conditioning, which may not appeal to some would-be exercisers. “When you exercise, let’s say your blood pressure goes down and your cholesterol goes down. Those are health benefits that don’t make you feel any different whatsoever, even though they’re very important,” Raglin says. “But when you exercise and you feel less stressed and more energetic and less fatigued, those are very profound.” Even better, research suggests that these benefits can also be achieved through light and moderate activity, as well as vigorous exercise. A study published earlier this year in the Lancet Psychiatry found that getting two to six hours of physical activity per week, including more leisurely forms such as walking and housework, measurably reduced the number of poor mental health days an individual reported each month. And plenty of research has shown that calming activities such as nature walking and “forest bathing” come with a slew of perks, ranging from lower stress levels to less depression and anxiety. At the very least, Crockford adds, helping people accept that even light physical activity can make a difference in their health might make gym-goers feel less guilty when they miss a planned workout — yet another mental health perk. Of course, there’s still a place for formal exercise, especially if you lead an otherwise sedentary lifestyle: It may help you reach your goals faster, and vigorous exercise often brings the biggest health benefits, at least for young, healthy people. But even if you don’t move enough to meet the federal recommendations, any progress towards them likely corresponds to better health, says Michael LaMonte, a research associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the University at Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions, and one of the authors of the recent study touting the benefits of cleaning and running errands. “Don’t put a time scale on it; don’t put an intensity on it,” LaMonte says. “We need to go back to the old days, when movement was a way of life.” Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/5450405/physical-activity-guidelines-2018/", "http://time.com/5324940/americans-exercise-physical-activity-guidelines/", "http://time.com/5459319/americans-sit-too-much/", "http://time.com/5030153/light-activity-longer-life/", "http://time.com/5166564/physical-exercise-can-increase-lifespan/", "http://time.com/5271079/resistance-training-depression/", "http://time.com/5360195/exercise-mental-health/", "http://time.com/4881665/green-spaces-nature-happiness/", "http://time.com/5259602/japanese-forest-bathing/", "http://time.com/2967417/exercise-sitting-down-nhanes/"], "sentiment_score": 0.10095347413529232, "subjectivity_score": 0.424466308102672},

But a large new study suggests that’s not always the case, at least when it comes to mental health. It’s well-established that exercise can improve mental health, and potentially even alleviate or prevent depression. But how much is enough to see a change? The new research, published Wednesday in the Lancet Psychiatry, says that just two hours of any form of exercise each week may make a significant impact. “One of the nice things is the accessibility of this,” says study co-author Adam Chekroud, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale University. “It seems like some of the benefits are pretty in reach for most people.” For the study, the researchers analyzed data provided by more than 1.2 million U.S. adults who responded to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey between 2011 and 2015. These individuals answered questions about their exercise regimens, lifestyle habits, health histories and the number of days per month they experienced poor mental health. On average, people reported 3.36 days of poor mental health per month. But those who said they exercised — through activities ranging from housework to running — experienced about 1.5 fewer gloomy days per month than sedentary peers, according to the research. When digging further into the numbers, the researchers noticed an interesting pattern: People who exercised for a moderate amount of time (about 45 minutes per session) saw better mental health results than those who favored marathon workouts. Similarly, sweating three to five times a week was associated with a bigger reduction in poor mental health days than either not exercising at all or hitting the gym more than five times a week, according to the research. Together, these results led the researchers to conclude that exercising for two to six hours a week may be the sweet spot for mental health. Federal physical activity guidelines, meanwhile, recommend 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity or 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week, plus twice-weekly strength training sessions, to reap the health benefits of exercise. Chekroud says the new study didn’t look at why six hours may be the upper limit on mental health gains (or whether exercise actually causes the patterns reflected in the data), but speculates that excessive exercise may be indicative of mental health issues. “Some people get obsessed with exercise, and some people run themselves into the ground. You can definitely see why someone who’s exercising a lot, or maybe obsessively, might have worse mental health,” he says. On the flip side, Chekroud says people who don’t exercise at all may miss out on the mood-boosting effects of fitness, which he says may actually change the way the brain functions. “There’s a lot of literature suggesting that people who are depressed and taking antidepressants who also exercise generally do better than people who just take antidepressants,” he says. “I think there’s for sure something going on neurobiologically in people who have depression that’s being helped by exercise.” Chekroud’s study provides some support for that hypothesis. Among individuals previously diagnosed with depression — who tend to have a higher-than-average number of poor mental health days — those who exercised had 3.75 fewer poor mental health days per month than those who didn’t. And while just about any form of physical activity is good for your body and brain, the researchers found that certain types of exercise were associated with slightly more mental health benefits than others. Team sports led the pack with a 22.3% reduction in mental health burden, followed by cycling (21.6%) and aerobic/gym exercises (20.1%). In a separate analysis, Chekroud and his colleagues also found that mindfulness exercises, such as yoga and tai chi, bestowed better mental health benefits than walking and many other types of exercise. These findings are in line with research that says social support and mindfulness may each improve mental health. Chekroud, who’s also a co-founder of the mental health startup Spring Health, says he hopes to use this data to develop a platform that could recommend customized mental-health-boosting exercise regimens, depending on a person’s demographic profile, symptoms and preferences. That service could be available within the next year, he says. But in the meantime, he says the study results should be encouraging for anyone looking to make a healthy lifestyle change. “A lot of people exercise for physical health benefits or weight loss,” Chekroud says, “but the concept of exercising for mental health benefits, explicitly, is pretty exciting.” Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4824531/strength-training-women-exercise/", "http://time.com/5285426/exercise-heart-health-aging/", "http://time.com/4779638/exercise-depression-mood/", "http://time.com/5271079/resistance-training-depression/", "http://time.com/4966319/exercise-depression-study/", "http://time.com/5324940/americans-exercise-physical-activity-guidelines/", "http://time.com/4696933/yoga-breathing-depression-2/", "http://time.com/5136409/health-benefits-love/", "http://time.com/3670202/daily-mindfulness/"], "sentiment_score": 0.10195353170036718, "subjectivity_score": 0.45199097667452104},

For Just 30 Minutes a Day, Do Anything Else But Sit", "author": "Jamie Ducharme", "update_date/publish_date": "January 15, 2019 11:14 AM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5502042/sitting-exercise-move/", "text": "You don’t need an expensive gym membership or marathon workouts to be healthy, a new study says: Just get up and move for at least half an hour a day. Plenty of research has found that too much sitting is linked to a range of health risks, from cardiovascular disease to early aging. But the new paper, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, finds that replacing just 30 minutes of sitting with any kind of movement, every day, could help you live longer. Getting up for half an hour of light activity — like walking, when a person would usually be sitting — corresponded to an estimated 17% lower risk of early death. Higher intensity movement has a larger effect; the same amount of moderate or vigorous exercise corresponded to about a 35% lower mortality risk, the paper says. “There used to be this whole notion of no pain, no gain — that exercise or activity has to hurt to reap benefits,” says study co-author Keith Diaz, an assistant professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. But the latest research suggests that “exercise doesn’t have to be done for hours at a time. It’s something that anyone can do. It just requires walking, even for short periods of time.” Of course, more exercise is still better. Diaz and his colleagues found that longevity benefits compounded as physical activity piled up; an hour of exercise conferred twice as many benefits as half an hour. But there appeared to be a point — around 3.5 hours of movement per day — at which people maxed out their gains from exercise. “If you move enough, there’s a threshold at which you’ve tipped the scale, and our risks from sitting are eliminated,” Diaz says. The study used data from almost 8,000 healthy Americans who were older than 45 and who had worn physical activity trackers for at least four days as part of a separate study. The researchers used this data to calculate how much time people spent being sedentary versus active, and tracked people’s health and mortality data over more than five years of follow-up. They then created simulations that approximated how adding more movement — and thereby cutting down on sedentary time — could affect mortality risk. The researchers found that even modest increases in physical activity contributed to a lower risk of death. And, they found, these chunks of movement were just as impactful if they accumulated little by little, rather than during one longer session. “We used to think that exercise had to be done at a moderate or vigorous intensity. We used to think it had to be done in 10 minutes or more at a time,” Diaz says. “Our results kind of shift the narrative a bit. A one-minute burst here and a one-minute burst there actually can still be healthful.” One important limitation of the study, however, is that it was based on simulations and was not a trial in which people changed their behavior and researchers observed the effects; that kind of experiment is the next step, Diaz says. But the researchers did go beyond many prior studies by accounting for every part of people’s days, and modeling how changing the proportion of sedentary versus active time could affect health. Diaz’s research joins many other recent studies in finding that small bouts of exercise make a difference. When the federal physical activity guidelines were updated last year, they also said that short bursts of movement could count toward the recommended 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week. Research suggests that many Americans aren’t even getting close to that point. A recent study found that a quarter of American adults sit for more than eight hours a day, and only 3% said they sat for less than four hours a day and exercised regularly. Only 23% of adults meet federal physical activity guidelines, according to the latest numbers. For the average American adult, the message behind Diaz’ study is an important one. “Just getting up and moving a little bit, even at light intensity, could be enough to lower your risk,” he says.

Still, consumer-privacy advocates are increasingly raising concerns about the fate of personal health information, which is potentially valuable to companies that collect and sell it, gathered through a growing number of internet-connected devices. “We don’t know what happens to all that data,” says Burcu Kilic, director of the digital rights program at Public Citizen, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C. The information “is also relevant and important to pharmaceutical companies and those that make hospital-related technology,” Kilic says. Nonetheless, consumers are flocking to mattresses, sleep tracking devices and under-mattress sensors that claim to quantify sleep. Sleep apps are among the most popular downloads on Apple and Android smartphones. Sleep number is one of the most heavily marketed of such products, with press releases and ads often equating good sleep with better a better life. Sales of the beds grew 6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion in 2018, company filings show. Early this year, it signed a partnership with Ariana Huffington’s Thrive Global (a corporate wellness firm she launched after leaving the Huffington Post in 2016). Last year, Sleep Number began a multi-year partnership with the NFL, in which the company gives its beds to players. The company says it goes to great lengths to protect its customers’ data. “To be clear, Sleep Number does not share any SleepIQ or biometric” data outside the company, said Sleep Number spokeswoman Julie Elepano in email exchanges. However, that differs from the company’s privacy notice, which clearly states that personal information—potentially including biometric data—“may” be shared with marketing companies or business partners. They, in turn, could send out pitches for Sleep Number or offers to participate in partner product loyalty programs. The policy also says personal information could be given to partners for “research, analysis or administering surveys.” Finally, the privacy policy says Sleep Number can “exploit, share and use for any purpose” personal information with names or addresses withheld or stripped out, known as “de-identified” data. When asked about the seeming difference between what the privacy policy states and her comments, Elepano did not address that directly, but reiterated that the company does not share even de-identified biometric data. From when you turn in to when you wake up, these beds know a lot, thanks to a range of potential sensors. Some, for example, use microphones to track snoring; typically, these devices and apps are marketed for that purpose. Late last year, there was a collective social media freakout when bloggers noticed a quirk in the Sleep Number bed privacy policy that seemed to indicate those beds had a microphone. But they don’t, the company was quick to note. Instead, Sleep Number beds gather data through tiny changes in the mattress’s air pressure—the beds have sensors that can inflate, deflate or otherwise adjust the mattress for comfort—says Pete Bils, Sleep Number’s vice president of sleep science and research. Those data, along with goals each consumer sets for sleep, go into creating what the firm calls a Sleep IQ Score, designed to assess how well a consumer slept (and used heavily in the company’s marketing). Over time, the score purports to show if a person is deviating from their averages. If consumers don’t want to track what’s going on in bed, they can flip on a “privacy mode” setting, which halts transmission, but also limits what a consumer can learn about their sleep patterns—presumably one reason they bought the bed in the first place. “The more you use the bed, the more it knows you,” says Bils. From what is spelled out in privacy policies for these bed and apps, it’s clear the data could be useful in other ways, too. For example, the French company Withings, which makes an under-mattress monitor that can track movement, heart rate, snoring and other factors, says it shares anonymous and aggregated data “with partners such as hospitals, researchers or companies, as well as to the public in blog posts and data studies.” According to the Sleep Number privacy policy, it collects personal information, which can include names and information about a consumer’s age, weight, height and gender. If a consumer creates a user profile on the bed’s app, that personal information is expanded to include specifics about movement, positions, respiration and heart rate. That is also true for children if parents create a user profile for them. The policy also notes that personal data might be stored indefinitely, even “after you cancel or deactivate” user accounts. The privacy policies of many devices that track and transmit personal information allow for the sharing of data that has been stripped of personal identifiers. But privacy experts have shown it’s not terribly difficult to use or combine such information to “re-identify” people. “You are left with the impression that, ‘Don’t worry, no one will be able to point to you,’ but they don’t actually say that,” says Lee Tien, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “I don’t know how they actually could say that.” Unlike personal data collected in a doctor’s office or a sleep clinic, the information gathered by sleep trackers is not protected by federal privacy rules. Some sleep trackers or apps can connect with other “smart” devices in your home, such as a thermostat or coffee maker. Nifty, for sure, because as you wake up, your heater can kick on and the coffee maker can start doing its thing. But it also can mean those devices are sharing your information. Sleep Number says its beds can import information from other devices but does not share customer information with them. Still, the interconnectedness exposes more vulnerabilities. “We connect all these devices to each other,” notes Kilic at Public Citizen. “If hackers want to get into the system, [they] can easily do so and collect all this info from you: How do you use your bed? How often do you have sex? This is very sensitive information.” Privacy experts recommend encryption and the use of strong passwords and additional authentication whenever possible. Some trackers and sensors allow for such protections; Sleep Number’s Bils says the data transmitted is encrypted. The goal of the data gathering, Sleep Number and other companies say, is helping sleep-deprived Americans do a better job at, well, sleeping. But do consumers really need an app—or a bed that can costs thousands of dollars—to tell them how rested they feel in the morning? Such tools are “great because it makes people more aware of sleep, but it’s a slippery slope,” says Dr. Seema Khosla, a pulmonologist and medical director of the North Dakota Center for Sleep, a sleep study facility in Fargo. Khosla, who uses a few trackers herself, is also the lead author of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine’s position paper on sleep apps. One unexpected consequence: people who become too attuned to their data may experience anxiety—and an inability to sleep. “We call it orthosomnia,” she says. “They get all this data and get upset about having a perfect number. We tell them to put it away for a couple of weeks.” Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Marco Rubio of Florida.”You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing, protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.” McCabe made his public debut as acting director on Thursday, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee in a seat initially set to be occupied by the ousted Comey. Both senators and the witnesses from the intelligence community largely tip-toed around the elephant in the room throughout the hearing: Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats delivered a lengthy opening statement for the whole group, Chair Richard Burr steered questions away from the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and toward broader national security threats. But Burr did ask McCabe about interactions the President had with Director Comey in reference to the ongoing investigation into his campaign’s possible ties to Russia. A line in the President’s letter of dismissal to Comey suggests that the president was informed on “three separate occasions” that he was not directly under FBI investigation. That line has raised questions about how much the Russia investigation influenced Trump’s decision to let Comey go. “I cannot comment on any conversations that the Director may have had with the president,” McCabe said. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top ranking Democrat on the committee, also asked McCabe to commit to notifying them if there is any future attempt to interfere with the investigation into Russian meddling. “I absolutely do,” he said.

It can lower a person’s risk for Alzheimer’s disease and may even slow brain aging by about 10 years. Now, new research helps illuminate how, exactly, working out improves brain health. In one research review published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers examined 39 studies that looked at the link between exercise and cognitive abilities among people over age 50. They found that aerobic exercise appears to improve a person’s cognitive function and resistance training can enhance a person’s executive function and memory. Other exercises like tai chi were also linked to improvements in cognition, though there wasn’t as much available evidence. Ultimately, the researchers concluded that 45 minutes to an hour of moderate-to-vigorous exercise was good for the brain. “There is now a wide body of research showing that the benefits to the body with exercise also exist for the brain,” says study author Joe Northey, a PhD candidate at the University of Canberra Research Institute for Sport and Exercise in Australia. “When older adults undertake aerobic or resistance exercise, we see changes to the structure and function of areas of the brain responsible for complex mental tasks and memory function.” But how does exercise have these effects? Another new study presented at the American Physiological Society’s annual meeting in Chicago explored one possible way. In the study, researchers from New Mexico Highlands University found that when people walk, the pressure of making impact with the ground sends waves through the arteries, which increase blood flow to the brain (also called cerebral blood flow). Getting enough blood to the brain is important for healthy brain function, since blood flow brings the brain oxygen and nutrients. In the small study—which has not yet been published—researchers used ultrasounds to assess arteries and changes in cerebral blood flow in 12 healthy young adults while they were standing, walking and running. The increases in blood flow were greater when the men and women ran, but walking was enough to spur the effect. “[Increased cerebral blood flow] gives the brain more to work with,” says study author Ernest R. Greene, a professor of engineering and biology at New Mexico Highlands University. “It’s another positive aspect of exercise.” Scientists are still exploring multiple ways by which fitness improves the brain. But blood flow is a promising path, since it can also help create new brain cells. The protein BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) also seems to play a role because it helps repair and protect brain cells from degeneration. Exercise can also boost mood by triggering the release of feel-good hormones and chemicals, like endorphins, which can improve brain health. A 2015 study found that exercise may be able to prevent the onset of depressive symptoms. “Each type of exercise seems to have different effects on the growth factors responsible for the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain,” says Northey. “That may indicate why doing both aerobic and resistance training is of benefit to cognitive function.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4474874/exercise-fitness-workouts/", "http://time.com/2982908/to-prevent-alzheimers-diet-and-exercise-are-effective-large-study-shows/?iid=sr-link1", "http://time.com/4269672/exercise-brain-aging/", "http://time.com/4696746/zumba-workout-dance-aerobics/?iid=sr-link5", "http://time.com/4618826/strength-training-fitness-workout/?iid=sr-link1", "http://time.com/4624276/yoga-workplace-mindfulness/?iid=sr-link2", "http://time.com/4474874/exercise-fitness-workouts/", "http://time.com/4352177/exercise-benefits-brain-and-mood/", "http://time.com/3713268/exercise-depression/"], "sentiment_score": 0.15797558922558927, "subjectivity_score": 0.4682239057239057},

Now, a small new study from Boston University finds that taking yoga classes twice a week may help ease depression, thanks in part to deep breathing. The study, which was published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, included 30 people from ages 18 to 64 with clinical depression, who either were not taking antidepressants or had been on a steady dose for at least three months. Half of the participants were assigned to take a 90-minute Iyengar yoga class three times per week, as well as four 30-minute sessions at home each week. People in the other group took two group classes and three at-home sessions every week. Iyengar yoga classes emphasize alignment, precise postures and controlled breathing. The classes taught in the study also included 20 minutes of slow, gentle breathing, at a rate of five inhales exhales through the nose per minute. After about three months, most of the people in both groups had lowered their scores on a depression-screening questionnaire by at least 50%. Not surprisingly, more yoga was better; those who took three classes per week had lower depression scores than those who took two per week. But since many participants mentioned that the larger time commitment was challenging, the researchers actually recommend two classes per week, saying that the regimen still comes with meaningful benefits. That yoga seems to be effective is good news for people struggling with depression. Lead author Dr. Chris Streeter, associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at Boston University School of Medicine, says that the practice has far fewer side effects and potential drug interactions than mood-altering medications. The most common complaint reported in the study was a small one—temporary muscle soreness—and one participant experienced distressing thoughts while practicing breathing exercises at home. Some people who haven’t responded to traditional treatments might do well with yoga, because unlike antidepressant drugs, yoga and deep breathing target the autonomic nervous system, Streeter says. “If your autonomic nervous system is balanced out, then the rest of the brain works better,” she says. Research shows that 40% of people on antidepressants do not recover fully from depression, says Streeter, which puts them at increased risk for a relapse. “Getting that 40% all the way better is a really important goal. Instead of adding another drug, I would argue that yoga is another thing you can add to the treatment regimen that might help.” More research is needed to determine how yoga stacks up against other treatments. (A larger trial comparing yoga to walking is underway, the study notes.) While Iyengar yoga is generally considered to be a safe practice for people of all levels, it’s not the only type with health benefits, Streeter adds. “It depends on who the person is and what they’re looking for,” she says. For now, what’s clear is that the type with the most health benefits will be whichever kind you stick with.

The paper, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, found that resistance exercise training (RET), such as weightlifting and strength training, is associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. It also, of course, comes with physical benefits, like making bones stronger and preventing chronic conditions. Brett Gordon, the paper’s first author and a postgraduate researcher in the department of physical education and sports sciences at Ireland’s University of Limerick, stops short of calling resistance training a cure for depression, but he says the findings are compelling, especially since it’s accessible, affordable and possible to do at home. And it seems to work as well as the frontline treatments for depression—antidepressants and behavioral therapies—Gordon says in an email to TIME. Because the study was based on past research, however, it wasn’t possible to tell from this paper exactly why that might be the case, or to prove a definitive cause-and-effect relationship. But other research suggests that by increasing blood flow to the brain, exercise can change the structure and function of the brain, create new brain cells and trigger the release of mood-enhancing chemicals like endorphins. Gordon and his colleagues analyzed 33 clinical trials—including nearly 2,000 people in total—that examined the effects of resistance exercise training on symptoms of depression. Across the board, they found that strength training was associated with improvements in depressive symptoms such as low mood, a loss of interest in activities and feelings of worthlessness, regardless of a person’s age, sex, health status, specific exercise routine or improvements in physical strength. “Interestingly, larger improvements were found among adults with depressive symptoms indicative of mild-to-moderate depression compared to adults without such scores, suggesting RET may be particularly effective for those with greater depressive symptoms,” Gordon says. Since the researchers saw improvements associated with a wide range of strength-training programs, Gordon says he can’t name a single best exercise regimen for your mental health. (There was, however, some evidence to support the effects of supervised routines shorter than 45 minutes.) He recommends following the guidelines provided by the American College of Sports Medicine: doing strength training at least two days per week by performing eight to 12 repetitions of eight to 10 different strength-building exercises each time. While the current review specifically examined resistance training, plenty of evidence suggests that other forms of physical activity, such as aerobic exercise, cardio and yoga, may also improve depressive symptoms. A secondary analysis included in the JAMA paper also found no significant difference in the effects of RET versus aerobic exercise for alleviating depressive symptoms, Gordon says. Of course, the factors that dictate mental health are complicated. Lifting weights may not be enough to wipe out depressive symptoms entirely, and it can be difficult to find the energy or motivation to start a new exercise regimen if you’re already struggling with depression. Nonetheless, Gordan says the new review adds weight to the argument that resistance training can be a powerful tool for improving mental health.

The paper, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, followed more than 22,000 healthy Norwegian adults without symptoms of anxiety or depression for an average of 11 years, asking them about their exercise habits and symptoms of depression and anxiety at the beginning and end of the study. At the start, about 12% said they didn’t exercise, and the rest said they exercised anywhere from “up to 30 minutes” to “more than 4 hours” a week. Over the next decade, about 7% of people in the study developed depression, and about 9% developed anxiety. No relationship was observed between exercise and later anxiety, but the researchers did find a link between exercise and later depression. People who said they didn’t exercise at the study’s start were 44% more likely to become depressed, compared to those who exercised at least 1 to 2 hours a week. For people who worked out more, no additional benefits were observed. The study could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and the risk of depression, but the authors say it strongly suggests one—especially because they controlled for other potential factors, including age, gender, social support, smoking, drinking and body mass index. If their hypothesis is right, they say, 12% of depression cases could be prevented if everyone got just one hour of exercise a week. That exercise doesn’t have to be intense, either, they say. People seemed to have mental health benefits from physical activity regardless of whether they reported working out to the point of exhaustion or barely breaking a sweat. MORE: 7 Surprising Benefits of Exercise “Given that the intensity of exercise does not appear to be important,” the authors wrote in their paper, “it may be that the most effective public health measures are those that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday activities, such as walking or cycling.” Of course, there are other benefits to more frequent and more intense bouts of exercise. Both the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization recommend getting at least 150 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity physical activity a week for cardiovascular and overall health. But when it comes to mental health benefits, “the majority of the protective effect comes from the first one or two hours of exercise each week,” said study author Samuel Harvey, associate professor of workplace mental health at the Black Dog Institute and the University of New South Wales, in an email. MORE: A New Hope For Depression The authors write that the combined physical and social benefits of exercise are likely responsible for its ability to help stave off depression. It’s also possible, they add, that exercise may trigger changes in self-esteem, the release of mood-boosting endorphins and the production of certain proteins. “There is good evidence that physical activity can help people recover from depression, though we recommend it be used in addition to the usual treatments we would prescribe for established depression, like medication and counseling,” says Harvey. “Our study takes this a bit further and shows that exercise may also have a role in preventing people developing depression in the first place.”  Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/collection/guide-to-exercise/", "http://time.com/magazine/us/4547305/november-7th-2016-vol-188-no-19-u-s/", "http://time.com/4474874/exercise-fitness-workouts/", "http://time.com/4876098/new-hope-for-depression/"], "sentiment_score": 0.1321630483943917, "subjectivity_score": 0.40488752540991335},

Deep down, I knew that my femininity or worth as a person was not tied to my ability to carry a baby. However, there was something about being unable to do something that comes so naturally, even effortlessly, to some that made me feel like less of a human. I also struggled with feelings of jealousy. Any time a friend or family member would announce their pregnancy, it was like a kick to the stomach. I was happy for them and didn’t begrudge them any of the joy they were experiencing. But at the same time, I was so devastated for myself. It sometimes took everything in me to put a smile on my face and then count down the minutes until I could excuse myself to go home and cry. I hated feeling this way. I’d never considered myself a bitter person, and it killed me that my knee-jerk reaction to someone else’s good news was to burst into tears. Infertility used to be such a consuming part of my life. I would monitor my temperature first thing in the morning and, for some stretches, go to the doctor almost daily. I spent so much time sitting on that stupid piece of butcher paper on the exam table, taking drugs and doing tests. So much time attending other people’s baby showers, seeing their pregnancy announcements, going through the frenzied hope and desire at the beginning of the month, only to experience acute heartache and despair. Infertility is not the all-encompassing presence in my life that it used to be. But sometimes, usually pretty rarely, it’s still hard. Even now, as a mother to two spectacular little boys, there are still things about myself and my path to parenthood that make me feel like I don’t fit in. Infertility can be isolating and lonely. However, after more than seven years of infertility, I can say that, while I will never love the heartache associated with it, I have developed an appreciation for how infertility has shaped my character and my story. Read more: 11 Traits Parents of Successful Kids Have in Common Infertility led me to adoption, and adoption led me to my boys. You may point out that, if it weren’t for infertility, then I probably would have had kids anyway. But the thing is, they wouldn’t have been my Mason and my Kellen. Those mischievous, curly-haired, curious, sweet, fire-engine-loving little boys. I can’t think about life without infertility because that would mean life without them. For years, I have tried to think of the perfect way to explain how certain I am that our children were meant to be ours. It’s one of the very few things I feel and know with more certainty than anything else. I love those boys so deeply, so abundantly. I wouldn’t change a single thing about them, most especially the way they came to me. You see, waiting for them for so long and wanting them so much is part of what makes them so precious to me.  If I picked up anything during my struggle with infertility—my one souvenir—I hope it’s a greater sense of compassion. It’s like that phrase, “Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.” Infertility is kind of an invisible loss. It’s hard to describe the pain that comes from missing someone you have never met. It’s a deeply personal grief that many people will never know you carry. Having carried that grief myself, I try to be a little more sensitive to the sorrows of others. My execution is probably often clumsy and imperfect, but my capacity for empathy has grown through my own pain.

TIME LightBox selects 50 Instagram accounts to follow – one from each and every state. By Olivier Laurent & Lucia De Stefani   @jaredragland A former photo editor for the White House, Jared Ragland is also a photographer and professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. For him, Instagram is a “creative outlet” that he uses to “experiment, play and engage in a dynamic dialogue with other photographers.” His feed is a mix of black-and-white street scenes (realized with the app’s Inkwell filter) and the eerie collages that are one of his passions.  @arni_coraldo Corey Arnold might reside in Portland, Ore., but he spends the majority of his time in Bristol Bay, Alaska, where he runs a wild sockeye salmon fishing operation in “an abandoned cannery complex called Graveyard Point,” he says. It so happens that Arnold is also a professional photographer whose work has been published in magazines worldwide and in two now hard-to-find books. His photographs of fishermen at work offer a quiet and intimate look at the trade – one that cannot be missed.  @ryannealcordwell Ryan Neal Cordwell is one part of the duo behind the creative design firm Royal & Design in Arizona, and his Instagram feed shows where the creative director gets his inspiration and love for simple, yet carefully composed photographs.  @ninarobinsonnyc Nina Robinson lives in the Bronx, but in 2014 when she returned to Dalark, Ark., to say goodbye to her grandmother, she stayed to create a body of work that explores life and loss. “My family has a storied history in the South, going back six generations in Arkansas,” she says. “I became fascinated with exploring these often overlooked communities experiencing varying states of decline.” Now, she’s taking this work further, looking at the Center Point African Methodist Episcopal Church, a community epicenter in rural Arkansas that was built, in part, by her great-grandfather in 1944. Her aim is “to document rarely seen moments illustrating faith, poverty, education and race within this rural African American community.”  @mattblack_blackmatt For more than 20 years, Matt Black has been photographing extreme poverty in California’s Central Valley where issues of immigration, climate change and economic hardship are intertwined. His powerful, black-and-white images bring the reality of poverty into people’s pockets, offering a stark reminder of our country’s fragile social fabric. Now, he’s taken his work across the country using Instagram as his publishing platform.  @mattslaby The Denver-based photographer used to be a wildland firefighter for the U.S. Forest Service Hotshots. Now, his photographic work focuses on Western America “to explore the vastness and beauty of its space with the people and stories that occupy it,” he says. For him, Instagram is a test kitchen – a place to get quick feedback and experiment. “I have found, on Instagram, an audience to help me think through some visual challenges,” he explains.  @neivy A self-described photographer and poet, Janeivy Hilario looks at Instagram as a way to “interlay my vision of making connections with what my hometown and Connecticut has to offer,” he says. “From partnering with brands and local businesses to hosting Insta-meets to bring a community together.” His feed offers a stimulating view of Connecticut through a mix of landscape images and striking portraits.  @bythebrush Known predominantly for her painting work, Laura E. Pritchett is also a photographer who shares her inspiring images on her Instagram feed. With more than 200,000 followers, she has quickly been noticed for her work and is now represented by the Tinker Street agency.  @MrAntooine MrAntooine’s artistic approach is full of humor. The photographer from Florida plays with the idea of the absurd, the self and time in multiple forms: a man with an iPad-face holds a human head-device while another, lifting his t-shirt, sports a six-pack of beers. In his signature pictures, shadows rarely reflect the original shapes, and an invisible man often comes into play while MrAntooine’s piercing captions add a hint of wit to each square.  @timlampe Landscape images used to dominate Tim Lampe’s Instagram feed but, in recent months, he’s taken a new approach based, in large part, on his experience as a designer. “[I’m] sharing images that build up this alternate reality that’s not so different from our existing one,” he says. “I found more satisfaction in creating images that resonated with people and made them feel something.” And the response was overwhelming, he explains. “There’s so much noise in social media that I want to be deliberate in what I share and offer it as an opportunity to put a positive attitude in someone’s day.”  @meltjoeng No one will disagree with Melanie Tjoeng when she says that Hawaii is a paradise for photographers. “It’s very easy to capture beautiful images here; not only is the landscape majestic, but also the people and culture are equally beautiful,” she says. And Instagram is the best place to showcase that beauty as well as her photography skills. “It gives not only an insight into my life but a representation of my work; it’s incredible to be able to share those things with so many people.” Her feed is a mixture of daily life, travel and work photographs. “All in all, it’s a representation of how I see and feel about the world around me,” she says.  @camrindengel Camrin Dengel grew up in Alaska, but she now calls Idaho her home, sharing on Instagram carefully crafted photographs of rural life. “The story I’ve chosen to tell with my photographs is one that is close to the earth, full of raw and organic beauty,” she says. “I’ve been diving deep into the theme of ‘returning to our roots’; nourishing a relationship with our food and forging a connection with the natural world.”  @joshualott As a photojournalist, Joshua Lott maintains a feed that captures people and places he encounters around the country and in his own community. “Instagram is a great platform and opportunity to showcase my images around the world,” he says. The photographer spent nine months in Iowa in 2008 to cover the presidential election, and now he’s back in the neighboring state for the 2016 elections.  @skylerwagoner Only 17, Skyler Wagoner already shows great promise. His photographs of Indiana’s countryside, mixed with portraits of his friends, have a certain nostalgic Stand By Me feel to them.  @reallykindofamazing A native of Iowa, Garrett Cornelison has quickly established his name on Instagram with more than 140,000 followers, receiving commissions from commercial clients such as Lincoln, Hollister and Aeropostale. His particular style of photography has even become a filter in the Priime photo app. Now, after a 50-state documentary journey, he’s settling in Los Angeles — but, he says, Iowa remains his “forever home.”  @belebenard Béle Benard is an artist, designer and photographer originally from Wichita, Kans. “I approach Instagram like I approached painting and drawing growing up – trial and error,” she says. A novice photographer – she started taking pictures a year ago – Benard uses photography as a “therapeutic creative outlet” beyond school activities. “It’s all about being open to new modes of creating. You can’t be afraid of messing up, because it’s going to happen. What’s important is how you deal with it; you can’t dwell. You can only try again.”  @howdyluke A photojournalist who’s been chasing the news around the country – from the White House to Ferguson – Luke Sharrett turns to Instagram to escape the pressure of the job. “It’s a place where I can be myself,” he says. “I’ve been on a railroad kick for the past 26 years, which means I post my fair share of train pictures.” Not that there’s anything wrong with that.  @nolabeings “It’s easy to associate New Orleans with a couple of buzzwords: Mardi Gras, Bourbon Street, Hurricane Katrina,” says Claire Bangser. “But below the surface, the city is culturally rich, diverse, complex and wholly undefinable. It’s like nowhere else in America.” That’s why the young photographer decided to start NOLAbeings to present her city’s diverse population and history. “Every day I approach strangers on the street and ask to take their portrait. It’s a jumping off point to ask about their lives,” she says. “My hope for the project is that – in some small way – it inspires more people to talk to strangers, to listen deeply and to start meaningful dialogues within the community.”  @aabbyylou Abigail Johnson-Ruscansky, a 21-year-old photographer living in Maine, loves Instagram because of its community. “It helps me make friends from all over the world, meet in real life and shoot together, all while sharing creative ideas and inspiring one another,” she says. Her carefully composed photographs, which draw from her interest in fine art, showcase everyday moments. “Whether I am trying out a new coffee shop, excited about the place I am exploring or showing appreciation for who I am with, I love to document and share moments of my day through images [that] communicate with my followers,” she says.  @bydvnlln For Devin Allen, a West Baltimore-born and raised photographer, this photo changed his life. When Freddie Gray died in police custody, Allen took his camera and started covering the protests, uploading his best photos on his Instagram feed. One of them, shown here, made the cover of TIME magazine, propelling the young photographer to the national stage. Since then, his photographs have been exhibited in museums in Baltimore (and at Photoville in New York City in September) and are now part of the Smithsonian’s permanent collection. Allen continues to photograph his city, but he also teaches his craft to Baltimore’s youth.  @johnstanmeyer A founding member of the VII Photo agency and a National Geographic photographer, John Stanmeyer has worked in nearly 100 countries. As a result, his feed is an invitation to travel the world and discover new cultures. When he’s in Massachusetts, where he owns the Stanmeyer Gallery & Shaker Dam Coffeehouse in West Stockbridge, he shares his love of the Berkshires and, of course, coffee.  @patricialaydorsey It was at a family picnic in August 2013 that 73-year-old Patricia Lay-Dorsey discovered Instagram. Since that day, she’s been using the app to create a community and to share blurry black-and-white images of her daily life with her husband. The images now form a body of work she calls Tea for Two. Why blurry? Because she wanted to move away from sharp focus, concentrating on people’s vibrational energy, she says. “With Instagram, I’m free to play, to color outside the lines, to explore new avenues and simply see what happens,” she adds. “As an artist I know that is where creativity flourishes.”  @wideeyedlegless Based in the St. Paul/Minneapolis area, Madelynn Furlong is an art director, fashion blogger and creative consultant. Furlong has collaborated with several American apparel brands and now works as the art director of Target in the Minneapolis area. Out of her intimate desire to create and share a “simpler, more thoughtful wardrobe, home and lifestyle,” in 2010 Furlong founded Wide Eyed Legless, a fashion blog where she shares her minimalistic-chic approach to style and beauty. Her signature style is mirrored by her Instagram feed’s.  @misvincent Melissa Vincent’s interest in mobile photography was sparked when she joined Instagram in April 2011. Her photographs quickly caught public attention as she gained many followers and after one of her snapshots was featured on the cover of TIME magazine’s first annual Wireless Issue in 2012. Her Instagram feed depicts fairy tale-like, dreamy landscapes where the line between photography and visual art smoothly intersects. Her goal, she says, is to show a “different side of Mississippi.”  @nothing_to_worry_about Melissa Spitz has spent the last six years documenting her mentally ill mother. When she started sharing her photographs on Instagram, she was attracted to the app’s grid view, which, she says, is “like a window that gives viewers an opportunity to physically dissect images while simultaneously realizing that this was very metaphorical to understanding mental illness.” In essence, she adds, “my Instagram has become another cathartic facet of the story involving my mother.”  @amivitale A National Geographic photographer, Ami Vitale uses Instagram to showcase images that speak of the connections that exist between people, communities and nature. “I use photography to focus on the commonalities rather then the things that divide,” she says. That link can be found in her home state of Montana, or 5,000 miles away in China or Kenya if she’s on assignment.  @brettbrooner Omaha-based self-taught photographer Brett Brooner admits without any fuss his Instagram addiction, a smartphone-related mania that has gotten him more than 60,000 followers. Mostly shot in color, wedding pictures and laid-back portrait shots fill his Instagram gallery, along with captivating images of the Nebraska landscape. As he frequently scouts for shooting locations with fellow photographers, Brooner often appears in his own images.  @johnnylace Johnny Lace is only 23 but he’s already deeply embedded in the Instagram community. His carefully composed photographs of Las Vegas and other areas in the state, as well as his youthful portraits, are a delight. “I feel that Instagram has changed the way we see things,” says the photographer, who has a particular love for street scenes. “You never know what you’ll capture when you’re out there.”  @cherylestonge Cheryle St. Onge, a photographer, artist and educator who received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2009, is an enthusiastic adopter of the 8×10 format, which she uses to photograph her surroundings in New Hampshire and Maine. But she has also eagerly embraced Instagram since 2011. “Instagram allows me to share and experiment with my work in a much more instantaneous way and gain feedback almost immediately,” she says.  @_spirits Boasting a decadent aesthetic, Tilly García, based out of Asbury Park, N.J., floods her feed with natural shots of velvety flowers, handmade gothic ornaments, and the romantic and supernatural allure of faded and mysterious books. Some of her photographs turn into prints available in García’s Etsy shop.  @stellamariabaer While Stella Maria Baer lives in New Haven, Conn., her work as a painter and photographer takes her back to her native New Mexico. Her inspiring Instagram feed shows photographs from the deserts and valleys that rule her dreams, alongside examples of her paintings of planets and moons.  @thomas_prior Thomas Prior first got into photography at age 13 when he won a drawing contest and used the cash prize to buy himself a camera. A graduate from the School of Visual Arts in New York, Thomas has quickly differentiated himself from his peers with his simple yet raw aesthetic, especially when he’s photographing athletes. His Instagram feed is a sketchbook, he says. “I used to shoot with a small camera and post pictures to my blog. I treated the process like eyeball training and that approach bled over to using a phone instead and posting to Instagram.” The feed is a must-see, especially for those in need of inspiration.  @jtully John Tully is an independent photographer based in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. With a bachelor’s degree from the University of Missouri School of Journalism obtained in 2008, Tully has worked as a newspaper staff photographer and has turned to his phone’s camera and his Instagram feed to create a photographic diary that offers “a visual glimpse of real moments in everyday life,” he says.  @bengum The sky in North Dakota can be mesmerizing, and Ben Gumeringer captures its massive, fluffy clouds and stark horizon line in a series of beautiful photographs. “Growing up I was never good at expressing myself artistically,” he says. “I couldn’t draw or paint to save my life, but as soon as I picked up a camera, I could express myself. My camera has taken me to places I could have never imagined.” Based in Bismarck, Gumeringer is now a freelance photojournalist after having interned at Fargo’s Spotlight Media, the publisher of four local magazines.  @robertwtobin Based in Columbus, Ohio, 44-year-old Robert W. Tobin worked as an interior designer for almost two decades, before pursuing a degree in Early Childhood Education from Otterbein University, following his greater passion to become a teacher. Still, the aesthetic approach nurtured during his designer career emerges in his visual chronicle from Columbus: portraits, objects, shapes and views of the urban landscape compose his snippets, creating what Tobin calls #StoryInASquare.  @burkhartsokc Originally from Choctaw, Jonathan Burkhart is now a portrait and wedding photographer based in Oklahoma City. His curiosity and love of the outdoors bring him to adventurous explorations, camping or hiking with friends, moments that he often captures with his phone. His Instagram feed, a gallery of portraits and natural landscape shots, is boosted with VSCO cam-processed photos but also reveals his occasional use of traditional film.  @waywardspark Camille Storch spends most of her time in farms and gardens in rural Oregon where she and her husband, a beekeeper, live. Her feed is a feast for the eyes with pictures of food, farms, forests and, of course, bees. “I worked on farms for years and still spend a lot of time in my parents’ garden, so I’m a big fan of and advocate for fresh produce,” she says.  @charlesmostoller A freelance photojournalist based in Philadelphia, Charles Mostoller shares on his Instagram feed images he shoots “on the periphery of assignments,” he says. “I generally use my Instagram account as a place to publish the photos that don’t have a home in the paper or on the wire. I like looking for small/side moments while on assignment, and often these are my favorite photos.” For Mostoller, Instagram acts as a journal but also a business card. “Many photographers and photo editors follow me and vice versa, and by keeping a relatively steady stream of high quality photos on there I give editors a chance to see what I’ve been working on.”  @jesse_burke For Jesse Burke, a professional photographer from Rhode Island, nature holds an important place in his work as well as in his relationship with his three daughters. “[We] often embark on road trips to explore the natural world,” Burke writes on his website, explaining how their travels often inspire reflections on the “vastness of nature” as they get in touch with the earth – something particularly important at a time when technology can monopolize children’s attentions. In Burke’s work the desire to reconnect with the natural elements is powerful. “I want [them] to truly understand how wild and precious nature is and how we, as humans, are an integral part of the system.”  @KendrickBrinson One part of the photographic duo Brinson+Banks, Brinson wears many hats. “I create lifestyle ad photography alongside my husband for major brands, I do portraiture and documentary work for national magazines and newspapers, and I work on personal photo projects when I’m really excited or intrigued about something.” In addition, as her colorful Instagram feed clearly shows, she documents her daily life and many travels across the country. “Just recently I dug deep into my Instagram stream looking for an old photo and was reminded of joyful moments I’d completely forgotten,” she says. “Photography is really wonderful like that.”  @thesdcowgirl The Instagram feed of Jenn Zeller, a proud South Dakota cowgirl, doesn’t lack for delightful insights into what an authentic cattle ranch life feels like: scenes of cows and yearlings led to fresh pasture and of indoor horse training share space with snapshots of rustic local food, ranch critters and floral surroundings.  @thiswildidea With close to 1 million followers on Instagram, chances are you’ve already heard of Theron Humphrey and his acrobatic dog, Maddie. The Tennessee-based photographer is famous for the quirky snapshots of Maddie balancing on random objects around the U.S. – a photographic tradition he launched more than three years ago. As the months went on, the poses became more elaborate. If you spend the time going through his archives of shots, you will not only witness the formation of a real bond between Humphrey and Maddie, but also the evolution in the photographer’s work from regular snapshots to aesthetically mastered works of art.  @mattcrump Dubbed the candy-colored minimalist, Matt Crump presents a psychedelic view of Texas. A former art director, he turned to photography after discovering Instagram and experimenting with colors (he uses a combination the apps TouchReTouch, VSCO and PicTapGo to produce his surreal compositions). He has no regrets about the switch, he says: “It seems to strike a happy chord with followers—they tell me how good it makes them feel, that my daily posts brighten their day, that they’re inspired. That’s my motivation.”  @ryan_thayne Ryan Thayne sees himself as a freelance wilderness photographer, and it’s hard to argue against this label when you see the photographs he shares of Utah. The state’s many geological features shine through his images – from its famous salt lakes to its mesmerizing green, yellow and orange mountains. “My goal is to share the beauty of the earth’s wilderness with people who might not be able to go out and see it for themselves,” he says. “I feel like nature is a great stress reliever and in this super sped-up modern world most people don’t get a chance to experience wilderness that often.” Thayne often tries to include a person in his photos, “not only to show scale,” he says, “but also to symbolize the connection between us and nature.”  @shanelavalette The black-and-white delicate aesthetic of Vermont photographer Shane Lavalette neatly plays with shapes, lights and shadows, as well as seductive silhouettes emerging in urban landscapes. Lavelette’s Instagram photographs, mostly posted without a caption, enable a freedom of interpretation that makes the viewer linger at the photographer’s evocative visual portfolio.  @taylortippett A flight attendant always on the go, Taylor Tippett is based out of Reagan National Airport in Virginia but she spends most of her time on planes, snapping shots of whatever inspires her during her erratic but exciting wandering. A lover of pineapple pizza and the wildflowers that she photographs in teeny bouquets, Tippett has started a little social movement by sticking thankful notes on the windows of airplanes and tagging them #WordsFromTheWindowSeat.  @hawkeyehuey Hawkeye Huey is the five-year-old son of National Geographic photographer Aaron Huey. Armed with his Fujifilm Instax 300, the young photographer has become an Instagram sensation – he has close to 100,000 followers – as he shares snapshots in and around Seattle and beyond. He’s even been signed by National Geographic Creative, which will become his agent. No doubt, Hawkeye has a bright future in photography ahead of him.  @stacykranitz Stacy Kranitz’s Instagram feed offers a raw, sincere and fascinating exploration of West Virginia and the Appalachia through the people she meets and the stories she recounts.  @kevinmiyazaki Kevin J. Miyazaki initially resisted Instagram, fearing that it would stifle his photography. But he soon changed his mind when he realized that the photo-sharing service kept him visually curious, as he says, just the way he felt when he first started taking pictures. The Wisconsin-based photographer doesn’t limit his work to his home state. In July, for example, he was in Japan, where he rediscovered his roots through a series of images he posted on his feed. “The process was quite important in how I experienced and recorded the trip,” he explains.  @dguttenfelder Best known for his groundbreaking work in North Korea, the Iowa-born David Guttenfelder relocated to Minnesota last year. Yet, for the past year, he’s been based in Wyoming. There, he has embarked on a thorough documentation of Yellowstone National Park for National Geographic, to be published in 2016. Expect to see a lot more of his Wyoming work in the coming weeks and months. \nDesign & Code by Alexander Ho & Dave Johnson  Your browser is out of date.

{"type": "article", "header": "Good News: Sitting All Day Isn’t as Bad for You if You’re Fit", "author": "Alice Park", "update_date/publish_date": "May 23, 2018 8:00 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/5289025/exercise-sitting-strength/", "text": "There is growing evidence that time spent sitting — in cars, at offices and on the couch — is having some seriously negative effects on health. Sedentary behavior has been linked to obesity, heart disease, diabetes and other chronic conditions. But a new study provides encouragement that some physical activity, including relatively simple ways to improve muscle strength, may be enough to overcome some of the unhealthy effects of sitting too much. In a study published in BMC Medicine, researchers led by Carlos Celis-Morales from the University of Glasgow analyzed data from nearly 400,000 middle-aged people in the UK. The scientists compared people’s reports on how much physical activity they did to their reports on how much time they spent in front of a TV or computer screen. To get more objective measures of people’s exercise levels, the scientists also conducted tests of grip strength, in which people squeezed a specialized device to measure their muscle strength, as well as fitness tests on an ergometer. While fitness tests are time consuming and expensive, grip strength is a useful proxy for how physically active and fit people are, says Celis-Morales, since it measures overall muscle strength and can be done quickly and easily by most doctors during an office visit. People who had the weakest grips had a 31% higher risk of dying over the study’s five-year follow-up for every two hours they spent in front of a screen, compared to people with stronger grips who spent similar amounts of time sitting down. These people also had a 21% higher risk of developing heart disease and a 14% higher risk of getting cancer, compared to people with higher grip strength. Essentially, for every two hours people spend sitting in front of a TV or computer, the risk of dying from any cause is about two times higher among people with lower grip strength than people with higher grip strength. The good news is that grip strength can be improved by weight training and moderate increases in physical activity and fitness, Celis-Morales says. “The overall message is that it may not matter so much if you watch a lot of TV if you are strong, fit and physically active,” he says. “If you move and are more active, [sitting] will not have the same effect on your health as if you are inactive.” It’s important to remember that sitting too much is still unhealthy, he says; compared to people who don’t sit as much, people who are more sedentary have higher rates of early death and chronic diseases. But among those must sit for most of the day, being more active can offset some of those detrimental effects. “Sometimes there nothing you can do at work if you spend eight hours in front of a computer or in a chair,” he says. “But when you go home, you can modify your behavior. You can do a lot of things to offset the effect of spending so many hours sitting during the day.” The results also suggest that recommendations that many countries have adopted recently — like those urging everyone to move more and sit less — may not be so effective for everyone, he says. Those guidelines may apply more to people who are both sedentary and relatively inactive; encouraging these people to exercise a little more could help them to avoid some of the negative health consequences of their sedentary behavior.

{"type": "article", "header": "Sitting Too Much Ages You By 8 Years", "author": "Alice Park", "update_date/publish_date": "January 18, 2017 3:00 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4637898/sitting-aging-sedentary/", "text": "Sitting too much during the day has been linked to a host of diseases, from obesity to heart problems and diabetes, as well as early death. It’s not hard to understand why: being inactive can contribute to weight gain, which in turn is a risk factor for heart attack, stroke, hypertension and unhealthy blood sugar levels. On top of everything else, sitting has detrimental effects on cells at the biological level, according to a new report published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. In the new study, scientists led by Aladdin Shadyab, a post-doctoral fellow in family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego, traced sitting’s impact on the chromosomes. They took blood samples from nearly 1,500 older women enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative, a long-term study of chronic diseases in post-menopausal women, and focused on the telomeres: the tips of the tightly packed DNA in every cell. Previous studies have found that as cells divide and age, they lose bits of the telomeres, so the length of this region can be a marker for how old a cell (and indirectly the person the cells belong to) is. The researchers compared telomere length to how much the women exercised, to see if physical activity affected aging. Earlier studies have also looked at telomere length and exercise. But they relied on asking people to report on their activity levels, a process that’s often inaccurate. Shadyab instead relied on more objective recordings of physical activity from accelerometers that the women wore for one week. Initially, he did not find any relationship between telomere length and physical activity levels. But when he focused on the women who did not meet the recommended 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily, he began to see some interesting trends. Among women who didn’t get the daily half hour of exercise, those who spent more time sedentary (about 10 hours or more) had shorter telomeres than those who spent less time sitting everyday. The amount of shortening added up to about eight years of aging, the scientists estimated—meaning that inactive women who spent more time sitting were about eight years older, on average, than those who were inactive but spent less time sedentary. Women who got the recommended amount of daily exercise showed no association between how much time they spent sitting and their telomere length, suggesting that physical activity might counteract the shortening that occurs with aging. “Our results suggest that the combination of being sedentary and not engaging in enough physical activity to prevent the telomeres from shortening leads to the shorter telomere length,” says Shadyab. “Women who did not meet the physical activity guideline and were sedentary for at least 10 hours a day were biologically older; their cells are aging faster than those of women who were less sedentary.” Exactly how much physical activity is needed to negate the aging effects of sitting on the cells isn’t clear yet. But Shadyab’s study shows that sedentary behavior has potentially aging effects on the cells, and exercise may be one way to combat that aging process.

In a new science advisory from the American Heart Association, researchers summarized existing evidence to conclude that sitting can be problematic for health, advising: “Sit less, move more.” Studies show that less time spent sitting correlates to better psychological well-being and better health-related quality of life, while more sitting time is “positively associated with depressive symptoms,” the advisory found. Sitting has a negative impact on the heart no matter how much physical activity a person gets otherwise, the researchers found. Still, more research is needed to determine just how much sitting time is safe, the researchers said. The latest advisory comes after researchers at the University of Exeter and University College London concluded that sitting time was not associated with increased mortality risk after tracking the work, TV-watching and other sitting habits of over 5,000 people for more than a decade and a half.

That’s because love come with some solid health benefits, according to a growing body of scientific research. Dr. Helen Riess, director of the Empathy and Relational Science Program at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of the forthcoming book The Empathy Effect, told TIME how falling head over heels can help your health, both mentally and physically. When you first fall in love, dopamine, the feel-good brain chemical associated with reward, is especially active. “That is a mood intensifier, so people feel extremely positive and very appreciated,” Riess says — hence that “on cloud nine” feeling you get in the throes of a new relationship. But new lovebirds also experience a spike in the stress hormone cortisol and a concurrent drop in the mood-regulating neurotransmitter serotonin, according to a letter from the Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute. That may account for some of the erratic behavior — passion mixed with anxiety, obsession and nervousness — that often goes along with blossoming love. Dopamine levels may stay elevated even as your love matures, studies suggest, but you’ll likely see cortisol and serotonin levels return to normal, helping you calm down and settle into the relationship without losing the mood-brightening perks. After the honeymoon phase subsides, all of that dopamine starts to share real estate with another brain chemical: oxytocin, or the bonding hormone. That not only gives you “warm and fuzzy” feelings for your partner, but it can also be good for your health, Riess says. “When people feel securely attached, their stress levels go down,” she says. “Just being in the presence of someone who greets us with positive regard and caring can actually lower those levels of cortisol and adrenaline and create greater homeostasis, which means that your neurochemicals are back in balance.” If you’re away from your significant other, thinking about them, talking to them on the phone or even texting with them can help conjure these feelings, Riess says. Quite a few studies have pointed to ways that loneliness can hurt your health, from increasing inflammation to activating pain centers. “The feeling of loneliness stimulates anxiety, which is mediated by different neurotransmitters, like norepinephrine,” Riess says. “Also, cortisol and adrenaline levels rise when people feel insecure and threatened,” which triggers your body’s stress response. Being in love and feeling close to another person can mitigate anxiety. The benefits of love aren’t all in your head. “Couples encourage each other to go to the doctor when they don’t want to,” Riess says. “There’s a lot of denial around medical illness, and individuals are more likely to shrug off something and say, ‘This can’t be serious.'” The data bears this out. People who are paired off may be able to detect melanoma earlier than singletons, since their partner can spot suspicious moles right away. The same goes for abnormal bruising, which can be a sign of serious conditions such as leukemia, kidney disease and Cushing’s disease, Riess says. Sometimes, partners will even notice signs of allergies or other persistent health problems before the sufferer does. Research has shown that married couples enjoy greater longevity than singles — making “’til death do us part” even more of a commitment. Studies suggest those long-life benefits are largely explained by consistent social and emotional support, better adherence to medical care and having a partner who can hold you accountable to healthy lifestyle behaviors and steer you away from bad ones. Married couples have been found to have lower rates of substance abuse, lower blood pressure and less depression than single peers. But there’s also good news for the unattached. In 2010, a review of 148 studies found that longevity benefits were linked to all close social relationships, not just romantic ones — meaning your friends and family are good for your health, too.

It’s well established that weekly exercise is important, and current government recommendations advise people to exercise for 150 minutes every week. But for people specifically interested in making sure their hearts are healthy, there’s been some debate over how much exercise is necessary. As people age, their arteries, which are critical for transporting blood in and out of the heart, are at risk for stiffening and causing disease. Though the researchers of the new study, which is published in the Journal of Physiology, say that any amount of exercise reduces the overall risk of death from heart disease, arteries can be affected differently by exercise, depending on their size. To better understand exercise and artery health, researchers looked at 102 men and women who were over age 60 and had logged their exercise histories for at least 25 years. The researchers measured their artery stiffness and separated them into different groups according to how often they exercised each week. Based on what they observed, the researchers concluded that people who reported regularly working out two to three times a week for at least 30 minutes a session had more youthful middle-sized arteries, which are important for blood flow to the head and neck. People who regularly exercised four to five times a week for at least 30 minutes had healthier large central arteries, which encourage blood flow to the chest and abdomen, as well as healthy middle-sized arteries, compared to people who exercised less. Exercising four to five times a week appears to be a sweet spot for overall artery health, at least for the people in the study. More research is needed, but the findings suggest a window of workouts to reach. The researchers did not detail what kind of exercise the people in the study did, so it’s hard to say exactly what amount of time and what intensity of exercise is ideal. However, the research team only counted the exercise sessions if it was of a moderate intensity, meaning the person would’ve been somewhat out of breath while doing it, says study author Dr. Benjamin Levine, a professor of internal medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center and founder and director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine. MORE: The TIME Guide to Exercise “I think the main take-home message is that exercise needs to be part of your personal hygiene,” says Levine, adding that getting exercise should become as normal as brushing your teeth or eating dinner. The researchers write in their study that the findings can help experts develop exercise plans and programs for heart health. The group’s previous research has shown that waiting until a person is 70 years old is typically too late to intervene with heart aging (though it may still provide other benefits to the heart and body), but if people can develop a regular exercise routine earlier in life, ideally before age 65, it can pay off. Levine recommends that his own patients do a workout that’s high intensity for them at least once a week. They should do moderately intense exercise two or three times a week, and on the weekend, they should spend one hour doing something physical but fun, like playing tennis or riding a bike. “That’s my prescription for life,” he says.

{"type": "article", "header": "How Strength Training Changes Your Body For Good", "author": "Mandy Oaklander", "update_date/publish_date": "July 6, 2017 12:03 PM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4824531/strength-training-women-exercise/", "text": "The following story is excerpted from TIME’s special edition, The Science of Exercise, which is available at Amazon. Dr. Dena Oaklander, a psychiatry resident—who also happens to be my sister—is the last person you’d ever expect to become a bodybuilder. She’s naturally scrawny and a little bit shy, not the type of person to beast out at the gym—or so I once thought. In medical school, she’d counsel patients on the importance of exercise and feel like a hypocrite, she says, since she did little but shuttle from home to the hospital, spending her rare free time catching up on sleep. “My body didn’t feel good, and my mind didn’t feel very good either,” she says. But once she started taking her own advice, as a resident at Loyola University Medical Center, Dena quickly became a hard-core strength-training fanatic. Within a month of learning how to lift weights, she noticed she had more energy without needing as much sleep, she felt far less stressed out, and she saw her body tone up fast. “Strength training is the only way you’re going to truly be able to sculpt the physique of your personal dreams,” says Sue Clark, a Chicago-based strength coach who trains Dena. “Above and beyond the physical changes, though, a whole new persona emerges as people start to feel really confident in their own bodies.” Clark saw the transformation in Dena, just as she has in many others. “Once I can get someone on board with strength training, they’re good for life, because they’re seeing results like they’ve never seen on cardio.” The average American flat-out loathes strength training. While about half of people do the recommended amount of aerobic activity each week, only 20% also do the muscle-strengthening moves that work major muscle groups. Yet the scientific benefits are stacking up in favor of it, from bone protection to disease prevention, and it appears to have special benefits for women. “There are so many misconceptions about strength and resistance training,” says Larry Tucker, a professor in exercise sciences at Brigham Young University. “One is that you’ll become muscle-bound”—so bulked up that your body becomes rigid. That myth was somewhat dispelled when athletes who started strength-training saw that they could hit a ball farther, jump higher and run faster, Tucker says. “Gradually we started realizing there are benefits beyond sports.” But women in particular are neglecting strength training at their own peril. It’s the only kind of exercise that makes muscles bigger, which lets them generate more strength and force, faster. “Muscle mass allows us to move,” Tucker says. Young people tend to take for granted the day-to-day parts of life that require strength, like walking up stairs or picking up a baby. “But a sedentary lifestyle means that people are gradually becoming weaker over time,” he says. Building muscle can fight back against that process. MORE: Why Weight Training Is Ridiculously Good For You It’s also one of the very few ways to make bones denser, a perk that is especially important for women. Lifting something heavy, like a dumbbell, makes bones bear more weight, and in exercise, stressing your bones is a good thing (to a point of course). Bones are constantly remodeling, explains Anthony Hackney, an exercise physiologist at the University of North Carolina. “Your body is always adding calcium to your bones and taking calcium away from your bones,” he says. This delicate balance starts to tip as people age, and “they lose more mineral from the bone than they’re able to lay down,” Hackney says. Over time, bone gets less dense and more brittle and prone to osteoporosis, a condition that affects about 10 million Americans—80% of whom are female. Women have smaller, thinner bones than men from the start, and after menopause they lose estrogen, a hormone that protects bones.   Strength training also comes with the less visible benefit of lowering risk for several diseases. “The only real way we can increase our metabolism, unless we take drugs, is to lift weights and maintain or increase our lean mass,” says Tucker. Doing so makes the body more sensitive to insulin, and therefore more durable against certain diseases. Recent research suggests that strength training may lower a woman’s risk for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In a 2016 study, researchers from Harvard Medical School and the National Institutes of Health used data from nearly 36,000 older women, who ranged in age from 47 to 98. The women filled out questionnaires for about a decade detailing their health and exercise levels, and one question asked women to estimate how much weightlifting or strength training they had done per week in the past year. The researchers then tracked which of the women had a heart attack or stroke and which developed Type 2 diabetes. Whether or not a woman did muscle-strengthening exercises indicated a lot about her health. Compared with women who avoided it, those who did any amount of strength training were more likely to have a lower body mass index and a healthier diet and less likely to be a current smoker. They also had a Type 2 diabetes risk that was 30% lower and a cardiovascular disease risk 17% lower than those who did no strength training, even after the researchers controlled for other variables like age, diet and physical activity. Adding aerobic exercise helped drive both risks down even more. Those who did at least 120 minutes a week of aerobic exercise and some strength training had a Type 2 diabetes risk 65% lower than women who didn’t do either. Most people should do both kinds of exercise for the biggest gains. But if you had to choose one, Clark advises, pick strength training. “Cardio is more digestible, it’s less intimidating, but people also get less and less out of it over time,” she says. As you grow fitter, you have to do more and more aerobic exercise to see the gains, she explains. Strength training, in her view, is the most efficient exercise for those with limited time. Powerlifting isn’t the only way to get results. Strength training comes in far more accessible forms as well—many of which do not even require a gym membership and certainly don’t require a personal trainer. Resistance bands, cheap strips of elastic that loop around arms or legs, are one good way to build strength without weights, for instance. A 2017 study showed that when frail women over 60 who were obese worked out with resistance bands for three months, they dropped body fat and increased bone density. Another option that involves even less equipment is to use your own body weight. Sitting up and down in a chair many times builds strength, as does jumping, which uses many of the legs’ major muscles. Even walking can count as strength training, depending on the intensity. The right type and amount will be different for every woman (and man, for that matter), but a little bit every day will do wonders. Just ask Dena, who is planning to enter her first bodybuilding competition a year after picking up her first weight. “Not only do I look better than when I first started, but I also feel really confident,” she says. “Strength training opens up your thoughts for more positive thinking.” Dena still urges her patients to exercise. But these days, it’s a prescription she really believes. Not everyone will become a bodybuilder, but most can get stronger and feel better by moving just a little bit more. “I find myself really encouraging patients to turn to exercise as an outlet or a way to help them cope with some of the difficult things they’re dealing with in life,” she says. “The message is different now, because I do it myself.” Write to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4803697/bodybuilding-strength-training/", "http://time.com/4618826/strength-training-fitness-workout/?iid=sr-link2"], "sentiment_score": 0.1901151767940088, "subjectivity_score": 0.48815085158150884},

Fortunately, says that same study on heart health published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, it doesn’t take much to offset the harmful effects of sitting. Because exercise has a more powerful effect in helping the heart than sitting does in harming it, one hour of physical exercise could counteract the effects of sitting for six to seven hours a day, according to researchers led by Dr. Jarett Berry at UT Southwestern Medical Center. (MORE: It’s Lack of Exercise — Not Calories — That Makes Us Fat, Study Says) The data Berry and his team reviewed came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, an ongoing series of health studies maintained by the Centers for Disease Control. The 2,223 participants between the ages of 12 and 49 wore accelerometers for seven days (except while showering or swimming) to measure their activity levels and sedentary behavior, and the result showed that sitting, regardless of the total amount of physical activity the people did, was linked to lower heart fitness. But it also found that men and women who logged less time sitting had better fitness, as measured on a treadmill test, than those who spent more hours in a chair or on the couch. So instead of focusing on working out, those worried about their health might think instead about sitting less. “Even people who exercise regularly spend the vast majority of their time not exercising,” says Berry. “And it appears that what we do when we’re not exercising is relevant to our health. Understanding this has the ability to shift the paradigm of thinking about exercise more dramatically than anything else in the field of exercise.” (MORE: Exercise Snacking: How to Make 1 Minute of Exercise Work Like 30 Minutes) In general, Berry says, any movement, from walking to taking the stairs and even fidgeting if you absolutely have to be in a chair, is likely better than sitting relatively motionless. “Much more work needs to be done, to develop small scale trials to test the impact that lifestyle changes have irrespective of volitional physical activity,” he says. “We spend so much of our time sitting and doing non-exercise-related activities that it’s relevant for us to understand that better.”   Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/8773/now-theres-another-reason-sitting-will-kill-you/", "http://time.com/2884953/sitting-can-increase-your-risk-of-cancer-by-up-to-66/", "http://time.com/2964554/its-lack-of-exercise-not-calories-that-make-us-fat-study-says/", "http://time.com/92972/exercise-snacking-how-to-make-1-minute-of-exercise-work-like-30-minutes/"], "sentiment_score": 0.15656565656565657, "subjectivity_score": 0.4418331668331668},

It was 2 in the morning, and as her parents slept, she sat on the edge of the tub at her home outside Bangor, Maine, with a metal clip from a pen in her hand. Then she sliced into the soft skin near her ribs. There was blood–and a sense of deep relief. “It makes the world very quiet for a few seconds,” says Faith-Ann. “For a while I didn’t want to stop, because it was my only coping mechanism. I hadn’t learned any other way.” The pain of the superficial wound was a momentary escape from the anxiety she was fighting constantly, about grades, about her future, about relationships, about everything. Many days she felt ill before school. Sometimes she’d throw up, other times she’d stay home. “It was like asking me to climb Mount Everest in high heels,” she says. It would be three years before Faith-Ann, now 20 and a film student in Los Angeles, told her parents about the depth of her distress. She hid the marks on her torso and arms, and hid the sadness she couldn’t explain and didn’t feel was justified. On paper, she had a good life. She loved her parents and knew they’d be supportive if she asked for help. She just couldn’t bear seeing the worry on their faces. For Faith-Ann, cutting was a secret, compulsive manifestation of the depression and anxiety that she and millions of teenagers in the U.S. are struggling with. Self-harm, which some experts say is on the rise, is perhaps the most disturbing symptom of a broader psychological problem: a spectrum of angst that plagues 21st century teens. Adolescents today have a reputation for being more fragile, less resilient and more overwhelmed than their parents were when they were growing up. Sometimes they’re called spoiled or coddled or helicoptered. But a closer look paints a far more heartbreaking portrait of why young people are suffering. Anxiety and depression in high school kids have been on the rise since 2012 after several years of stability. It’s a phenomenon that cuts across all demographics–suburban, urban and rural; those who are college bound and those who aren’t. Family financial stress can exacerbate these issues, and studies show that girls are more at risk than boys. In 2015, about 3 million teens ages 12 to 17 had had at least one major depressive episode in the past year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. More than 2 million report experiencing depression that impairs their daily function. About 30% of girls and 20% of boys–totaling 6.3 million teens–have had an anxiety disorder, according to data from the National Institute of Mental Health. Experts suspect that these statistics are on the low end of what’s really happening, since many people do not seek help for anxiety and depression. A 2015 report from the Child Mind Institute found that only about 20% of young people with a diagnosable anxiety disorder get treatment. It’s also hard to quantify behaviors related to depression and anxiety, like nonsuicidal self-harm, because they are deliberately secretive.

Still, the number of distressed young people is on the rise, experts say, and they are trying to figure out how best to help. Teen minds have always craved stimulation, and their emotional reactions are by nature urgent and sometimes debilitating. The biggest variable, then, is the climate in which teens navigate this stage of development. They are the post-9/11 generation, raised in an era of economic and national insecurity. They’ve never known a time when terrorism and school shootings weren’t the norm. They grew up watching their parents weather a severe recession, and, perhaps most important, they hit puberty at a time when technology and social media were transforming society. “If you wanted to create an environment to churn out really angsty people, we’ve done it,” says Janis Whitlock, director of the Cornell Research Program on Self-Injury and Recovery. Sure, parental micromanaging can be a factor, as can school stress, but Whitlock doesn’t think those things are the main drivers of this epidemic. “It’s that they’re in a cauldron of stimulus they can’t get away from, or don’t want to get away from, or don’t know how to get away from,” she says. In my dozens of conversations with teens, parents, clinicians and school counselors across the country, there was a pervasive sense that being a teenager today is a draining full-time job that includes doing schoolwork, managing a social-media identity and fretting about career, climate change, sexism, racism–you name it. Every fight or slight is documented online for hours or days after the incident. It’s exhausting. “We’re the first generation that cannot escape our problems at all,” says Faith-Ann. “We’re all like little volcanoes. We’re getting this constant pressure, from our phones, from our relationships, from the way things are today.” Steve Schneider, a counselor at Sheboygan South High School in southeastern Wisconsin, says the situation is like a scab that’s constantly being picked. “At no point do you get to remove yourself from it and get perspective,” he says. It’s hard for many adults to understand how much of teenagers’ emotional life is lived within the small screens on their phones, but a CNN special report in 2015 conducted with researchers at the University of California, Davis, and the University of Texas at Dallas examined the social-media use of more than 200 13-year-olds. Their analysis found that “there is no firm line between their real and online worlds,” according to the researchers. Phoebe Gariepy, a 17-year-old in Arundel, Maine, describes following on Instagram a girl in Los Angeles whom she’d never met because she liked the photos she posted. Then the girl stopped posting. Phoebe later heard she’d been kidnapped and was found on the side of a road, dead. “I started bawling, and I didn’t even know this girl,” says Phoebe. “I felt really extremely connected to that situation even though it was in L.A.” That hyperconnectedness now extends everywhere, engulfing even rural teens in a national thicket of Internet drama. Daniel Champer, the director of school-based services for Intermountain in Helena, Mont., says the one word he’d use to describe the kids in his state is overexposed. Montana’s kids may be in a big, sparsely populated state, but they are not isolated anymore. A suicide might happen on the other side of the state and the kids often know before the adults, says Champer. This makes it hard for counselors to help. And nearly 30% of the state’s teens said they felt sad and hopeless almost every day for at least two weeks in a row, according to the 2015 Montana Youth Risk Behavior Survey. To address what they consider a cry for help from the state’s teens, officials in Montana are working on expanding access to school-based and tele-based counseling. Megan Moreno, head of social media and adolescent health research at Seattle Children’s Hospital, notes a big difference between the mobile-social-tech revolution of the past 15 years and things like the introduction of the telephone or TV. In the olden days, your mom told you to get off the family phone or turn off the TV, and you did it. This time, kids are in the driver’s seat. Parents are also mimicking teen behavior. “Not in all cases, obviously, but in many cases the adults are learning to use their phones in the way that the teens do,” says Moreno. “They’re zoning out. They’re ignoring people. They’re answering calls during dinner rather than saying, ‘O.K., we have this technology. Here are the rules about when we use it.’” She cautions against demonizing technology entirely. “I often tell parents my simplest analogy is it’s like a hammer. You know, you can build a house that’s never existed before and you can smash someone’s head in, and it’s the same tool.” Sometimes phones rob teens’ developing brains of essential downtime. But other times they’re a way to maintain healthy social connections and get support. Nora Carden, 17, of Brooklyn, who started college in upstate New York this fall, says she’s relieved when she goes on a trip that requires her to leave her phone for a while. “It’s like the whole school is in your bag, waiting for an answer,” she says. School pressures also play a role, particularly with stress. Nora got counseling for her anxiety, which became crushing as the college-application process ramped up. She’d fear getting an answer wrong when a teacher called on her, and often felt she was not qualified to be in a particular class. “I don’t have pressure from my parents. I’m the one putting pressure on myself,” she says. “The competitiveness, the lack of clarity about where things are going [economically] have all created a sense of real stress,” says Victor Schwartz of the Jed Foundation, a nonprofit that works with colleges and universities on mental-health programs and services. “Ten years ago, the most prominent thing kids talked about was feeling depressed. And now anxiety has overtaken that in the last couple of years.” Tommy La Guardia, a high-achieving 18-year-old senior in Kent, Wash., is the first college-bound kid in his family. He recently became a finalist for prestigious scholarships, all while working 10 to 15 hours a week at a Microsoft internship and helping to care for his younger brothers. His mom, Catherine Moimoi, says he doesn’t talk about the pressure he’s under. They don’t have a lot of resources, yet he manages everything himself, including college tours and applications. “He’s a good kid. He never complains,” she says. “But there are many nights I go to sleep wondering how he does it.” Tommy admits that the past year was tough. “It’s hard to describe the stress,” he says. “I’m calm on the outside, but inside it’s like a demon in your stomach trying to consume you.” He deals with those emotions on his own. “I don’t want to make it someone else’s problem.” Alison Heyland, 18, a recent high school graduate, was part of a group in Maine called Project Aware, whose members seek to help their peers manage anxiety and depression by making films. “We’re such a fragile and emotional generation,” she says. “It’s tempting for parents to tell kids, ‘Just suck it up.’” But, says Alison, “I feel like it really is less realistic for you to go after your dream job today. You’re more apt to go do a job that you don’t really like because it pays better and you’ll be in less debt.” Meanwhile, evidence suggests the anxiety wrought by school pressures and technology is affecting younger and younger kids. Ellen Chance, co-president of the Palm Beach School Counselor Association, says technology and online bullying are affecting kids as early as fifth grade. The strain on school counselors has increased since No Child Left Behind standardized testing protocols were implemented in the past decade. Tests can run from January through May, and since counselors in Chance’s county are often the ones who administer the exams, they have less time to deal with students’ mental-health issues. “I couldn’t tell you how many students are being malicious to each other over Instagram or Snapchat,” she says of the elementary school where she’s the sole counselor for more than 500 kids. “I’ve had cases where girls don’t want to come to school because they feel outcasted and targeted. I deal with it on a weekly basis.” Conventional wisdom says kids today are oversupervised, prompting some parenting critics to look back fondly to the days of latchkey kids. But now, even though teens may be in the same room with their parents, they might also, thanks to their phones, be immersed in a painful emotional tangle with dozens of their classmates. Or they’re looking at other people’s lives on Instagram and feeling self-loathing (or worse). Or they’re caught up in a discussion about suicide with a bunch of people on the other side of the country they’ve never even met via an app that most adults have never heard of. Phoebe Gariepy says she remembers being in the backseat of a car with her headphones on, sitting next to her mom while looking at disturbing photos on her phone on social-media feeds about cutting. “I was so distant, I was so separated,” she says. She says it was hard to get out of that online community, as gory as it was, because her online life felt like her real life. “It’s almost like a reality-TV show. That’s the most triggering part of it, knowing that those real people were out there.” It would be hard for most people to know that the girl sitting there scrolling through her phone was engaged in much more than superficial selfies. Josh, who did not want his real name published, is a high school sophomore in Maine who says he remembers how his parents began checking on him after the Sandy Hook shooting that killed 20 children and six adults. Despite their vigilance, he says, they’re largely unaware of the pain he’s been in. “They’re both heterosexual cis people, so they wouldn’t know that I’m bisexual. They wouldn’t know that I cut, that I use red wine, that I’ve attempted suicide,” he says. “They think I’m a normal kid, but I’m not.” In the CNN study, researchers found that even when parents try their best to monitor their children’s Instagram, Twitter and Facebook feeds, they are likely unable to recognize the subtle slights and social exclusions that cause kids pain. Finding disturbing things in a child’s digital identity, or that they’re self-harming, can stun some parents. “Every single week we have a girl who comes to the ER after some social-media rumor or incident has upset her [and then she cut herself],” says Fadi Haddad, a psychiatrist who helped start the child and adolescent psychiatric emergency department at Bellevue hospital in New York City, the first of its kind at a public hospital. Teens who end up there are often sent by administrators at their school. When Haddad calls the parents, they can be unaware of just how distressed their child is. According to Haddad, this includes parents who feel they’re very involved in their children’s lives: they’re at every sports game, they supervise the homework, they’re part of the school community. Sometimes when he calls, they’re angry. One mother whose child Haddad treated told him that she found out her daughter had 17 Facebook accounts, which the mother shut down. “But what good does that do?” says Haddad. “There will be an 18th.” For some parents who discover, as Faith-Ann’s parents Bret and Tammy Bishop did a few years ago, that their child has been severely depressed, anxiety-ridden or self-harming for years, it’s a shock laden with guilt. Bret says Faith-Ann had been making cuts on her legs and ribs for three years before she got the courage to tell her parents. “You wonder, What could I have done better?” he says. Looking back, he realizes that he was distracted too much of the time. “Even for us as adults, you’re never away from work now. Before, there wasn’t anything to worry about till I got back on Monday. But now it’s always on your phone. Sometimes when you’re home, you’re not home,” Bret says. When Bret and Tammy joined a group for parents of kids with depression, he discovered that there were many girls and some boys who were also depressed and hurting themselves, and that few parents had any idea of what was going on. Tammy said she wishes she’d followed her gut and taken Faith-Ann for counseling earlier. “I knew something was wrong, and I couldn’t figure it out,” she says. Self-harm is certainly not universal among kids with depression and anxiety, but it does appear to be the signature symptom of this generation’s mental-health difficulties. All of the nearly two dozen teens I spoke with for this story knew someone who had engaged in self-harm or had done it themselves. It’s hard to quantify the behavior, but its impact is easier to monitor: a Seattle Children’s Hospital study that tracked hashtags people use on Instagram to talk about self-harm found a dramatic increase in their use in the past two years. Researchers got 1.7 million search results for “#selfharmmm” in 2014; by 2015 the number was more than 2.4 million. While girls appear more likely to engage in this behavior, boys are not immune: as many as 30% to 40% of those who’ve ever self-injured are male. The academic study of this behavior is nascent, but researchers are developing a deeper understanding of how physical pain may relieve the psychological pain of some people who practice it. That knowledge may help experts better understand why it can be hard for some people to stop self-harming once they start. Whitlock, the director of the self-injury research program at Cornell, explains that studies are pretty consistent in showing that people who injure themselves do it to cope with anxiety or depression. It’s hard to know why self-harm has surfaced at this time, and it’s possible we’re just more aware of it now because we live in a world where we’re more aware of everything. Whitlock thinks there’s a cultural element to it. Starting in the late 1990s, the body became a kind of billboard for self-expression–that’s when tattoos and piercings went mainstream. “As that was starting to happen, the idea of etching your emotional pain into your body was not a big step from the body as a canvas as an idea,” she says. The idea that self-harm is tied to how we see the human body tracks with what many teens told me when I interviewed them. As Faith-Ann describes it, “A lot of value is put on our physical beauty now. All of our friends are Photoshopping their own photos–it’s hard to escape that need to be perfect.” Before the dawn of social media, the disorders that seemed to be the quintessential reflection of those same societal pressures were anorexia or bulimia–which are still serious concerns. Whitlock says there are two common experiences that people have with self-harm. There are those who feel disconnected or numb. “They don’t feel real, and there’s something about pain and blood that brings them into their body,” she says. On the other end of the spectrum are people who feel an overwhelming amount of emotion, says Whitlock. “If you asked them to describe those emotions on a scale of 1 to 10, they would say 10, while you or I might rate the same experience as a 6 or 7. They need to discharge those feelings somehow, and injury becomes their way,” she explains. The research on what happens in the brain and body when someone cuts is still emerging. Scientists want to better understand how self-harm engages the endogenous opioid system–which is involved in the pain response in the brain–and what happens if and when it does. Some of the treatments for self-harm are similar to those for addiction, particularly in the focus on identifying underlying psychological issues–what’s causing the anxiety and depression in the first place–and then teaching healthy ways to cope. Similarly, those who want to stop need a strong level of internal motivation. “You’re not going to stop for somebody else,” explains Phoebe, the teenager from Maine. Even thinking about how upset her mother was about the self-harm wasn’t enough. “I tried making pacts with friends. But it doesn’t work. You have to figure it out for yourself. You have to make the choice.” Eventually, Phoebe steered herself out of the dark, destructive corners of the Internet that reinforced her habit by romanticizing and validating her pain. She’s now into holistic healing and looks at positive sites populated by people she calls “happy hippies.” Faith-Ann remembers the day her mother Tammy noticed the scars on her arms and realized what they were. By then she was a junior in high school. “I normally cut in places you couldn’t see, but I had messed up and I had a cut on my wrists. I lifted my arm to move my hair, and she saw it. It was scary because the cuts were in a place that people associate with suicide.” That was not what she was attempting, however. “If she’d asked me before that if I was cutting, I would have said no. I wouldn’t have wanted to put that pain on her,” says Faith-Ann. But that night she said, “Yes, I am cutting, and I want to stop.” Tammy cried for a bit, but they moved on. She didn’t ask why, she didn’t freak out, she just asked what she could do to help. “That was the exact right thing to do,” says Faith-Ann. The family got counseling after that. Her parents learned that they weren’t alone. And Faith-Ann learned breathing techniques to calm herself physically and how to talk to herself positively. Recovery didn’t happen all at once. There were relapses, sometimes over tiny things. But the Bishops were on the right road. One of the most powerful things Faith-Ann did to escape the cycle of anxiety, depression and self-harm was to channel her feelings into something creative. As part of the Project Aware teen program in Maine, she wrote and directed a short film about anxiety and depression in teens called The Road Back. More than 30 kids worked on the project, and they became a support system for one another as she continued to heal. “I had a place where I could be open and talk about my life and the issues I was having, and then I could project them in an artistic way,” she says. Bellevue’s Fadi Haddad says that for parents who find out their children are depressed or hurting themselves, the best response is first to validate their feelings. Don’t get angry or talk about taking away their computers. “Say, ‘I’m sorry you’re in pain. I’m here for you,’” he says. This straightforward acknowledgment of their struggles takes away any judgment, which is critical since mental-health issues are still heavily stigmatized. No adolescent wants to be seen as flawed or vulnerable, and for parents, the idea that their child has debilitating depression or anxiety or is self-harming can feel like a failure on their part. Alison Heyland’s dad Neil says that initially, it was hard to find people to confide in about his daughter’s depression. “I see everyone putting up posts about their family, they look so happy and everyone’s smiling, everything is so perfect and rosy. I kind of feel less than,” he says. For both generations, admitting that they need help can be daunting. Even once they get past that barrier, the cost and logistics of therapy can be overwhelming. Faith-Ann still struggles at times with depression and anxiety. “It’s a condition that’s not going to totally disappear from my life,” she says over the phone from Los Angeles, where she’s thriving at film school. “It’s just learning how to deal in a healthy way–not self-harming, not lashing out at people.” Of course Bret and Tammy Bishop still worry about her. They now live in Hampstead, N.C., and at first Bret didn’t like the idea of Faith-Ann’s going to school in California. If she was having trouble coping, he and Tammy were a long plane ride away. How can you forget that your child, someone you’ve dedicated years to keeping safe from the perils of the world, has deliberately hurt herself? “It’s with you forever,” says Tammy. These days, she and Bret are proud of their daughter’s independence and the new life she’s created. But like a lot of parents who’ve feared for their child’s health, they don’t take the ordinary for granted anymore.

Over the years, her mother’s diagnoses changed frequently—from personality disorder to alcoholism—eventually rupturing her family. “My mother has caused our family a lot of pain over the years,” Spitz says. After her parents ended their 27-year marriage and her father left their home in St. Louis, and her brother Adam became more estranged because of his mother’s behavior, Spitz became the primary caretaker, traveling home every other week while juggling her photography studies at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Mo., and later during graduate work at Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Ga. in her early 20s. Inevitably, her mother became her central focus. “My [photography] background and this project are kind of blended, and it was this thing that happened in unison,” the 26-year-old photographer tells TIME. Spitz did not think that documenting her mother could make a substantial body of work until she saw the similarly intimate and intriguing photographs of Richard Billingham, Nan Goldin and Tierney Gearon, who unapologetically exhibited the private lives of their loved ones in a public display. “I really wasn’t aware that that was something photographers did.” Yet, to fully confront the moments of chaos and, at times, ugliness of life — emotions often concealed outside of close family circles — was a difficult journey. When Deborah was hospitalized after a car accident and begged Spitz to document it, she couldn’t raise her camera. “I remember telling her that this makes me feel bad, like I’m doing something wrong,” Spitz says. But as time went by and hospital visits stacked up, Spitz says that Deborah told her: “This is my life, Melissa. If you’re going to do this, you need to just go all in.” Since then, her mother has become more than just a subject; she’s a collaborator. The experience has served as an emotional and therapeutic bridge between the two, channeling a relationship that had long faltered. “Now I can’t think of a time that I haven’t photographed her, even when she’s been in hospital. I just try and let her have as much control as possible.” Once, Spitz took her mother back to the high school where Deborah had been a popular cheerleader, and sat her down on the bleacher for a portrait. “She just started screaming and crying,” Spitz recalls, “It was really fake at first but she kept doing that, and all of a sudden [she] had this tone that was just so real and full of pain.” In that moment, Spitz’s own long-repressed emotions about her mother’s illness erupted. “That was when I knew that the work was a conversation that was not only me watching her but also an echo of how I feel about living and dealing with her.” But as the world of photography opens doors to self-reflective and sensitive examination, accusations of exploitation also arise. And Spitz understands how turning the lens on her mother can affect Deborah’s behavior. “I am fully aware that my mother thrives on being the center of attention and that, at times, our portrait sessions encourage her erratic behavior,” Spitz says. “There are people who think I exploited my mom, and think that I’m doing something wrong, and then there’re people who think I’m doing something very important.” “My hope for the [story] is to show that these issues can happen to anyone, from any walk of life and that there is nothing to be ashamed about,” she adds. Now, Deborah, 60, works as a greeter at a Home Depot store in St. Louis, a job created by Missouri’s Social Security Disability Insurance program. She tells TIME that she hopes sharing her story could help de-stigmatize mental illness. For the photographer, the investment on a project, which already stretched half a decade and is still ongoing, is worth it. “I can finally take something I love doing and share it with my mom,” she says. “It’s been a mirror for both of us to see our lives.” Melissa Spitz is a photographer who divides her time between the Midwest and New York. She plans to make a book about her mother’s project, You Have Nothing to Worry About. You can also follow her on Instagram.

{"type": "article", "header": "The New Science of Exercise", "author": "Mandy Oaklander", "update_date/publish_date": "September 12, 2016 7:47 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4475628/the-new-science-of-exercise/", "text": "Ever since high school, Dr. Mark Tarnopolsky has blurred the line between jock and nerd. After working out every morning and doing 200 push-ups, he runs three miles to his lab at McMaster University in Ontario. When he was younger, Tarnopolsky dreamed of becoming a gym teacher. But now, in his backup career as a genetic metabolic neurologist, he’s determined to prove that exercise can be used as medicine for even the sickest patients. “People would always say to me, ‘Exercise? Come on. Scientifically, you can’t come up with a mechanism, so it’s a complete waste of time,'” Tarnopolsky says. “But as time goes on, paper after paper after paper shows that the most effective, potent way that we can improve quality of life and duration of life is exercise.” Tarnopolsky has published some of those papers himself. In 2011, he and a team studied mice with a terrible genetic disease that caused them to age prematurely. Over the course of five months, half of the mice were sedentary. The other half were coaxed to run three times a week on a miniature treadmill. By the end of the study, the sedentary mice were barely hanging on. The fur that had yet to fall out had grown coarse and gray, muscles shriveled, hearts weakened, skin thinned–even the mice’s hearing got worse. “They were shivering in the corner, about to die,” Tarnopolsky says. But the group of mice that exercised, genetically compromised though they were, were nearly indistinguishable from healthy mice. Their coats were sleek and black, they ran around their cages, they could even reproduce. “We almost completely prevented the premature aging in the animals,” Tarnopolsky says. That’s remarkable news, if you’re a mouse. And though there are obvious differences between rodents and humans, Tarnopolsky has seen something similar happen in his ill patients. “I’ve seen all the hype about gene therapy for people with genetic disease”–Tarnopolsky treats kids with severe genetic diseases like muscular dystrophy–“but it hasn’t delivered in the 25 years I’ve been doing this,” he says. “The most effective therapy available to my patients right now is exercise.” Looking to get in shape but don’t know where to start? Sign up for TIME’s guide to getting fitter, faster.  Tarnopolsky now thinks he knows why. In studies where blood is drawn immediately after people exercised, researchers have found that many positive changes occur throughout the body during and right after a workout. “Going for a run is going to improve your skin health, your eye health, your gonadal health,” he says. “It’s unbelievable.” If there were a drug that could do for human health everything that exercise can, it would likely be the most valuable pharmaceutical ever developed. The trouble is only 20% of Americans get the recommended 150 minutes of strength and cardiovascular physical activity per week, more than half of all baby boomers report doing no exercise whatsoever, and 80.2 million Americans over age 6 are entirely inactive. The consequences of a sedentary life are as well documented as they are dire. People with low levels of physical activity are at higher risk for many different kinds of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease and early death by any cause. That’s at the end of life. Long before that, inactivity can worsen arthritis symptoms, increase lower-back pain and lead to depression and anxiety–not to mention cause a sallow complexion. Despite public-awareness campaigns, the health benefits of exercise have not been effectively communicated to the average American. Humans are notoriously bad at assessing the long-term benefits–and risks–of their lifestyle choices. And vague promises that exercise is “good for you” or even “good for the heart” aren’t powerful enough to motivate most people to do something they think of as a chore. Humans are, however, motivated by rewards. That is why experts like Tarnopolsky are so focused on proving that the scientific benefits of exercise–slower aging, better mood, less chronic pain, stronger vision, the list goes on–are real, measurable and almost immediate. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) is on the bandwagon too. Next year the agency will launch a massive new study with the aim of documenting in unprecedented detail exactly what happens inside a body in motion. Its hope: to prove that exercise is medicine. Before doctors adopted a single-minded focus on treating and curing diseases, their main goal was to keep people healthy. Even back in 400 B.C., doctors knew that diet and exercise were the best ways to do that. “Eating alone will not keep a man well,” Hippocrates famously wrote. “He must also take exercise.” For millennia, doctors were the vanguards of physical education–the original PE teachers. But in the early 1900s, with the rise of modern surgery and nascent pharmaceuticals, medicine shifted its focus from the prevention of disease to its treatment. Paradoxically, physicians de-emphasized exercise just as the modern Olympics swelled in popularity and colleges began building campus stadiums to accommodate America’s growing love of spectator sports. The authors of a paper published in a 1905 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association mourned how many people were losing sight of the health benefits of exercise. “The men on the teams are the very ones whom Nature has endowed superabundantly with physical capacity, but on them the physical director bends most of his energies,” they wrote, “while the average student is left to get his physical development by yelling from the bleachers.” Physical activity was no longer the medicine of the masses but the privilege of elite athletes. When scientists studied exercise, it was to figure out how athletes could improve their peak performance–not how mere mortals could improve their health day to day. This gap persists. At a time when boutique (read: expensive) fitness studios are more popular than ever, fewer people are getting the minimum recommended amount of exercise. Worse, many U.S. schools have seen gym classes cut from the curriculum; nearly half of high school students don’t have weekly PE class, and only 15% of elementary schools require PE at least three days a week for the school year. The result: the majority of American kids and adolescents have so-called exercise-deficit disorder. Meanwhile, childhood-obesity rates have climbed every year since 1999. “You have whole generations that are soured on exercise,” says Jack Berryman, professor emeritus of medical history at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Researchers like Tarnopolsky and Marcas Bamman, an exercise physiologist who also wants to be part of the NIH study, are hoping that their work will begin reversing those trends. Next year the NIH will launch its six-year, $170 million study with a group of about 3,000 sedentary people, ranging in age from children to the elderly. They will start an exercise program and then donate blood, fat and muscle before and after they exercise. Scientists will then examine samples for clues to how the body changes with physical activity. A control group that doesn’t exercise will also be tracked for comparison. As part of the study, researchers will do the same experiment in animals to get tissue samples from places like the brain and the lungs that would be too dangerous to obtain from humans. “It’ll be a tremendously enormous data set,” says Maren Laughlin, program director for integrative metabolism at the NIH, who is also a lead on the new study. In the end, the researchers think they’ll be able to identify every single molecule in the body that’s tweaked or turned on by exercise. This kind of study–its size, its rigor, its aims–is a first, and experts are hoping it will give doctors the evidence they need to start treating exercise like the miracle drug they’ve long thought it to be. “If you think of exercise as a true form of medicine, which it is, it’s not good enough to just look at a patient and say, ‘You need to do more exercise,'” says Bamman, director of the Center for Exercise Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “That’s no better than handing someone a bottle of pills and saying, ‘Here, take a few,'” with no other explanation. Bamman is betting that with this new data, exercise will one day be prescribed to patients. Instead of leaving the doctor’s office with nothing but a slip of paper with a drug name scrawled on it, patients may also get a detailed exercise plan tailored to make their medication work better. “We think that precision will go a long way in changing behavior,” Bamman says. “We’re at a really important time in the field.” Think of all the different ways you can sweat and you might be surprised that each falls into one of just two categories. You’re doing aerobic exercise when your breathing speeds up, your blood flows faster and your heart pumps more of it, shooting oxygen out to the tissues in the rest of the body. It’s the most popular kind; about half of Americans meet the recommendations for aerobic physical activity. But only 20% also do the other type, strength training. The phrase may conjure grunting weight lifters and gym dumbbells slick with sweat, but to build muscle and strengthen bones, you really only need to use your body weight as resistance, says Anthony Hackney, an exercise physiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That’s why things like yoga, tai chi and Pilates–not just pumping iron–are excellent forms of strength training. “People always get the image of the big, muscular guy,” Hackney says. “We try to think of muscle strength and power as a 65-year-old lady picking up a gallon of milk, pouring a glass and feeling comfortable.” In addition to the heart, muscles, lungs and bones, scientists are finding that another major beneficiary of exercise might be the brain. Recent research links exercise to less depression, better memory and quicker learning. Studies also suggest that exercise is, as of now, the best way to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s, which is second only to cancer as the disease Americans fear most, according to surveys. Scientists don’t know exactly why exercise changes the structure and function of the brain for the better, but it’s an area of active research. So far, they’ve found that exercise improves blood flow to the brain, feeding the growth of new blood vessels and even new brain cells, courtesy of the protein BDNF, short for brain-derived neurotrophic factor. BDNF triggers the growth of new neurons and helps repair and protect brain cells from degeneration. “I always tell people that exercise is regenerative medicine–restoring and repairing and basically fixing things that are broken,” Bamman says. Repairs like this throughout the body may be the reason exercise has been shown to extend life span by as much as five years. A small new study suggests that moderate-intensity exercise may slow down the aging of cells. As humans get older and their cells divide over and over again, their telomeres–the protective caps on the end of chromosomes–get shorter. To see how exercise affects telomeres, researchers took a muscle biopsy and blood samples from 10 healthy people before and after a 45-minute ride on a stationary bicycle. They found that exercise increased levels of a molecule that protects telomeres, ultimately slowing how quickly they shorten over time. Exercise, then, appears to slow aging at the cellular level. For all its merits, however, exercise is not an effective way to lose weight, research has shown. In a cruel twist, many people actually gain weight after they start exercising, whether from new muscle mass or a fired-up appetite. “Some people say exercise doesn’t do anything,” says researcher John Jakicic of the University of Pittsburgh. “Well, exercise does a lot. It just may not show up on the scale.” One of the best pieces of news is that so much of what we already do counts as physical activity. “Mowing the grass, raking leaves, washing the car–all that’s exercise,” says Berryman, the exercise historian. “Physical activity includes all movement, not just throwing a ball through a basket.” What’s more, emerging research suggests that it doesn’t take much movement to get the benefits. “We’ve been interested in the question of, How low can you go?” says Martin Gibala, an exercise physiologist at McMaster University. After all, if it were possible to reap all the health benefits of exercise in a tiny fraction of the time, who wouldn’t be compelled to give it a try? Gibala wanted to test how efficient and effective a 10-minute workout could be, compared with the standard 50-minutes-at-a-time approach. The micro-workout he devised consists of three exhausting 20-second bouts of all-out, hard-as-you-can exercise, followed by brief recoveries. In a three-month study, he pitted the short workout against the standard one to see which was better. To his amazement, the workouts resulted in identical improvements in heart function and blood-sugar control, even though one workout was five times longer than the other. “If you’re willing and able to push hard, you can get away with surprisingly little exercise,” Gibala says. Not everyone can–or wants to–do this kind of excruciating workout, often referred to as high-intensity interval training, or HIIT. Many of us would gladly bounce around in Zumba class for an hour to avoid enduring even a minute of HIIT torture. But considering that a lack of time is the No. 1 reason people say they don’t exercise, a workout far shorter than what’s generally recommended could be a strong motivator. Gibala, for his part, is wondering if the workout can get even shorter. He’s even played around with the idea of a one-minute workout. Not every type of exercise will work for every person, of course, but a growing body of research indicates that very vigorous exercise–like the interval workouts Gibala is studying–is, in fact, appropriate for people with different chronic conditions, from Type 2 diabetes to heart failure. That’s new thinking, because for decades, people with certain diseases and even pregnant women were advised not to exercise. Now scientists know that far more people can and should exercise. A recent analysis of more than 300 clinical trials discovered that for people recovering from a stroke, for instance, exercise was even more effective at helping them rehabilitate. Dr. Robert Sallis, a family physician who runs a sports-medicine fellowship at Kaiser Permanente Fontana Medical Center in California, has prescribed exercise to his patients since the early 1990s in hopes of doling out less medication. “It really worked amazingly, particularly in my very sickest patients,” he says. “If I could get them to do it on a regular basis–even just walking, anything that got their heart rate up a bit–I would see dramatic improvements in their chronic disease, not to mention all of these other things like depression, anxiety, mood and energy levels.” Older people, too, can benefit from strenuous exercise. Until now, all the recommendations for increasing bone density have included low-repetition, high-weight types of training, says Jinger Gottschall, associate professor of kinesiology at Penn State University. “But this just isn’t feasible for a lot of people. You can’t picture your grandma going in and doing that.” Luckily for Grandma, Gottschall’s team found that lifting lighter weights for more reps improves bone density in key parts of the body, making it a good alternative to heavy lifting. It’s becoming evident that nearly everyone–young, old, pregnant, ill–benefits from exercise. And as scientists learn more about why that is, they’re hoping that those early 20th century missteps–the move away from our being bodies in motion–will be reversed. They’re also hoping that the messaging around exercise gets simpler. “People think now, because of the health-club and fitness movement, that in order to exercise you need to join a fancy club and wear fancy clothes,” says Berryman. In fact, some of the best exercise, research is showing, doesn’t require a gym membership at all. Back at McMaster University, Tarnopolsky and his team are almost finished doing autopsies on mice from their new study, and even though the scalpel-wielding scientists are blind to which groups the mice were in, they can tell with certainty which animals were allowed to exercise and which were sedentary. “You open up the sedentary mice and there’s fat all over the place,” he says. About half of those mice have tumors. “They just look god-awful.” As for the mice who hit the wheel every day? “We haven’t found a single tumor,” he says. “I think if people saw, they’d be pretty motivated to exercise.” Write to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/wellness-mags/"], "sentiment_score": 0.13643431725084956, "subjectivity_score": 0.46077114865421287},

They protect your health as much as quitting smoking and a great deal more than exercising, according to a large 2010 review in the journal PLOS One. More research has shown that socially isolated people are more than twice as likely to die from heart disease as those with a solid social circle. “Strong social relationships support mental health, and that ties into better immune function, reduced stress and less cardiovascular activation,” says Dr. Debra Umberson, a sociologist at the University of Texas, Austin. Umberson says emotional support is just one of a dozen ways friends may safeguard your health and extend your life. MORE Here’s How Hugs Can Prevent the Flu Unfortunately, though, many of us don’t have enough of them. According to data from the General Social Survey (GSS), the number of Americans who say they have no close friends has roughly tripled in recent decades. “Zero” is also the most common response when people are asked how many confidants they have, the GSS data show. And adult men seem to be especially bad at keeping and cultivating friendships. That may seem strange in the era of Facebook, Twitter and boundless digital connectivity. But the “friends” orbiting at the farthest reaches of your digital galaxy aren’t the ones that matter when it comes to your health and happiness. The vital friendships—the pals you hug and laugh and lament with—are the ones who have the greatest impact on your health and happiness. You need between three and five of them for optimal wellbeing, suggests research from Dr. Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Oxford. Dunbar’s name comes up a lot when you start digging into the subject of friendship. From his early work studying the brains and social circles of primates, he recognized that the size of a human’s social network might be limited by the size of a certain part of the human brain called the neocortex, a critical site for higher brain functions. After some complicated study, he came up with a figure now known as “Dunbar’s number.” That number—usually cited as 150, but actually a range between 100 and 200—is the approximate size of a person’s social circle, or the perpetually changing group of friends and family members that you would invite to a large party. While you may have far fewer than 150 of these people in your life, your brain really can’t hold a close connection with more than 150, Dunbar’s research shows. Within that group, he says your closest 15 relationships—including family members or “kin”—seem to be most crucial when it comes to your mental and physical health. But that’s not to say a brother or sister offers you the same benefits as a close friend, Dunbar says. While your kin are more likely to be there for you when you need help, your good friends tend to fire up your nervous system and trigger the release of feel-good neuropeptides called endorphins. Whether you’re laughing with your pal or feeling him or her touch your shoulder in sympathy, the resulting rush of endorphins seems to “tune” up your immune system, protecting you from disease, Dunbar explains. So yes, for the sake of your health, you need friends—ideally the really close kind you see face-to-face on a regular basis. But even one very good friend can improve your life in profound ways, says Dr. Mark Vernon, a philosopher, psychotherapist and author of The Meaning of Friendship. Despite their value in terms of your health and wellbeing, don’t think of them as your personal social doctors. Vernon warns against turning your friends into what he calls “service providers”—that’s not what friendship should be about, he says, even if your pals are good for you. In the end, Vernon says Ralph Waldo Emerson may have offered the best advice when it comes to making and keeping close pals: “The only way to have a friend is to be one.” Read next: 5 Types of Friends That Everyone Has Listen to the most important stories of the day.

Having a partner during middle age, which is when chronic diseases often first appear, is protective against premature death, according to a 2013 study that Martin and his co-authors published in Annals of Behavioral Medicine. They also found that people who never married were more than twice as likely to die early as people in stable marriages. “Being married is a big factor in survivorship,” Martin concluded. Martin’s team isn’t the first to make the connection between marriage and longer life. A 2013 study of 15,330 cardiac events showed that married people have considerably better prognoses than singles. The effect has been observed beyond heart-disease patients. Other research indicates that married people are more likely to have their cancer detected early and less likely to die early from it. Longevity researchers believe it’s tied to the live-in emotional and physical support. When you have someone around all the time, it means you have someone to remind you to take your meds and go to the doctor. And if you fall down or otherwise hurt yourself, there’s a good chance there will be someone around to help you. Married people are also more likely to adopt healthy behaviors like exercising and quitting smoking if their partner does. Martin, who interviews centenarians, says he’s heard many of them say they abide by healthy behaviors their long-deceased spouse used to remind them about. “Some of the marriage benefits seem to outlast the partner who doesn’t make it to very old age,” he says. The so-called marriage effect doesn’t appear to benefit men and women equally, however. The Terman Life-Cycle Study–an ongoing project that started following more than 1,500 people in 1921–found that whereas steadily married men were likely to live substantially longer than divorced or remarried men, divorced women lived almost as long as their married peers. “Women who thrived in a good marriage stayed especially healthy,” explains Howard S. Friedman, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, and author of The Longevity Project, which breaks down and continues to build on the Terman research. “But women who stayed single, got and stayed divorced or were widowed often lived quite long without the burdens of husband trouble. They had good friends instead.” (Plenty of research shows that whether people are married or not, strong social connections and friendship are especially important factors in healthy aging.) Researchers are also learning that the quality of the marriage might matter–a lot. The husband-and-wife research duo Janice Kiecolt-Glaser and Ronald Glaser have conducted a number of experiments at Ohio State University on the topic. In one, they brought couples into their lab, inserted IV blood-collection catheters and then asked them to talk through an especially troublesome aspect of their marriage–things like finances, sex or their in-laws. They found that couples who are hostile toward each other tend to have more stress hormones in their blood, less adaptive immune systems and slower metabolic rates after eating high-fat meals. “The way people treat each other on a daily basis clearly impacts physical health,” says Kiecolt-Glaser. Poor marital quality and the stress associated with it are linked to differences in inflammation, a marker for disease, she adds. “That’s a great pathway to all the nastiness that comes with aging.” Even the best-case scenario of a happy and long marriage can come with a sad, if darkly romantic, twist: couples who die in old age within days or months of each other. While it’s not completely understood, experts suggest that broken-heart syndrome could be to blame. Broken-heart syndrome–a colloquial name for something called stress-induced cardiomyopathy–can be caused by an emotionally stressful event like the death of a loved one or even a very tough breakup. It’s often mistaken for a heart attack, but instead of blocked arteries, the culprit is a tsunami of stress hormones that cause the heart to temporarily expand, limiting its ability to pump. Still, it’s probably a risk most lovebirds are willing to take for a satisfying relationship–and a longer life.

Being lonely, however, is a whole different matter. Not only does it feel terrible, it can also harm your health. Here are five ways loneliness can be dangerous. —Elevated cortisol: Loneliness can cause stress, which your body interprets as danger. In response, it releases the hormone cortisol, explains Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University. In occasional bursts, cortisol gins up your cardiovascular and immune systems, up-regulates your metabolism and more. That’s fine intermittently, but chronically elevated cortisol can dysregulate those same systems, contributing to heart disease, diabetes, cancer and more. —Chronic inflammation: We tend think of inflammation as the overheated, reddened skin around a bite or a wound. That’s part of the inflammatory process, but so is a more systemic release of blood proteins that prep the immune system to deal with danger or injury. As with cortisol, loneliness-related stress can cause inflammation to become chronic, says Dr. Robert Waldinger, director of Harvard University’s Adult Development Survey. And as with elevated cortisol, that can lead to a host of diseases. —Poor diet: Not everyone who spends a lot of time alone eats a pint of ice cream straight from the container and calls it dinner. But people who live together are likelier to cook together or go out to for meals together — and to put more thought into what they eat, too. Choosing and preparing your meals carefully is less likely when you’re alone and lonely — as many studies, including  one in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, have shown — especially if you’re trying to medicate sadness or depression with food. —Too much booze: There are few things that are better at preventing you from pouring yourself just one more than having someone around to ask you if you really need one more. It’s far too much to say that loneliness drives people to drink, but people are likelier to practice moderation in all things when they’re accountable to someone else. As with food, if loneliness leads to depression, excess drinking can be a quick but dangerous route to trying to feel better. This is especially so among people who are middle-aged and older, according to a 2016 study in the Journal of Aging and Health. —Too little exercise: Life on the couch binge-watching TV can look awfully tempting when there’s little else to keep you engaged. But it’s a bad go-to when the loneliness is constant. Holt-Lunstad says that exercise is one of the most effective ways to address loneliness-related gloom. Even a brisk walk can make a significant difference — not least because it puts you in the company of other people.

That’s the message of the latest study published in the journal Diabetologia, which showed that parsing physical activity into short bouts of intense exercise is better than working out once a day. If snacking throughout the day is one way to keep your weight in check (as long as you don’t go overboard and stick to healthy ones), why not exercise snack too? The trial was small but provides some encouraging ways to make exercise more efficient. And who doesn’t want to learn how to stay trim by trimming the time spent at the gym? MORE: Even Brief Exercise Can Improve Memory In Older Adults All of the participants were just beginning to show signs of insulin resistance, one of the first steps toward diabetes, in which the body’s insulin starts to lose the battle in breaking down sugar from the diet. On three different days, each was asked to exercise in three different ways before eating breakfast, lunch and dinner, and their blood sugar was measured after each meal on the day they exercised and the following day. Spikes in blood sugar are normal after meals, but sustained peaks mean the body isn’t dispatching the sugar as quickly as it should; the result could be obesity and diabetes. Exercise snacking before eating — or exercising for just one minute at an intense enough level to push their hearts to 90% of their maximum beating rates — dropped blood sugar among the men and women after breakfast and dinner by more than a single session of 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise (in which the heart reached 60% of its maximum beating rate). Even more encouraging, their blood sugar remained lower for at least 24 hours. MORE: Extreme Workouts: When Exercise Does More Harm than Good The idea of breaking up exercise makes sense; recent studies showed, for example, that even people who meet the recommended daily 30 minutes of moderate physical activity still spend most of the remaining minutes of the day relatively inactive. And intense activity, especially before meals, may be key to kicking the body’s fat- and sugar-burning mechanisms into functioning at their best. The research does leave some questions unanswered, including how cumulative the effect of the short sessions are, whether the same effect holds for people who aren’t yet insulin resistant, and why the exercise snacks didn’t work as well before lunch. But the possibility that packaging exercise into smaller, and better timed sessions is certainly appealing, and will be the subject or more studies to come. Here’s hoping that intense, one minute exercise sessions are the wave of the future.

The Stanford University researchers looked at NHANES data over the last 20 years, and found that the number of U.S. women who reported doing no physical activity went from 19.1% in 1994 to 51.7% in 2010. For men, the number increased from 11.4% in 1994 to 43.5% in 2010. During the same time frame, the average BMI of men and women also went up. “At the population level, we found a significant association between the level of leisure-time physical activity, but not daily caloric intake, and the increases in both BMI and waist circumference,” said lead study author Dr. Uri Ladabaum, an associate professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine in a statement. The drop in physical activity is worrying, but it’s worth taking a closer look at the reseach. The dataset in this study did not show that Americans were consuming more calories over the 20 year period—but it should be noted that USDA data shows that Americans are consuming about 500 calories per day more than they did in the 1970 and 800 calories more than Americans in the 1950s. It’s certainly true that Americans are more sedentary than they used to be, but when it comes down to it, calories are a major component when it comes to weight gain. And though the researchers report that calorie intake hardly changed, they did not look at the makeup of the participants’ diets. Therefore, they have no idea where people were getting their calories—home cooked meals, fast food, processed food? It’s true that we’ve started relying too much on calories, and the simple advice of eat less exercise more isn’t always the answer. Well-respected researchers in the nutrition community argue what’s more important is avoiding the refined carbohydrates like white bread and sugary processed foods which have become staples in our diets. Instead, we should focus on better food quality, and of course, getting more physical activity. The obesity epidemic is caused by many factors, and it’s solution will have to incorporate many different strategies. At this point, we know that, and pulling out one cause ultimately isn’t productive—or accurate. What we should take away from this new study is that Americans are moving less and less—and that’s bad news.

But it turns out there’s another hidden cancer contributor that occupies much of our daily lives: sitting. In a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, researchers report that people who spend more hours of the day sitting have up to a 66% higher risk of developing certain types of cancer than those who aren’t as sedentary. MORE: Get Up! Sitting Less Can Add Years to Your Life These results go beyond the advice by most health professionals for everyone to become more physically active. In reviewing 43 studies in which volunteers were asked about their daily activities and their cancer incidence, the investigators found that the link between sitting and cancer remained strong no matter how physically active the participants were. In other words, even people who worked out regularly but who spent more hours on the couch watching TV, for instance, showed higher rates of cancer than those who didn’t sit as much. Sedentary behavior was associated with a 24% greater risk of developing colon cancer, a 32% higher risk of endometrial cancer, and a 21% increased risk of lung cancer. When the researchers delved deeper into different types of sedentary habits, they found that watching TV was linked to a 54% higher risk of colon cancer and a 66% greater risk of endometrial cancer. For every additional two hours that participants spent sitting during the day, their risk of colon cancer rose by 8%, and their risk of endometrial cancer went up by 10%. They didn’t find a link between sedentary behavior and other types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The findings, says Dr. Graham Colditz, of Washington University School of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, highlight the difference between being physically active and being sedentary. It’s not enough to just be active—it’s also important to sit less. But most public health messages aren’t stressing the distinction. “People are not talking about sitting time in the same way as physical activity,” he says. “Guidelines say limit the time spent sitting without drilling into how long or what types of sitting they are talking about.” MORE: Now There’s Another Reason Sitting Will Kill You The difference is important, especially since the latest research suggests that sitting too much may have its own, independent harms on our health. A recent study, for example, found that people who got up and did light to moderate walking after lunch had lower blood sugar levels and less of a peak in blood sugar than people who didn’t get up after eating. Part of sitting’s adverse effects, especially on endometrial cancer, which is strongly tied to obesity, may be through weight gain. Obesity can promote cancer-causing processes such as inflammation and may enhance certain hormones that are linked to tumor formation. Weight gain can also lead to lower levels of vitamin D, and that can contribute to higher risk of colon cancer. The authors also point out that TV viewing in particular may be associated with higher rates of certain cancers since TV watchers tend to drink more sugared sodas and unhealthy, processed snack foods that can both contribute to obesity and increase exposure to potential food-based cancer-causing agents. MORE: Watching TV: Even Worse for Kids Than You Think Cutting back on sitting time may not be easy, however, since most office workers tend to sit at a desk in front of computers. But Colditz says there are ways to be less sedentary, either at home or at the office. Try to take breaks every couple of hours, to take a quick walk around the halls or to step outside (bathroom breaks don’t count). And not eating lunch at your desk can also be a way to schedule a physical break in your day. What you don’t want to do, he says, is to make a habit of sitting (in a car or bus or train) to work, sitting at your desk for most of the day, eating lunch at your desk (again, while sitting), and then finally getting up to go home, where you may spend several more hours sitting in front of a TV.

All of the fun ways to sweat can help you get the government-recommended 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week, like swimming, volleyball, brisk walking—anything that speeds up your blood flow and breath. Less appealing is the other, more neglected kind: strength-training. While about half of Americans meet the goals for aerobic exercise, only 20% do the recommended muscle-strengthening activities that work major muscle groups. Women, especially, tend to shy away from it. But they neglect it at their own peril. Strength-training significantly lowers the risk for type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, finds a new study published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. Scientists (and anyone else who’s ever pumped some iron) have long known that strength training makes muscles bigger. It also protects bones by increasing their density, an important perk for aging women. But more recent evidence shows that it also reduces BMI, which improves how the body uses insulin. A bigger muscle also means that glucose can get around the body better. The researchers wanted to see if the lesser-known benefits of strength training, like these, actually influence a person’s risk of type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Using data from the Women’s Health Study, they followed nearly 36,000 older women who ranged in age from 47-98. The women filled out questionnaires yearly from 2000-2014 about their health and exercise levels, and one question asked women to estimate how much weight lifting/strength training they’d done per week in the past year. The researchers tracked which of the women got cardiovascular disease—including events like heart attack and stroke—and type-2 diabetes. Whether a woman did these muscle-strengthening exercises or not predicted much about her health. “Women who reported participating in any amount of strength training were more likely to have a lower BMI, more likely to engage in healthy dietary patterns, and less likely to be a current smoker,” compared with women who avoided it, the authors write. Strength training was also linked to a woman’s risk for the two conditions. Those who said they did any amount of strength training had a type-2 diabetes risk 30% lower and a cardiovascular disease risk 17% lower than those who did none, even after the researchers controlled for other variables like age, vegetable and fruit intake and physical activity. Not surprisingly, adding in aerobic exercise helped drive both risks down even more. Those who did at least 120 minutes a week of aerobic exercise and some strength training had a type-2 diabetes risk 65% lower than women who didn’t do either. More research is needed to determine the optimum amount of strength training for women and men to reduce their risks. But the study suggests that both kinds of exercise impart unique benefits—and that strength training has some serious scientific weight to it.

New research published in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health reports that prolonged sitting puts people over 60 at a risk for disabilities. Elderly adults in this age group spend on average two-thirds of their days sedentary, which equates to about nine hours a day. The link between age and disability held even when researchers controlled for obesity, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and other health factors. Here are some of the reasons not getting out of your chair can do you in. 1. Disabilities are more common among sedentary people: Researchers of the new study found that for every hour spent sedentary among people aged 60 and older was linked to a 50% greater chance of being disabled. 2. Sitting too long makes us overweight: People with more sedentary jobs are more likely to be overweight than people who sit less. Research suggests that since more jobs require people to sit at a desk, Americans are burning 120 to 140 less calories a day than they did 50 years ago. 3. You’re more likely to have a heart attack: Researchers studied the lifestyles and behaviors of more than 17,000 men and women over 13 years and discovered people who sit for the majority of their day have a 54% greater risk of dying from a heart attack. 4. It impacts your mental health: Women who reported more sitting outside of work in a 2012 survey also reported poorer mental health. 5. You’re at a greater risk for chronic disease: A survey of 63,048 Australian men found that men who sat for more than four hours a day were much more likely to suffer chronic ailments like heart disease and diabetes than men who sat for fewer. 6. Life expectancy is shorter: A 2011 study found that every hour of TV people watched after age 25 was linked to a deduction of 22 minutes from their overall life expectancy. 7. There’s a greater risk for kidney disease: A 2012 report found that people who sat less had a lower risk of kidney disease. The finding was especially prominent among women, who had a 30% lower risk of chronic kidney disease if they sat for only three hours during the work day. 8. Your risk of dying from colorectal cancer is greater: A 2013 study found that people with colorectal cancer who spent more of their free time sitting had a greater risk of dying from the disease.

We drive or sit on trains to get to work, and once we’re there, we’re glued to our chairs until we get home — where another round of sitting commences. All of that sedentary behavior is contributing to obesity and some of the chronic problems associated with excess weight. But can sitting less really help our health? To find out, Danish and Australian researchers went to 19 offices in Denmark — a country where all office workers have sit-stand desks (yet most don’t use the stand option). They randomly assigned 317 people to either get more encouragement to incorporate more standing during their day or to receive no additional education about the benefits of sitting less.

Too many cycles of dividing can trigger the aging process, until eventually the cell peters out and stops dividing altogether. But now researchers have found that exercise can help keep DNA healthy and young. In a small study published in the journal Science Advances, Anabelle Decottignies, from the de Duve Institute at the Catholic University of Louvain in Brussels, and her colleagues found that just moderate-intensity physical activity helps hold back cell aging. They studied a specific part of DNA that keeps track of how many times a cell has divided. Each time a cell divides, it copies its DNA (which is packed into chromosomes) and this section of the chromosomes, called telomeres, gets shorter. In the study, Decottignies identified a molecule that’s responsible for directing this telomere-shortening. Until this work, not much was known about how the chromosomes controlled this DNA snipping process. Decottignies recruited 10 healthy people to ride stationary bicycles for 45 minutes and took a muscle biopsy from each of their legs before and after the cycling session. She also measured blood levels of muscle function with lactate, which muscle cells produce when stressed. Based on analysis of these samples, the researchers found that a compound called nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) regulates the production of a factor that in turn controls the shortening of the telomeres. Exercise boosts levels of NRF1, which protects the telomeres from being snipped away. “Think about NRF1 like varnish on nails,” says Decottignies. “You cannot change the nail, but you can change the varnish again and again. What you’re doing is refreshing and replacing the old section with new protective molecules at the telomeres.” With each bout of moderate exercise, she says, the protection to the telomeres is refreshed, thus helping the DNA, and in turn the cells, to remain “younger” and hold off the aging process. “The protection is constantly renewed upon exercise,” says Decottignies. Other evidence supports the connection between exercise and its effect on telomeres. NRF1 is also part of the pathway that’s activated during starvation; some studies have indeed hinted that a fasting diet may help cells stay biologically young and not divide as frequently. In the study, the team didn’t actually measure whether the 45 minutes led to longer telomeres, but that’s a focus of future studies. For now, the findings provide strong support for a way that exercise may keep us young by keeping our DNA young.

{"type": "article", "header": "Sitting and Exercise: How Much Do You Need", "author": null, "update_date/publish_date": null, "link_to_article": "https://time.com/sitting/", "text": "   By Alice Park | Sept. 2, 2014\nIllustration by Robin Davey for TIME    You’ve already heard that sitting is the new smoking. Now, scientists reveal exactly how it hurts the body—and novel ways to undo the damage (without clocking hours at the gym). You might want to stand up for this. We like to think we’re a stand-up species. After all, that’s what drove our evolutionary march away from many of our four-legged ancestors. But everywhere we go are invitations to sit down. Hop into your car and what’s there? If you’re lucky, a plush bucket seat designed with just the right tilt for your back. On the subway to work? A less comfortable seat, to be sure, but you’ll grab one if you can. Once at work, an office chair. At home, your favorite fauteuil. But all that hospitality, all those opportunities to give your feet a break, are doing untold things to the rest of your body. From standing desks and fitness trackers to groundbreaking pilot experiments in high schools in several cities, the movement to sit less and stand more is gaining momentum. Which is a good thing, because new evidence suggests that the more than eight hours the average American spends sitting every day could be exacting a serious—and previously misunderstood—toll. In the latest look at the benefits of getting on the move — and the dangers of sitting still — researchers found that an hour of moderate activity, such as brisk walking, can offset the harms that sitting for eight hours can have. And there is also data showing that exercise benefits aren’t just for middle-aged and older people but for younger people as well. Andrea Chomistek from Indiana University and her colleagues found in a study published in Circulation that women aged 27 to 44 years old who were more physically active lowered their risk of heart disease over nearly 20 years by 25% compared to women who didn’t exercise. The results bring the dangers of inactivity to a relatively new group — younger women — who normally aren’t at high risk of things like heart disease or diabetes. It wasn’t how often the women exercised that mattered, but the fact that they did; any activity, including brisk walking, was beneficial. Studies have long connected sedentary behavior to poor health, including heart disease, diabetes, obesity and hypertension. But doctors thought those problems could be traced to the fact that people who sat more were probably just not working out very much. The public health messages were in step with that thinking. “Let’s Move!” became a national mantra. But while exercise is critical, it alone can’t make up for the ills of idleness. New research shows there’s a big difference between exercising too little and sitting too much. That’s because a standing body uses energy altogether differently from a sedentary body—and also from an exercising one. We burn calories at a different rate, store them in different ways, and our brains function differently, too. While data is still emerging, one experiment with high school kids found that standing in class instead of sitting improved their test scores by 20%. All of which has doctors and health experts calling for a paradigm shift. “In the same way that standing up is an oddity now, sitting down should be,” says Dr. James Levine, director of the Mayo Clinic-Arizona State University Obesity Solutions Initiative and probably best known as the inventor of the first treadmill desk. “My argument is that whatever building it is—a movie theater, airport, arts complex—a fundamental part of our thinking has become that people who enter that space will need to be seated.” And that’s what got us into all this trouble in the first place. This Is Your Body On Sitting It’s not entirely our fault. As we moved from an active, agricultural lifestyle to one of offices and automated transport, every aspect of our day, from our meals to our jobs and our entertainment, have been adapted with one priority in mind: our comfort. Where our ancestors spent the large bulk of their waking hours on the go, modern life entails sitting for as much as half the day (and that’s not counting sleeping). The first studies to connect sedentary behavior to poor health emerged in recent decades when scientists started to confirm, in a reproducible way, the effect that extra pounds can have on the body. In these large analyses of men and women of nearly every age, the message was clear: People who spent more hours of the day sitting were more likely to develop a host of health problems. A closer look at that data showed that swapping an hour on the couch for an hour playing catch wouldn’t cut it. A recent review of 43 studies analyzing daily activity and cancer rates found that people who reported sitting for more hours of the day had a 24% greater risk of developing colon cancer, a 32% higher risk of endometrial cancer and a 21% higher risk of lung cancer—regardless of how much they exercised. In another study involving a group of men and women who reported exercising the same amount, each additional hour they spent sitting was linked to a drop in their fitness levels. In other words, sitting was chipping away at some of the benefits of exercise. That’s an important realization. The human body consumes energy in three main ways: every cell needs energy to go about its daily business, whether it’s a muscle cell that contracts and flexes or a liver cell that produces enzymes; we also need to break down the food that we eat; finally, we need energy to move, whether we’re pulling on a shirt or riding a bike. That latter energy—let’s call it activity energy—is further divided into the sweat-inducing kind that you use on the treadmill or in yoga and another kind, which scientists have cleverly called NEAT: non-exercise activity thermogenesis. This includes nearly everything you do requiring movement: folding the laundry, walking up a flight of stairs, running to catch a train, even fidgeting. The human body is designed to move, and a moving body is a needy body, siphoning off calories to make sure every cell is doing what it’s supposed to do. But even when we’re not exercising, we’re moving and using energy. That’s why NEAT matters. A body that’s sitting isn’t expending energy, so the signals that normally result in you moving—and which, in turn, burn calories—start to check out, molecularly bored with not being called into duty. Meanwhile, the processes that build up fat get busier. When that happens, it gets harder and harder to get off the chair. The other signals that keep us rooted on our rears may originate in the brain. In animal studies, obese rats seemed to have a switch that prevented them from burning NEAT calories efficiently. The reason why isn’t clear yet, but researchers are studying the brain signals that govern what makes us more likely to move—or not move—to answer it. That could help explain, at least in part, why too much sitting seems to be so bad for the human body. People who sit at their desks most of the time, for example, only polish off 300 NEAT calories a day compared to, say, a coffee shop barista who spends most of his or her shift standing—and burning up to 1,300 extra calories daily. There’s also intriguing evidence that sitting less may short-circuit some bodily processes that lead to diabetes. When we eat meals, our bodies experience a surge in blood sugar that peaks about an hour after we eat. If we’re sedentary and relatively immobile, our muscles and cells aren’t soaking up that glucose to fuel its daily activities. So all that extra sugar gets turned into fat. If we take a walk after lunch, however, some of that sugar is burned off in order to keep us on our feet and propel us forward. The less sugar that’s left after that activity, the less that gets turned into fat and contributes to obesity and eventually diabetes. Becoming a body in motion Even if you’re wired in some ways to sit, can you become a stand-up person? Absolutely, says Levine. Just as sedentary behavior can change the brain and body to prefer sitting, getting up and becoming more active will prompt you to want to stay in motion. And that can have benefits on productivity and possibly creativity as well, although while the data on the harms of sitting are pretty well documented, the productivity benefits are still anecdotal. But researchers, including Levine, are working on that. In Rochester, Minn., for example, Levine conducted an experiment with the help of Apple, which donated computers and other supplies, on a School of the Future concept that rethought the classroom model of kids sitting at attention. Instead, the kids stood and moved. Levine and his team strapped sensors to the legs and backs of students to measure their NEAT levels. The students had mobile stations that held their laptops, which they could move around the classroom. Benches let the kids sit when the wanted to, but the default was clearly toward standing and moving. After two months, the teachers reported that the students took fewer bathroom breaks, engaged in less frivolous movement, and related better to each other. Parents also noticed a difference. They said, almost unbelievable, that their children came home more eager to do homework and less stressed after their day. And what did the NEAT sensors show? The children doubled their activity level compared to when they were in a traditional classroom. Finally, the pioneering students scored up to 20% higher on state standardized tests than they had previously. Even if you don’t have the help of Apple or a forward-thinking boss to transform your workplace, there are ways to make yourself get up. For the more ambitious, there’s changing your work station to a standing one (see how one TIME staffer did the same by reading this story). But even simply fielding phone calls on your feet is a good way to start, or pacing while you talk. You could also keep a small glass of water on your desk so you’re inclined to get up more frequently to refill it, taking walks around the office or your home while you’re at it. For the more ambitious, says Levine, urge your colleagues to try standing meetings. “By simply changing your work style, from a chair-based work style to a [standing] one, you can burn 500 to 1,000 extra calories a day,” he says. And it’s not just the calories that count. One study found that regardless of how many hours a group of men spent sitting daily (in their cars or watching TV), those with higher fitness levels – which is, of course, a product of regular exercise – did not show an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, the suite of conditions that include obesity and high cholesterol and are associated with a higher risk of heart disease. How do you turn your sitting day into a standing one? In 2000, Levine addressed the office chair culture head on when he and a colleague raided the Mayo Clinic basement, where old and broken furniture was stored, and with some duct tape and a saw, put together a patient table that could be adjusted for height with a Sears treadmill to make the first treadmill desk. After some number crunching, he figured out that the optimal speed for writing and walking was about 1 mph, so he adjusted the speed of his contraption to keep his fingers and feet moving without falling off the device. Now, there are far fancier versions of the treadmill desk that allow you to switch between desk and full treadmill mode (minus the duct tape). And they’re becoming less of an oddity. “What we need to do is change the default,” Levine says. “I want us to have to find excuses to be sitting down.” Imagine that. Maybe standing really could be the new sitting.  By Katy Steinmetz Sure, these contraptions can cost hundreds. But they don’t have to\n If I personally shut down all the hoodie factories in the world, so long as I did it standing up, that would probably be more acceptable in the Bay Area than the fact that until recently, I spent all day sitting. Earlier this year, I toured Silicon Valley to report on the borderline ridiculous things that tech companies are doing for their employees in the name of health. Free juice bars, giant two-person tricycles, on-site chiropractors. As HR administrators listed off the evils they must fight—stress, work-life imbalance, the draw of corn chips—I probably heard more than anything else about the perils of being on one’s behind for hours at a time. I was prepared for this assignment to make me feel like a schlub. Because I do not, for instance, meditate to reduce my stress, and I do not bike to work to stay fit. I don’t use vibrating forks to slow my eating speed. And I certainly don’t have a life coach (unless you count lyrics of Janet Jackson songs). But still, I was not prepared to have my chair-using habit held up as the paragon of bad health. That, and the fact that I was doing this terrible thing for roughly a third of my day, made me all the more determined to make a change when the reporting was done. At companies such as Google, there are tools employees can call upon to minimize their time spent sitting. There are motorized desks that can be adjusted to a standing height. There are treadmill desks on which employees can stroll while pecking at their laptops. There are ergonomics teams one can call in like a SWAT unit to measure all their body parts to make sure the employee is standing as comfortably as possible. Such is not the case in my San Francisco office, where the average everyday perk is somewhere between all the AAA batteries I could ever want and a very reliable elevator. I didn’t know quite where to start. I wasn’t going to call up my boss and ask if I could expense a $300 desk accessory that would elevate my laptop, and I certainly wasn’t going to inquire about the $1,500 LifeSpan TR1200 treadmill desk—because I would, rightly, be laughed out of print media. So I went foraging in the office space. First, I tried putting a chair on my desk, where I would defiantly place my computer in a poetic statement about my refusal to use such office furniture in the conventional way any longer. It was too tall. I tried old boxes, which proved insufficiently sturdy and a giant roll of bubble wrap, which proved very noisy. After attempting to build towers out of differently sized books and old magazines, my eyes finally landed on the glorious solution, sitting there in front of me the whole time: trash cans. I discovered that two upside-down standard-sized cans were just right for my 15” laptop and my 5’3” frame. To create a sturdy top, I placed an office-warming gift—a framed poster of the state of California—on top. I rolled my office chair into a corner and voila: I had the ugliest low-budget standing desk this side of Jerry Brown. My first surprise: No more shoes at work. I’m a lady and all, but I wasn’t going to stand for nine hours in the high heels that I have long worn to make my calves more presentable during daily trips to and from the local sandwich shop. Even barefoot, my feet got sore the first few days—and so I bought an anti-fatigue mat. (It’s worth investing in a decent one, like this Imprint number I got from Amazon for $56). A kind former colleague offered me her Time Inc. brand towel, a black and blue thing that hid my furniture’s true identity but made me look like a dork who decorates her office with on-brand towels. To get more suitable decoration, I took to the local tapestry shop in the Russian Hill neighborhood. In the basement, I dug through remnants of fabric cast off by other buyers and found a lovely gold and black piece that would do the job for $10. And with that my anti-backside experiment was ready to commence. The results came in quickly. I had more energy throughout the day. I didn’t get sleepy after lunch. My voice projected better on the phone. I could spontaneously break into dance with ease. I found myself taking more trips to the copy room and mailroom because, hey, I was already up, so why minimize my trips? And when I went home to binge-watch Orange Is the New Black, I didn’t feel so guilty for sitting in the evening. I was earning it. After the standing went on for a few weeks, I permanently rolled my chair out of the office, like a smoker who finally throws away the backup pack. And after a few months, my fiancé was the first to notice that my buns had gotten firmer and my quads were stronger. I had gone into the project knowing that standing just three hours per day for a year was the equivalent of running 10 marathons, but I hadn’t expected to see actual changes in my body so quickly. And so here I am, a true stander-and-worker. And I’m never going back.  Your browser is out of date.

And one kind in particular—aerobic exercise—appears to be king.  “Back in the day, the majority of exercise studies focused on the parts of the body from the neck down, like the heart and lungs,” says Ozioma Okonkwo, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. “But now we are finding that we need to go north, to the brain, to show the true benefits of a physically active lifestyle on an individual.”  Exercise might be a simple way for people to cut down their risk for memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease, even for those who are genetically at risk for the disease. In a June study published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, Okonkwo followed 93 adults who had at least one parent with Alzheimer’s disease, at least one gene linked to Alzheimer’s, or both. People in the study who spent at least 68 minutes a day doing moderate physical activity had better glucose metabolism—which signals a healthy brain—compared to people who did less. The brain benefits of exercise go beyond disease prevention. Okonkwo has also shown that people who exercise have greater brain volume in areas of the brain associated with reasoning and executive function. “We’ve done a series of studies showing that increased aerobic capacity boosts brain structure, function and cognition,” he says, “Other people have found exercise can improve mood.” Okonkwo’s research has also shown that exercise can diminish the impact of brain changes on cognition, not just prevent it. “Exercise is the full package,” he says. Exercise likely improves brain health through a variety of ways. It makes the heart beat faster, which increases blood flow to the brain. This blood delivers oxygen—a good thing, since the brain is the biggest consumer of oxygen in the body. Physical activity also increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is known to help repair and protect brain cells from degeneration as well as help grow new brain cells and neurons, says Okonkwo. In one study, Joe Northey, a PhD candidate at the University of Canberra Research Institute for Sport and Exercise in Australia, showed that when people ride a stationary bike, they experience increased blood flow to the brain, and within that blood are a range of growth factors that are responsible for cell growth and associated with improved brain function. “Considering exercise can also reduce the risks associated with common lifestyle diseases that impact the brain, such as high blood sugar and hypertension, it is further motivation to try to incorporate exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle,” says Northey. MORE: The Simple Reason Exercise Enhances Your Brain Aerobic exercise, like running and swimming, appears to be best for brain health. That’s because it increases a person’s heart rate, “which means the body pumps more blood to the brain,” says Okonkwo. But strength training, like weight lifting, may also bring benefits to the brain by increasing heart rate. The link between resistance training and better brain health is not as established, but research in the area is growing.  For now, Northey recommends a combination of the two. “Combining both is ideal,” he says, for all of the other benefits exercise bestows on the body. “In addition to improving your brain function, you should expect to see improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength, as well as reducing the risk of obesity, diabetes and hypertension amongst other diseases.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4752846/exercise-brain-health/", "https://time.com/4833348/exercise-genetic-risk-alzheimers-disease/?xid=newsletter-health/", "https://time.com/4833348/exercise-genetic-risk-alzheimers-disease/?xid=newsletter-health/", "http://time.com/4352177/exercise-benefits-brain-and-mood/", "http://time.com/4474874/exercise-fitness-workouts/", "http://time.com/4752846/exercise-brain-health/", "http://time.com/4825495/is-running-good-for-you/?iid=sr-link1", "http://time.com/4688623/swimming-pool-health-benefits/?iid=sr-link1", "http://time.com/4803697/bodybuilding-strength-training/?iid=sr-link1"], "sentiment_score": 0.15775631313131316, "subjectivity_score": 0.4495164141414142},

The best-known treatments at the top of the list–half a dozen antidepressants and known combinations of those drugs–are all crossed out. “My therapist says he’s never had this much difficulty with somebody,” says Hanley, “which is sort of a dubious honor.” Hanley is only 21 years old, but he’s already six years into his search for something, anything, that can help him feel better for more than a few weeks at a time. “I’ve heard people describe it as sadness, and that’s not specific enough,” he says. Numbness is closer, but it’s not like depression inures you to suffering. “It’s like not quite being alive,” he says, “but still having to go through all the crappy parts of being alive.” When he was in the 10th grade, Hanley basically lost all desire to get out of bed in the morning. He started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist–the same one he sees today–and went on Zoloft. “I wasn’t catatonic anymore,” he says. But the positive effects soon disappeared, like they would with every medication he’s tried since. This year, Hanley quit college and put on ice his ambitions to become a screenwriter. Now he spends most of his time waiting to start a new treatment, trying that new treatment or waiting to see if he feels better. Most diagnoses do not come with 20-plus medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat it–and yet with depression, more options don’t always mean better outcomes. Ever since the first antidepressants were introduced 60 years ago, doctors have had patients like Hanley–people who don’t seem to get better even after they’ve worked their way through the lengthy list of available drugs. About 30% of all people with depression don’t respond adequately to the available treatments. That’s a dismal failure rate for a class of drugs designed to improve a person’s basic ability to function. Not that it has hurt the market. At last count, about 12% of Americans took antidepressants. Global revenue for antidepressants was about $14.5 billion in 2014 and is projected to grow to nearly $17 billion over the next three years. Clinical depression affects 6.7% of U.S. adults, or about 16 million people, and a growing number of children and teenagers too. It’s the leading cause of disability in the world, costing the U.S. economy alone $210 billion a year in lost productivity, missed days of work and care for the many physical and mental illnesses related to depression, like anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, migraines and sleep disorders. There hasn’t been a major depression-drug breakthrough in nearly three decades, but a number of factors are conspiring to change that. Scientists are gaining a more nuanced picture of what depression is–not a monolithic disease, but probably dozens of distinct maladies–and they’re getting closer to learning what works for which kind of ailment. With suicides in the U.S. at their highest number in 30 years, experts agree that patients need faster ways to feel better, without waiting the typical four to eight weeks it takes for antidepressants to kick in. And as old drugs have gone off patent–making them less lucrative for drugmakers–companies are eager to find new revenue streams. The biggest development has been the rediscovery of a promising, yet fraught, drug called ketamine. It’s best known as a psychedelic club drug that makes people hallucinate, but it may also have the ability to ease depression–and fast. In a race to shape the next generation of antidepressants, Johnson & Johnson and Allergan are fast-tracking new medicines inspired by ketamine. The FDA could be reviewing new drug submissions by as early as next year. Researchers, too, are exploring how to harness big data and even genetic testing to come up with new ways of treating depression for the 30% of people who don’t respond to the current standard-of-care treatment options. All of this has psychiatrists, long frustrated with their menu of available treatments, hopeful for the first time in years. Finally, they say, their field is on the cusp of a much-needed breakthrough. “At this point, any new depression treatment that makes it to the finish line is a huge win,” says Dr. George Papakostas, director for treatment-resistant depression studies at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It’s going to have a major impact.” The question is, which method will prove to help the most people in the safest way possible? Doctors have always seen depression as something that’s distinct from ordinary sadness, but what causes it and how best to treat it has changed wildly over the years. In the 5th century B.C., Hippocrates believed the body was made up of four humors and that too much “black bile,” the humor secreted by the spleen, resulted in melancholia. Melancholia as described by the Greeks looked a lot like depression today: persistent dark moods with a deep, lasting fear or sadness that isn’t based on reason. The Greeks prescribed lifestyle treatments like diet, exercise, sleep, bathing and massage as well as rougher approaches like vomiting and bloodletting. In later ancient times, sex was also considered a helpful remedy. By the Middle Ages, depressive-like behavior was believed to be a disease of the spirit–the result of demonic possession. Many depressed women were thought to be witches, and the cure for them was to be burned alive. The idea that depression is rooted in the brain–and not a bodily fluid or possessed spirit–didn’t take hold until the 17th century, when a neurologist named Thomas Willis decreed that melancholia was “a complicated Distemper of the Brain and Heart.” Although he had little else to offer patients besides the lifestyle remedies of the Greeks, melancholia was finally thought to be at least partly biological. In subsequent years, everything from herbal remedies to opium to music therapy to spinning stools designed to make people too dizzy to feel pain fell in and out of vogue. Beginning in 1938, electroconvulsive therapy was thought to be the only effective modern treatment for depression, but the procedure sometimes caused memory loss, among other side effects. It wasn’t until the 1950s that doctors hit upon the idea that certain chemical cocktails could be used to treat depression. The first, called iproniazid, was found by accident when it was being tested as a treatment for tuberculosis. Doctors noticed that the TB patients taking the drug transformed from miserable and near death to euphoric, energetic and social. Newspaper articles of people “dancing in the halls tho’ there were holes in their lungs” captured the popular imagination, and in 1957 scientists decided to try it on a small group of psychiatric patients. According to that study, 70% of them became happier and more social. By the end of the decade, about 400,000 people with depression were on the drug. The high was short-lived, however: scientists soon discovered that the pills caused liver damage, and it was pulled from the market in 1961. Another experimental drug, imipramine, was supposedly an antipsychotic, but scientists discovered in 1957 that it worked much better on people with depression. It became the first in a class of what’s called a tricyclic antidepressant, so named for its three-ringed chemical structure. By studying how those early drugs worked, scientists were able to hit on a new idea about what caused depression in the first place: depleted levels of the brain’s neurotransmitters, namely serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. Those early drugs may have come with nasty side effects, but they ultimately gave rise to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the drugs most widely prescribed today. Eli Lilly released the first one, Prozac, in 1987. It was an immediate hit; in just three years, 2 million people around the world were taking it, and pharmaceutical companies began churning out their own only slightly different versions of the drug soon after. SSRIs are still the field’s proudest and most profitable achievement, but they’re far from perfect. They can make people feel worse before they start feeling better several weeks after treatment begins. When the drugs work, they’re life-changing. But they don’t work for everyone. On SSRIs, about 35% of people taking them experience full remission. “We have no idea, after many decades of studying these drugs, why some people get better and some people don’t,” says Dr. Roy Perlis, director of the Center for Experimental Drugs and Diagnostics at Massachusetts General Hospital. “We desperately need truly new interventions.” The largest, longest study conducted on depression treatments, called the STAR*D trial, found that after people tried four antidepressants over the course of five years, about 70% of them were free of depressive symptoms. That’s a lot of trial and error to end at a place where 30% of patients don’t experience remission at all. The STAR*D trial ended in 2006, and despite a clear hole in the market–and a clear patient need–a golden age of new depression treatments still hasn’t arrived. Drug companies do not want to spend their money developing yet another SSRI–there are already a dozen approved by the FDA. “The drug companies basically shut down a lot of their brain research when it comes to psychiatry,” says Dr. Richard Friedman, director of the psychopharmacology clinic at Weill Cornell Medical College. “In my opinion, it wasn’t necessarily a lack of interest–it was just that people had felt that they’d gone as far as they could with things like Prozac, and they weren’t sure what the next targets were going to be,” says Husseini Manji, global head for neuroscience at Janssen, the pharmaceutical arm of Johnson & Johnson. Now, many experts–and drug companies–believe that target is ketamine hydrochloride, the only legally available psychedelic drug in the U.S. In large doses, anesthesiologists use ketamine to put people under before surgery. In smaller doses, clubgoers use “Special K” to trip and hallucinate; it’s one of the top drugs of abuse in Asia. However, its newest application, discovered serendipitously in the late 1990s, opened ketamine up to a whole new audience: those looking for a fast-acting drug for stubborn depression. There are two drugs, one from Allergan and one from Johnson & Johnson, that work similarly to ketamine and are in late-stage clinical trials. As of now, ketamine is not FDA-approved for depression. So far, clinical trials on ketamine for depression have been small, and there aren’t many of them. Only about 400 people have participated in such studies, and many had fewer than 100 people. (By comparison, the STAR*D trial had almost 3,000 participants.) Still, the results are promising enough to excite a number of prominent researchers in the field. “In the past 20 years, I’ve not seen anything like this,” says Dr. Cristina Cusin, a clinician and researcher who runs the ketamine clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital. Studies have shown that 60% to 70% of people with treatment-resistant depression respond to ketamine. Ketamine has also shown promise in putting an end to suicidal thoughts. “We have patients saying, ‘I’m exactly as depressed as I was before, I just don’t want to kill myself anymore,'” says Cusin. “This was very surprising. We can’t explain it.” Barbara Reiger, who’s 59 and lives in San Diego, says she tried nearly everything to lift her out of the depression that had plagued her since childhood and sometimes rendered her suicidal. When she learned about ketamine in 2015, she decided to try it at a ketamine clinic in her hometown. Since ketamine is FDA-approved as an anesthetic, physicians can legally prescribe it off-label for any condition they believe it may help, including depression. Since then, every six weeks or so, she shows up at a private ketamine clinic, where she’ll put on an eye mask in a dim room, sit back in a recliner and have a needle full of ketamine plunged into her deltoid. It doesn’t make her feel high, exactly, but she remembers that the first time she tried it, a grin and happy tears spread across her face. “I felt I was putting things in order, moving pieces of a puzzle around to make it all make sense,” she says. Ketamine trips are known to help people disconnect from their bodies and their thoughts, and it worked that way for Reiger. After her first trip, she remembers feeling better than she had for years. “I immediately felt relief … a lightness of the depression kind of lifting,” says Reiger. And it all happened in less than an hour. “It’s been a paradigm shift, that now we can achieve rapid antidepressant effects,” says Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of the experimental therapeutics and pathophysiology branch at the National Institute of Mental Health and one of the foremost researchers of ketamine. “Now we know there’s something radically different.” Experts aren’t sure exactly how ketamine works, although they agree it doesn’t target the standard antidepressant route of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. Instead, they think it stimulates a series of receptors in the brain, kick-starting something called synaptic plasticity–the ability of parts of the brain to grow and change. While antidepressants have been shown to also increase plasticity, ketamine seems to do it much more quickly–and much more powerfully. How it works is one of the drug’s many unknowns. Doctors also don’t know the consequences and potential side effects of taking tiny doses of ketamine over and over again. People can become dependent on it, and long-term use of the drug has been linked to bladder toxicity and cognitive problems in those who abuse it recreationally. And although ketamine has been shown to be safe as an anesthetic, “you get anesthesia once,” Cusin says. “You don’t get anesthesia for months or a year. We have no idea what it does.” Ketamine’s effects are temporary; depression reliably creeps back, so people need infusions every few weeks or more to keep their symptoms at bay. It’s also costly. The treatments are rarely covered by insurance and run from $400 to $800 per infusion. On a biweekly schedule at the high end of going rates, that adds up to more than $15,000 out of pocket per year. When Reiger first started taking ketamine, she quickly drained the funds she had set aside for treatments. She was on an every-six-weeks schedule, not including doctor’s visits, but at $500 a pop it was adding up fast. “It was cutting too much into our budget,” she says. She thought she’d have to stop treatment, but she got lucky: another of her doctor’s ketamine patients heard about her plight and volunteered to pay for her treatments. “I’m grateful,” Reiger says. “But a donor can only be so generous, and I know someday I’ll probably have to face these demons again.” As many as 5 million people in the U.S. have treatment-resistant depression, and to capture such a huge potential market, private ketamine clinics run by psychiatrists or anesthesiologists have popped up across the country in recent years. These clinics have pitched themselves to doctors as get-rich-quick side businesses and to patients as a ray of light in the darkness. But there are no rules governing how these clinics administer ketamine or whether they monitor blood pressure, heart rate, psychological changes or substance-abuse risk in patients who are taking it. “There is pretty large variability in what one clinic is doing compared to another,” says Dr. Gerard Sanacora, director of the Yale Depression Research Program at Yale School of Medicine and a longtime ketamine researcher, who surveyed 57 of these clinics in a July paper. This year, a task force from the American Psychiatric Association (APA) concluded in an issue of the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry that ketamine wasn’t ready to be widely used as a medication for treatment-resistant depression. “I still think it’s the most exciting treatment to come in mood disorders, probably of the last 50 years,” says Sanacora, who worked on the APA statement. “But the reality is, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the treatment.” Other scientists are skeptical that ketamine is a good long-term solution to depression. “I think a lot of the hope on ketamine may prove to be misplaced,” says Friedman, of Weill Cornell Medical College. “People may be disappointed.” One problem, he says, is that in addition to enhancing neuroplasticity, it may also stimulate an opioid receptor in the brain. “If you stimulate that receptor–which is what Percocet and oxycodone and morphine and heroin do–you’ll relieve pain and make people feel high and euphoric,” says Friedman. But that can also come with risk of habituation and abuse. Scientists already know that ketamine can be addictive. Now a clinical trial is under way at Stanford to test if ketamine acts like an opioid. Results are expected by the end of 2018. Until recently, ketamine proved to be a tough drug to imitate. Because it has widespread effects in the brain and doesn’t act neatly in just one spot, many of the drugs developed in its likeness–including those from pharma giants like AstraZeneca and Roche–were simply not as effective as the original. But now a few new drugs are showing promise. Last year, Zarate at the National Institute of Mental Health and his colleagues keyed in on a part of ketamine’s chemical structure that they think is responsible for the drug’s antidepressant effects. Now they’re working on developing it as a treatment for depression. Early research in mice suggests that, unlike ketamine, the compound they’ve identified does not appear to be addictive. Janssen, part of Johnson & Johnson, has developed and patented a version of ketamine called esketamine that doctors would be able to give their patients through the nose like a nasal decongestant, making it a more convenient alternative to an IV. The FDA has designated esketamine a “breakthrough therapy,” which means it can speed through the typically lengthy drug development process and get to market more quickly. If the ongoing efficacy trials prove successful, Janssen could file esketamine for FDA approval in 2018. Rapastinel, an intravenous depression drug under development by Allergan that acts on the same receptor as ketamine, can be given in just 30 seconds and doesn’t seem to cause the hallucinogenic effects ketamine is known for. “So far in our clinical trials, the incidence of anything like hallucinations or psychosis has been incredibly low,” says David Nicholson, chief R&D officer at Allergan. That drug also received breakthrough status by the FDA and is in the final phase of clinical trials, which are expected to finish in 2019. Once those trials are done, Allergan will petition the FDA for approval to market the drug for major depression. They’re also working on an oral version of rapastinel. Other new approaches to treating depression are on the horizon. For instance, researchers are testing drugs that target altogether different potential biological roots of depression–including chronic inflammation. And at Perlis’ lab at Massachusetts General Hospital, a team of scientists is trying to use big data to uncover whether any other existing FDA-approved medications–including drugs for completely different issues, like high cholesterol, pain and even acne–could have any mood-lifting side effects. Finding a medication that can be repurposed for depression would have huge advantages over traditional drug development: they are already proven to be safe, they don’t cost a fortune to create from scratch and they’re available for people to use now. A revolution in genetics also offers promise for treating depression. “After lots of years of really not going anywhere, suddenly there’s a lot to be excited about,” says Perlis. In a landmark 2016 study, he collaborated with the genetics company 23andMe and Pfizer Pharmaceuticals to analyze the genetic profiles of nearly 460,000 people. For the first time, they discovered 15 different regions of the human genome associated with the development of depression. Understanding what these depression genes do in the body makes it easier for scientists to find new drugs and interventions that have the opposite effect, which will make the search for treatments ever more precise. “It essentially gives us a target to aim at,” Perlis says. For those who are suffering without hope, these new innovations, whether they stem from ketamine or whatever compound scientists will stumble upon next, can’t come soon enough. For his part, Ian Hanley is waiting to see if ketamine, which he recently crossed off the list of treatments he has tried, will be a success or just another failure. His first IV infusion left him dazed and, after a long nap, uncharacteristically energetic. The night of his first trip, he shocked his parents by cleaning his room and going for a walk for the first time in ages. But about half of his subsequent treatments sent him on bad trips. He was consumed with worries that he’ll stay depressed, that ketamine won’t work for him and that, if it doesn’t, he won’t know what to do next. Hanley says ketamine has given him a bit of hope, but that hope is tempered by the skepticism of a patient who’s been excited–then crushed–many times before. Drug-free treatments backed by science MANY PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION FIND RELIEF WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION drugs. These methods have all been scientifically proven to help ease symptoms of depression. Here’s what the research recommends: EXERCISE One of the most-studied natural approaches to treating depression, regular physical activity may lift mood in part by increasing certain neurotransmitters. Of course, embracing an exercise habit isn’t easy for most people–especially those with depression. “In my experience, the last thing depressed people want to do is move,” says Dr. Andrew Weil, founder of the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine. “But it has a striking effect.” Plus, it’s free. COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY CBT, a type of talk therapy, focuses on changing negative thought patterns, and then learning how to home in on specific problems and find new ways to approach them. It typically lasts for 10 to 20 sessions. Some studies have shown it to be as effective as medication. BEHAVIORAL-ACTIVATION THERAPY People with depression often withdraw from the world, and this therapy seeks to bring them back in. Treatment involves helping people identify activities that add meaning to their life, like reading, volunteering or hanging out with friends, and encourages them to do these things without waiting for their mood to lift first. In a recent study published in the Lancet, this kind of therapy was shown to be as effective as CBT. And it costs much less, because practitioners don’t need as much training. MINDFULNESS TRAINING “Thoughts and images are often the source of sadness and fear, and if you have no training in getting your attention away from them, you’re helpless,” says Weil. One such program, an eight-week small-group treatment called mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, trains people to be aware of the present moment through mindfulness practices like gentle yoga and daily meditation. It was shown in a 2016 study in JAMA Psychiatry to help people with recurrent depression avoid relapses even better than antidepressants. TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION In TMS, a large magnetic coil is held against the scalp near a part of the brain believed to be important for mood. Magnetic pulses painlessly pass through the skull to stimulate nerve cells, and though how it works is still a mystery, it’s thought to help normalize brain circuits involved in depression. TMS is not invasive, and people receive it when they’re awake, without anesthesia. It typically requires sessions several times a week for four to six weeks and seems to have few serious side effects. In 2008, the FDA approved it as a treatment for people with major depression who hadn’t responded to at least one antidepressant.

But experts say it’s well past time to discard those antiquated notions of what resistance training can do for your physique and health. Modern exercise science shows that working with weights—whether that weight is a light dumbbell or your own body—may be the best exercise for lifelong physical function and fitness. “To me, resistance training is the most important form of training for overall health and wellness,” says Brad Schoenfeld, an assistant professor of exercise science at New York City’s Lehman College. During the past decade, Schoenfeld has published more than 30 academic papers on every aspect of resistance training—from the biomechanics of the push-up to the body’s nutrient needs following a hard lift. Many people think of weight training as exercise that augments muscle size and strength, which is certainly true. But Schoenfeld says the “load” that this form of training puts on bones and their supporting muscles, tendons and ligaments is probably a bigger deal when it comes to health and physical function. “We talk about bone resorption, which is a decrease in bone tissue over time,” he says. When you’re young, bone resorption is balanced and in some cases exceeded by new bone tissue generation. But later in life, bone tissue losses accelerate and outpace the creation of new bone. That acceleration is especially pronounced among people who are sedentary and women who have reached or passed menopause, Schoenfeld says. This loss of bone tissue leads to the weakness and postural problems that plague many older adults. MORE: This Is The Best Workout For Women “Resistance training counteracts all those bone losses and postural deficits,” he says. Through a process known as bone remodeling, strength training stimulates the development of bone osteoblasts: cells that build bones back up. While you can achieve some of these bone benefits through aerobic exercise, especially in your lower body, resistance training is really the best way to maintain and enhance total-body bone strength. More research links resistance training with improved insulin sensitivity among people with diabetes and prediabetes. One study published in the journal Diabetes Care found that twice-weekly training sessions helped control insulin swings (and body weight) among older men with type-2 diabetes. “Muscle is very metabolically active, and it uses glucose, or blood sugar, for energy,” says Mark Peterson, an assistant professor of physical medicine at the University of Michigan. During a bout of resistance training, your muscles are rapidly using glucose, and this energy consumption continues even after you’ve finished exercising, Peterson says. For anyone at risk for metabolic conditions—type-2 diabetes, but also high blood pressure, unhealthy cholesterol levels and other symptoms of metabolic syndrome—strength training is among the most-effective remedies, he says. Strength training also seems to be a potent antidote to inflammation, a major risk factor for heart disease and other conditions, says Schoenfeld. A 2010 study from the University of Connecticut linked regular resistance training with inflammation-quelling shifts in the body’s levels of cytokines, a type of immune system protein. Another study from Mayo Clinic found that when overweight women did twice-weekly resistance training sessions, they had significant drops in several markers of inflammation. More research has linked strength training to improved focus and cognitive function, better balance, less anxiety and greater well-being.  Some of the latest and most surprising research is in the realm of “light-load training,” or lifting very small weights. “It used to be thought that you needed to lift heavy loads in order to build muscle and achieve a lot of these benefits,” Schoenfeld says. “That’s what I was taught in grad school and undergrad, but now it looks like that’s completely untrue.” MORE: Why Men Have More Body Image Issues Than Ever He says lifting “almost to failure”—or until your muscles are near the point of giving out—is the real key, regardless of how much weight you’re using. “This is a huge boon to adherence, because many older adults or those with injuries or joint issues may not be able to lift heavy loads,” he says. If all that isn’t convincing enough to turn you onto weights, perhaps this is: maintaining strength later in life “seems to be one of the best predictors of survival,” says Peterson. “When we add strength…almost every health outcome improves.” “It used to be we thought of strength training as something for athletes,” he adds, “but now we recognize it as a seminal part of general health and well-being at all ages.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4618826/strength-training-fitness-workout/?iid=sr-link1", "http://time.com/4622653/men-body-image-muscle-steroids/"], "sentiment_score": 0.2114902312599681, "subjectivity_score": 0.4511508447692657},

But the practice itself may be just the antidote the over-60 set needs, suggests a recent review of studies about relaxation exercises. Those who did yoga and other calming activities saw greater reductions in their anxiety and depression than people who didn’t. The body of literature on yoga’s relaxation benefits spans all kinds of people, but the authors thought adults aged 60 and older deserved their own analysis. Up to 40% of older adults report anxiety, they note, and anywhere from 15-20% of the elderly experience depression. So in the review published in the journal Aging & Mental Health, researchers scrutinized 15 studies—12 of them randomized controlled trials—from the past two decades that looked at different methods of relaxation. They gauged the effectiveness of six techniques: yoga, listening to music, tensing and relaxing different groups of muscles, massage therapy and stress management training. MORE: Is Bikram Yoga Safe? The most effective ways to alleviate depression were yoga, the music intervention and the muscle tensing and relaxing exercise—called PMRT, for progressive muscle relaxation training. The music and yoga interventions were the best for anxiety. Yoga had the strongest staying power. Positive effects from the stretching, breathing and meditation exercises stuck around six months later in older adults. “It could help counterbalance the negative effects of ageing, improve physical functioning, postpone disability, decrease morbidity and mortality, stimulate the mind, and increase hope, reducing the risk of anxiety and depression,” the study authors write. MORE: 15 Ways Exercise Makes You Look and Feel Younger And good vibes from PMRT lasted 14 weeks after the intervention ended. “It is believed that the PMRT has a tranquilising effect, triggers a sense of peacefulness, helps participants retreat mentally from their problem and curtails negative thoughts, reducing depressive symptoms,” the authors write.

But the authors say there’s a lack of high-quality evidence to back up their conclusion, and that more research is needed—especially on yoga’s long-term effects. The review summarizes the results of 12 clinical trials involving more than 1,000 people in the United States, the United Kingdom and India. All participants had chronic, non-specific low back pain, meaning that their symptoms had lasted at least three months and were not explained by a specific disease or injury. All of the studies compared practicing yoga in a class setting to other forms of exercise or to doing no back-focused exercises at all. Overall, the review found that compared to no exercise, yoga might improve back-related function—and reduce symptoms of lower back pain—by a small amount in the first six months to one year of practice. The amount of improvement seen in most of the studies was minor, says lead author Susan Wieland, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “These differences were small, and might not be very meaningful to patients,” she says. The studies also had follow-up periods of only 12 months or less. Larger studies that track results for longer lengths of time are needed to really understand how yoga might help these people, Wieland adds. Because of these limitations, Wieland and her co-authors determined that the evidence of yoga’s benefits for back pain was only of “low- to moderate-certainty.” For studies that compared yoga to other types of exercise, the findings were even less conclusive, providing “very low-certainty” evidence of minor differences. The report also warns back pain sufferers to approach yoga with caution, as the mind-body practice could make their condition worse. In the review, about 5% more people experienced greater back pain after starting a practice, compared to those who did no exercise. This risk may be similar for any type of back-focused exercise, the authors note, and may not be specific to yoga. Wieland also points out that all of the routines practiced in the studies were developed specifically for people with low back pain, and classes were led by experienced professionals. “If people are considering yoga, they should do their best to check that the program is safe and intended for back-pain sufferers, and that teacher has some amount of experience with this population,” she says. Chronic low back pain is one of the most common and burdensome health problems in the United States. It’s often treated with over-the-counter medication and self-care methods like ice packs and heating pads. Current guidelines also suggest that physical activity and stretching and strengthening exercises can be beneficial. “Research shows that being active is a smart thing to do,” says Wieland. It should be up to patients and their doctors to decide exactly how they want to be active, she adds, “but the evidence suggests that yoga can be one option to consider.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.09733302411873838, "subjectivity_score": 0.34655225726654304},

But there are other ways to rein in health care costs that have been almost entirely overlooked. Making a serious effort to reduce loneliness could make a real difference.  Lonely people put heavy demands on our health care system. Loneliness impairs immune response and makes people more likely to develop serious medical problems like heart disease and stroke. According to one meta-analysis, loneliness increases the risk of early death as much as smoking or being 100 pounds overweight. The risk is highest in people younger than 65. But lonely people don’t go to doctors just for medical care. They’re also dying for social contact. Although loneliness is now recognized as a major public health problem, there hasn’t been much discussion about how to address it. As a clinician who treats mental health issues caused by loneliness, I’ve come to believe that we can’t develop effective interventions for loneliness without first understanding what causes it. Although isolation is an important risk factor, having company doesn’t always prevent loneliness — and being alone doesn’t always cause it. Someone in a bad marriage may feel lonely in the presence of a distant or rejecting spouse, for example. Loneliness is the experience of being not alone but without the other in a way that feels meaningful. What matters is the internal experience. Some people are content on their own. As the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott explained, people like this never actually feel alone internally. What protects them is the early experience of having what he called “a good-enough mother.” A good-enough mother isn’t perfect, but she cares deeply for her child and values him for who he is. Wherever these contented souls go, they carry with them an ongoing sense of the mother’s caring and attentive presence. But many people are not that lucky. It’s well-known that people who were abused as children are at higher risk of getting into abusive relationships as adults. Similarly, people who suffered from emotional neglect as children have a high risk of reliving that experience as well. They felt lonely and uncared for as children, and they feel that way as adults too. Chronic loneliness can be the aftermath of early emotional neglect. This kind of neglect is often invisible to others. A child may grow up in a family where everything seems normal on the outside, but still feel lonely if he can’t get from his mother the love and attention he needs to thrive. A depressed, withdrawn mother is not likely to be emotionally available to her child, even if she goes through the motions of doing what’s needed. Sometimes a mother may feel so depressed and deadened herself that she deadens the relationship with her child, as described by the French psychoanalyst Andre Green. In other cases, the mother may be distant and rejecting — or so oblivious to her child’s thoughts and feelings, and so out of touch with who he is, that she leaves the child feeling stranded emotionally and alone. Fathers are very important too, of course; they can mitigate or worsen the effect of mothers in this regard. But since mothers are usually the primary caretakers, particularly of very young children, they usually have the greatest effect when it comes to providing a buffer from loneliness or leaving children vulnerable to it. Anyone who tried to get close to his mother as a child and failed may well feel hopeless about developing close relationships later in life. Sometimes hopelessness has a neurological basis: Severe early neglect impedes development of neurons responsible for optimism. But, sadly, people who suffered from emotional neglect as children may also act in such a way as to make the expectation of loneliness a self-fulfilling prophecy. Children who feel uncared for generally blame themselves. As adults, they may hang back from others because of a lingering sense of shame about feeling unwanted, or because they feel they don’t deserve to be loved. Some people do more than hang back. They almost seem to cling to loneliness and to the social isolation that feeds it. Neurobiological mechanisms may play a part in this, because loneliness activates the fight-or-flight response, making people hypersensitive to threat and more likely to respond to others in a fearful or defensive manner. But psychological factors are important too. If loneliness was the most powerful feeling you had with your mother, you may cling to the feeling of loneliness because that’s what connects you most closely to her. Without realizing it, some people may be reluctant to relinquish isolation and the loneliness it creates because loneliness feels like a kind of private space which is shared with a distant and rejecting mother. Of course, we could all ask, “Why would you want to hold onto that?” Well, we’re not always rational! We all bear the imprint of early relationships with parents; most of us replay even painful parts of those relationships over and over again. Freud called this the repetition compulsion. We fall into old patterns in part because they’re familiar, and in part perhaps as a way of showing loyalty to parents who were once everything to us. According to the Scottish psychoanalyst  W.R.D. Fairbairn and others, nothing motivates us more powerfully than the longing for intimate connections with others. All else being equal, nobody would choose a painful relationship, but if that’s what he’s given as a child, that’s what he has — and that’s what he holds tight to. Painful relationships are better than nothing. This can be seen in a highly controversial experiment by American psychologist Harry Harlow. Harlow first deprived baby monkeys of maternal affection, causing them to become panicky, and then offered each monkey a choice between a cloth mother and a bare wire mother that held a bottle with food. The monkeys preferred the more huggable cloth option; each baby monkey became attached to its own cloth mother, and would cling to this inanimate surrogate even though it offered no food. Children love their parents even when they’ve been abused. The same holds true for children who’ve been neglected. If a child’s relationship with his mother leaves him feeling profoundly lonely, that’s what he has, and that’s what he holds tight to. Paradoxically perhaps, the less emotional nourishment someone gets from her mother, the more tightly she may want to hold on. It’s a lot easier to separate from a mother who makes you feel loved and secure in the world than it is to turn away from a mother who seems to be on the brink of disappearing emotionally herself. Some people may cling to social isolation because isolation is what most closely reflects their emotional experience as children. Longstanding loneliness may signal what is perhaps best understood as a kind of attachment disorder, with ongoing attachment to a depressed, withdrawn or rejecting mother. When chronic loneliness comes from childhood neglect, social outreach programs are not likely to be sufficient. We need to think more carefully about what causes loneliness, and what seems to be the peculiar attachment of some people to a condition which they find deeply painful. Then we can tailor interventions to address the cause, rather than just the condition of being alone.

There’s nothing funny about disease and dying, but for a whole year we compared notes in a humorous way. We each used hyperbole to describe our plights and made dark jokes about whose family situation was more depressing. We made fun to relieve our sadness (albeit temporarily), and that ability to make each other laugh helped us both get through the tragedy. Another good thing about a friend with a great sense of humor? She usually has warmth and compassion to spare. Lucinda Rosenfeld is the author of four novels, including The Pretty One ($26, amazon.com) and I’m So Happy for You ($14, amazon.com). A former friendship and advice columnist for Slate, she lives in New York City. The Life Coach Because of our busy lives, I hardly ever speak to one of my closest friends. But it doesn’t really matter. When we do connect, without fail, she reinvigorates me. Her pep talks make me feel more hopeful about myself and my future. What’s more, my energizer friend is strong and tough, with a vigor for life I can feed off of. Through her example, she makes me more eager to achieve my goals or just keep tackling my everyday. Talking with her recharges my emotional battery until the next time we have a minute to pick up the phone. Courtney Macavinta is the author of Respect ($16, amazon.com) and a cofounder of the Respect Institute, a nonprofit that offers youths the tools to build self-respect. She lives in New York City. The Risk Taker We all need an adventurous friend who nudges us out of the status quo—someone who introduces us to new ideas, philosophies, and activities that we might have otherwise not been exposed to or feared to explore on our own. I’ve long been inspired by a world-traveler friend whose preschooler’s passport has more stamps than most adults.’ She has helped me become less intimidated and more excited about traveling. In fact, thanks to her, my husband and I drove an RV across Canada two summers ago with our three children, who were all four or under. Scary? Yes. But we had so much fun, we’re going again this year. Andrea Bonior, Ph.D., is a licensed clinical psychologist and the author of The Friendship Fix ($16,amazon.com). She lives in Bethesda, Maryland. The Challenger One characteristic we underrate in a friend is the ability to be brutally honest. That’s why I’ve always admired the friendship of the women’s rights leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. They led very different lives. Anthony was single; Stanton, a married mother of seven. And they continually and vociferously argued about temperance, abolition, sexual rights, and suffrage. But because they were able to challenge and educate each other, they accomplished much for females in the United States. It’s also why they remained close, trusted friends for more than half a century. Mary Ann Dzuback, Ph.D., is the director of women, gender, and sexuality studies at Washington University, in St. Louis. The Loyalist Every woman needs a “hot mess” friend—by which I mean a friend you can be a complete wreck in front of. This pal can drop in unannounced when you’re looking your worst. You haven’t showered and the house is a total disaster, but she won’t judge you. More important, she’ll let you be emotional when you’re at a low point. Recently I was at dinner with a friend when I got the call that I hadn’t landed a big acting job. I tried to pretend that it was no big deal, but she didn’t buy it. She said, “I’d rather you talk about being bummed than wear a fake smile all night.” And so I vented my frustration at not getting the job, and she really listened. We all need a friend who hangs in there even when we’re not at our best. Ariane Price is a member of The Groundlings, a famed improv troupe in Los Angeles.

New research suggests you can inoculate yourself with a hug—sort of. For a study published Thursday in the journal Psychological Science, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University had an inkling that hugs—as an indicator of social support but also because it involves touch—might pack a flu-fighting punch. Studies have shown that strong social ties can protect against stress, anxiety and depression, and the researchers wanted to see if they can be a buffer for a purely physiological diseases, too. The researchers discovered that it did. For two weeks, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University called up 400 people daily and assessed their levels of social support. They asked them if they’d been hugged that day, and if they were experiencing any conflicts or tension with people. The researchers then gave them nasal drops brimming with either the cold or flu virus, quarantined them for about a week in a hotel, and monitored their symptoms. (Everyone who participated in the study was compensated for their time, says study co-author Sheldon Cohen, professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon.) Even though everyone was exposed to infection-causing drops, 78% who developed an infection and 31% actually got sick—meaning they had physical symptoms of illness. For the unfortunate third whose hugs weren’t enough to prevent physical symptoms of being sick, they at least got some big benefit: those who got regularly hugged and those who felt they had more social support had less severe symptoms than the hug-deprived. “There’s a lot of evidence out there suggesting that touch might be really effective at protecting people from stressors,” says Cohen, and this study adds to that very hug-friendly body of work. “It’s a communication to people that you care about them, and that you have a close intimate relationship with them.” And as for the ideal “dose” of hugs? Cohen says: “It looks like one hug a day might be enough.” Write to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.04058441558441558, "subjectivity_score": 0.37289258360686933},

But physical activity doesn’t always have to be vigorous to be effective. While it may seem mellow compared to most training programs, yoga’s health benefits keep pace—and often outdistance—what many people would call “traditional” forms of exercise. For starters, research shows regular yoga practice lowers your risk for heart disease and hypertension. Yoga may also lessen symptoms of depression, headaches, diabetes, some forms of cancer and pain-related diseases like arthritis. Yoga also seems to combat weight gain. One 4-year study from Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center found middle-aged adults who practiced yoga at least once a week gained 3 fewer pounds than those who stuck with other forms of exercise. The same study found overweight adults who practice yoga lost 5 pounds, while a non-yoga group gained 13 pounds. Those results held even when the authors accounted for different eating habits. How can a little bending and stretching do all that? Unlike exercises like running or lifting weights—both of which crank up your heart rate and stimulate your nervous system—yoga does just the opposite. “It puts you in a parasympathetic state, so your heart rate goes down and blood pressure goes down,” says Dr. Tiffany Field, director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Field has published an in-depth review of yoga’s potential health benefits. She says the types and varieties of movement involved in yoga stimulate pressure receptors in your skin, which in turn ramp up your brain and body’s vagal activity. Your vagus nerve connects your brain to several of your organs, and it also plays a role in hormone production and release. “Stress hormones like cortisol decrease as vagal activity increases,” Field says. At the same time, this uptick in vagal activity triggers the release of the hormone serotonin, which helps regulate everything from your mood and appetite to your sleep patterns. All of this may explain yoga’s research-backed ties to a healthier heart, as well as its ability to slash your stress, improve your mood, quell your appetite and help you sleep more soundly, Field says. When you consider the health perks linked to each of those brain and body benefits—lower inflammation, lower body weight, lower disease risk—you could make an argument that few activities are as good for you as yoga. One thing yoga doesn’t do, though, is burn loads of calories. Even hot forms of yoga like Bikram result in modest energy expenditures—roughly the number of calories you’d burn during a brisk walk. While more and more research suggests calories shouldn’t be your sole focus when it comes to diet and exercise, there’s no question that running, swimming, lifting weights and other more-vigorous forms of exercise are great for your brain and body. Yoga is unquestionably good for you, Field says, but it should be done in tandem with traditional forms of physical activity—not in place of them.

In the report, published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, researchers assessed 32 adult men who reported having symptoms of ADHD. (Of those 32, two had an official diagnosis from a psychiatrist.) The researchers measured the men’s ability to pay attention, their motivation to perform mental tasks, leg hyperactivity, and their mood before and after they either sat or biked for 20 minutes. The researchers thought that perhaps exercise would behave similarly in the brain as stimulant medications frequently taken by people with ADHD. “There is very strong and consistent evidence that a single short, moderate-intensity bout of exercise is associated with increased feelings of energy, so if people need a reason to work out, the energy boost with exercise is a worthwhile one,” says study author Patrick J. O’Connor, Ph.D., of the Department of Kinesiology at the University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia. Exercising, the study authors report, did enhance motivation and overall energy levels. The men also reported fewer feelings of fatigue, depression and confusion after they exercised. It didn’t have an effect on cognitive abilities or levels of hyperactivity, but the study authors found that exercise also didn’t increase feelings of hyperactivity either. The researchers say their findings encourage more research on non-pharmaceutical ways to improve ADHD symptoms. “The effects of acute moderate exercise may not last as long as the effects of stimulant medications based on findings from the current study, but the effects of acute exercise could be more immediate, meaning individuals who exercise could benefit sooner than those who chose to use a stimulant medication,” the authors write. They also say that if a person’s medication is not immediately available, they may want to consider exercise as “a useful adjunct for immediate ADHD symptom management.” More research is needed before people make any treatment decisions based on these findings. The number of people in the study is very small, so nothing terribly definitive can be gleaned from the work, but it adds support to the argument that exercise does more than improve fitness and muscle mass. Another much larger study published in 2014 in JAMA Psychiatry followed 11,000 people for 50 years. They found that people who are active during adulthood had fewer symptoms of depression than people who didn’t work out as often. Evidence has suggested that exercise can spur the release of hormones and chemicals like endorphins that can alter a person’s mood, and a 2015 study suggested that exercise may also be able to prevent the onset of depression symptoms in the first place. The study looked at 10 years of data from nearly 3,000 adult women and found that those who were getting in 150 minutes of moderately intense exercise each week had fewer depression symptoms. The more exercise the women did, the less likely they were to report feeling depressed. Given the high number of people in the United States who don’t exercise and the high number of people who take drugs for depression, experts are recommending that exercise be considered as a first line treatment. More data is needed to support the advice, but there are plenty of other reasons to work out for better health.

But experts say it’s well past time to discard those antiquated notions of what resistance training can do for your physique and health. Modern exercise science shows that working with weights—whether that weight is a light dumbbell or your own body—may be the best exercise for lifelong physical function and fitness. “To me, resistance training is the most important form of training for overall health and wellness,” says Brad Schoenfeld, an assistant professor of exercise science at New York City’s Lehman College. During the past decade, Schoenfeld has published more than 30 academic papers on every aspect of resistance training—from the biomechanics of the push-up to the body’s nutrient needs following a hard lift. Many people think of weight training as exercise that augments muscle size and strength, which is certainly true. But Schoenfeld says the “load” that this form of training puts on bones and their supporting muscles, tendons and ligaments is probably a bigger deal when it comes to health and physical function. “We talk about bone resorption, which is a decrease in bone tissue over time,” he says. When you’re young, bone resorption is balanced and in some cases exceeded by new bone tissue generation. But later in life, bone tissue losses accelerate and outpace the creation of new bone. That acceleration is especially pronounced among people who are sedentary and women who have reached or passed menopause, Schoenfeld says. This loss of bone tissue leads to the weakness and postural problems that plague many older adults. MORE: This Is The Best Workout For Women “Resistance training counteracts all those bone losses and postural deficits,” he says. Through a process known as bone remodeling, strength training stimulates the development of bone osteoblasts: cells that build bones back up. While you can achieve some of these bone benefits through aerobic exercise, especially in your lower body, resistance training is really the best way to maintain and enhance total-body bone strength. More research links resistance training with improved insulin sensitivity among people with diabetes and prediabetes. One study published in the journal Diabetes Care found that twice-weekly training sessions helped control insulin swings (and body weight) among older men with type-2 diabetes. “Muscle is very metabolically active, and it uses glucose, or blood sugar, for energy,” says Mark Peterson, an assistant professor of physical medicine at the University of Michigan. During a bout of resistance training, your muscles are rapidly using glucose, and this energy consumption continues even after you’ve finished exercising, Peterson says. For anyone at risk for metabolic conditions—type-2 diabetes, but also high blood pressure, unhealthy cholesterol levels and other symptoms of metabolic syndrome—strength training is among the most-effective remedies, he says. Strength training also seems to be a potent antidote to inflammation, a major risk factor for heart disease and other conditions, says Schoenfeld. A 2010 study from the University of Connecticut linked regular resistance training with inflammation-quelling shifts in the body’s levels of cytokines, a type of immune system protein. Another study from Mayo Clinic found that when overweight women did twice-weekly resistance training sessions, they had significant drops in several markers of inflammation. More research has linked strength training to improved focus and cognitive function, better balance, less anxiety and greater well-being.  Some of the latest and most surprising research is in the realm of “light-load training,” or lifting very small weights. “It used to be thought that you needed to lift heavy loads in order to build muscle and achieve a lot of these benefits,” Schoenfeld says. “That’s what I was taught in grad school and undergrad, but now it looks like that’s completely untrue.” MORE: Why Men Have More Body Image Issues Than Ever He says lifting “almost to failure”—or until your muscles are near the point of giving out—is the real key, regardless of how much weight you’re using. “This is a huge boon to adherence, because many older adults or those with injuries or joint issues may not be able to lift heavy loads,” he says. If all that isn’t convincing enough to turn you onto weights, perhaps this is: maintaining strength later in life “seems to be one of the best predictors of survival,” says Peterson. “When we add strength…almost every health outcome improves.” “It used to be we thought of strength training as something for athletes,” he adds, “but now we recognize it as a seminal part of general health and well-being at all ages.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4618826/strength-training-fitness-workout/?iid=sr-link1", "http://time.com/4622653/men-body-image-muscle-steroids/"], "sentiment_score": 0.2114902312599681, "subjectivity_score": 0.4511508447692657},
{"type": "article", "header": "Why Swimming Is So Good For You", "author": "Markham Heid", "update_date/publish_date": "March 2, 2017 12:17 PM EST", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4688623/swimming-pool-health-benefits/?iid=sr-link1", "text": "Every type of exercise has its selling points. But swimming is unlike any other aerobic workout in a few important ways. First, the fact that you’re submerged in water means your bones and muscles are somewhat unshackled from the constraints of gravity, says Hirofumi Tanaka, a professor of kinesiology and director of the Cardiovascular Aging Research Lab at the University of Texas. This makes swimming the ideal exercise for people with osteoarthritis, for whom weight-bearing exercise can be excruciatingly painful. According to Tanaka’s research of people with the condition, swimming decreases arterial stiffness, a risk factor for heart trouble. More of his research has linked swim training with lower blood pressure among people with hypertension. The coolness and buoyancy of water are also appealing to people who are overweight or obese, for whom load-bearing aerobic exercises like running may be too hot or uncomfortable, Tanaka says. But don’t be fooled; your body is working hard when you’re in the pool. Water is denser than air, so moving through H2O puts more external pressure on your limbs than out-of-water training, studies have shown. Even better, that pressure is uniformly distributed. It doesn’t collect in your knees, hips or the other places that bear most of the burden when you exercise with gravity sitting on your shoulders. How you breathe during a swimming workout is another big differentiator, says David Tanner, a research associate at Indiana University and co-editor of an educational handbook on the science of swimming. During a run or bike ride, your breath tends to be shallow and your exhales forceful. “It’s the other way around with swimming,” says Tanner. “You breathe in quickly and deeply, and then let the air trickle out.” Because your head is under water when you swim, these breathing adjustments are vital, and they may improve the strength of your respiratory muscles, Tanner says. “This kind of breathing keeps the lung alveoli”—the millions of little balloon-like structures that inflate and deflate as your breathe—“from collapsing and sticking together.” Plus, who wouldn’t want a swimmer’s body? Swimming fires up more of your body’s major muscle groups than other forms of cardio exercise. “If you think about running or biking, you’re mostly using your lower body,” Tanner says. Swimming not only engages your legs, but also recruits your upper body and core—especially your lats, the muscles of your middle back, and triceps, the backs of your upper arms. “You look at pictures of swimmers, and you see how the upper body development is really tremendous,” he says. Finally, your back benefits. Working out in a horizontal pose—as opposed to the upright position your body assumes during other forms of aerobic exercise—may be an ideal way to counteract all the time you spend hunched over a desk or steering wheel. “There’s no hard impact on your back like there is with running, and instead of being bent forward like you would be on a bike, your back tends to be arched slightly in the opposite direction,” Tanner says. That may help improve your posture and prevent the back injuries and pain that stem from long stretches of sedentary time. The exercise is also linked to many of the same life-extending, heart-saving, mood-lifting benefits associated with other forms of aerobic exercise. And it’s fun, which matters. “People tend to enjoy swimming more than running or bike-riding,” Tanaka says. While about half of people who try a new exercise program give up within a few months, people who take up swimming are more likely to stick with it, he says. If you’re sold on swimming, Tanner recommends starting slowly. “Don’t try to do too much too early, and focus on proper technique,” he says. Consider enlisting the help of an instructor if you didn’t have any formal coaching as a kid. “If you’re not used to swimming, it can be hard to relax in the water,” he says. Being nervous and tight may limit the sport’s benefits. Start off with 30-minute sessions three times a week, and don’t forget to take frequent breaks. “You want to ease into it and build up,” he says, “just like a running program.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": [], "sentiment_score": 0.09007898817600309, "subjectivity_score": 0.40756606577502114},

There’s no denying that running is one of the most democratic ways to work out. You can do it anytime, anywhere, and all you need is a good pair of running shoes and some stamina. It’s no wonder, then, that more and more Americans are adopting the sport and doing it competitively; the number of people who finished organized races grew 300% in the U.S. from 1990 to 2013, and in 2015, there were slightly more than 17 million Americans who ran in races nationwide. Still, estimates suggest that 79% of runners will get injured at some point, a statistic that’s remained relatively stable for more than 40 years. “Running is hard on the wheels, especially if you’re doing long-distance running,” says James O’Keefe, a cardiologist at St. Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City and a former runner. “A lot of people will break down orthopedically.” Since more than 80 million Americans are living a sedentary lifestyle, there are certainly plenty of people who could benefit from running rather than doing nothing at all—and if you do run already, there is no reason to stop unless a doctor tells you to. The latest science on running and its effects on the body offers both encouraging and cautionary takeaways for people who enjoy the sport. Running has a reputation for causing wear and tear, but new research suggests that it may actually prevent injuries rather than increase the risk of them. A small study published in December 2016 found that 30 minutes of running lowered inflammation in runners’ knee joints. In the report, researchers at Brigham Young University brought 15 healthy runners into a lab where samples of their blood and knee-joint fluid were taken before and after they ran for 30 minutes. The researchers then compared the samples with ones taken earlier when the men and women were sedentary. The researchers expected to find an increase in molecules that spur inflammation, but they didn’t. Instead, they found that pro-inflammatory markers had decreased. “It was surprising,” says study author Matt Seeley, an associate professor of exercise science at BYU. Seeley emphasizes that the report is a pilot and that his team plans to do the same study with more people in the near future. “I think, and hope, the data will show that running is good for your joints,” he adds. “Although the results are limited, they are also unexpected and could be important.” Not everyone is convinced. “There is data on both sides of the fence,” says Brian Feeley, an orthopedic surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn’t involved with the study. “We know there are some people who run all the time with no problems and others that have arthritis at a relatively young age.” For now, people of all abilities should allow themselves time to recover post-workout. Women make up about 57% of race finishers, and data suggests that the number of female runners is up worldwide. But men and women tend to run in different ways, and in some cases, that can mean more injuries for women. Stephen Messier, director of the J.B. Snow Biomechanics Laboratory at Wake Forest University, is trying to understand why female runners get injured more often than men. So far he’s found that women tend to have higher arches and point their toes out more as they run. “We don’t know if those differences attribute to a greater risk for injury,” says Messier, but his team is trying to find out. Prior research has found that female runners are more likely to be heel strikers, which some experts think increases risk of injury because of higher-impact landings. The way people’s hips and knees are naturally aligned may also increase their risk. Women also tend to have less strength in their core and hips, which could affect them. That shouldn’t deter women from running, however. Women have more body fat, which is beneficial for energy storage and endurance, and they’re typically more flexible than men, which can benefit their muscles. Women also appear to be better at pacing themselves during races compared with men. To prevent heel striking, experts suggest that people try landing closer to their midfoot or landing softer during each stride. Messier is also launching a trial that puts female runners through strength-training exercises to see if some bulking up can help them lower their injury risk overall. As the popularity of competitive running increases, more people are doing it later in life, too. “Generations before us weren’t doing this,” says O’Keefe. “People weren’t running over 10 miles a day into their 60s.” Today, people age 40 and up make up nearly 50% of marathon finishers in the U.S., whereas in 1980, they made up just 26%. O’Keefe says there is no definite age cutoff at which running is no longer good for you, but curbing it with age may be a good idea. “Many people find that their joints feel better if they do brisk walking rather than running after age 45 or 50,” he says. “I do advise people over age 45 to avoid chronic very-high-intensity long-distance running, as the body is not as resilient as we get older.” One study looked at marathon runners and their non-runner spouses and found that the runners were thinner and had lower blood pressure and heart rate. But the findings also showed that the older racers had a lot of plaque in their arteries and scored higher on a measurement of heart-attack risk. Other types of exercise, like high-intensity interval training and strength-based exercises, are good to mix in as you age. Pilates and yoga have also been shown to improve flexibility and balance, which are important for runners—and in aging. “If people tell me they are running 25 miles a week, I ask: Why are you doing it?” says O’Keefe. “If it’s to relax, be social or for long-term health, I tell them you’re better off running a mile and a half and then going to a yoga class.

In the study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, people who did more moderate-intensity physical activity were more likely to have healthy patterns of glucose metabolism in their brains—a sign of healthy brain activity—than those who did less. Light-intensity physical activity, on the other hand, was not associated with similar benefits. The study involved 93 adults with an average age of 64, all of whom had at least one parent with Alzheimer’s disease, at least one gene variation linked to Alzheimer’s disease, or both. This put them at high risk for developing the disease themselves, although none showed any cognitive impairment at the time of the study. To illuminate the relationship between brain activity and exercise levels, everyone wore an accelerometer for a week to measure their daily physical activity and received PET scans to measure glucose metabolism, which reveals neuron health and activity, in several regions of the brain. For people with Alzheimer’s disease, these regions tend to have depressed glucose metabolism. Researchers found that people who spent at least 68 minutes a day engaged in physical activity at a moderate level—the equivalent of a brisk walk—had better glucose metabolism in all of those regions than those who spent less time doing so. The amounts of time spent being sedentary or doing less-intense physical activity (like slow walking) were not associated with changes in any of the brain regions studied. Vigorous activity was linked to better glucose metabolism in one brain region—the hippocampus—but not in the others. Larger doses of high-intensity exercise may be needed to provide the benefits of just “a modest increase” in moderate activity, the authors wrote, suggesting that you don’t have to exercise to the extreme to get brain benefits. Past research comparing the brain-boosting power of moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise has been mixed, says lead author Ozioma Okonkwo, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. But in general, he says, the evidence suggests that “light activity is insufficient, and vigorous activity might be unnecessary.” Being able to quantify the connection between moderate-intensity activity and brain health is an exciting and important step in Alzheimer’s research, the researchers say, although further studies are needed in order to show a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and glucose metabolism—and to demonstrate real-life benefits. (The team is currently recruiting people with concerns about their brain health for a clinical trial to help determine the right dose of exercise for people with mild memory problems.) But Okonkwo points out that previous research has already established a connection between glucose metabolism and cognitive function. “We’re showing now that a moderate-intensity active lifestyle actually boosts neuronal function,” he says. “I don’t think it’s too much of a leap to make the argument that this probably is one of the pathways through which exercise prevents cognitive decline in middle life.” Okonkwo says this research offers reassurance that people can take steps to protect themselves against Alzheimer’s disease, even if they are at high genetic risk. “The evidence shows that it’s never too late to take up and maintain a physically active regimen,” he says. “It also suggests that the earlier you begin and the longer you continue it, the more benefits you tend to accrue.” Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/4447997/untangling-alzheimers/?iid=sr-link1"], "sentiment_score": 0.048684422921711074, "subjectivity_score": 0.4088744024337245},

In a study published Thursday in Science, an international team, led by Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte at the Salk Institute, studied the gene responsible for an accelerated aging disease known as Werner syndrome, or adult progeria, in which patients show signs of osteoporosis, grey hair and heart disease in very early adulthood. These patients are deficient in a gene responsible for copying DNA, repairing any mistakes in that replication process, and for keeping track of telomeres, the fragments of DNA at the ends of chromosomes that are like a genetic clock dictating the cell’s life span. Belmonte—together with scientists at the University Catolica San Antonio Murcia and the Institute of Biophysics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences—wanted to understand how the mutated gene triggered aging in cells. So they took embryonic stem cells, which can develop into all of the cells of the human body, and removed this gene. They then watched as the cells aged prematurely, and found that the reason they became older so quickly had to do with how their DNA was packaged.  MORE: The Cure for Aging In order to function properly, DNA is tightly twisted and wound into chromosomes that resemble a rope in the nucleus of cells. Only when the cell is ready to divide does the DNA unwrap itself, and even then, only in small segments at a time. In patients with Werner syndrome, the chromosomes are slightly messier, more loosely stuffed into the nuclei, and that leads to instability that pushes the cell to age more quickly. Belmonte discovered that the Werner gene regulates this chromosome stability. When he allowed the embryonic stem cells that were missing this gene to grow into cells that go on to become bone, muscle and more, he saw that these cells aged more quickly. “It’s clear that when you have alterations in [chromosome stability], the process of aging goes so quickly and so fast that it’s tempting to say, yes, this is the key process for driving aging,” says Belmonte. Even more exciting, when he analyzed a population of stem cells taken from the dental pulp of both younger and older people, he found that the older individuals, aged 58 to 72 years, had fewer genetic markers for the chromosome instability while the younger people aged seven to 26 years showed higher levels of these indicators.  MORE: What Diet Helps People Live the Longest? “What this study means is that this protein does not only work in a particular genetic disease, it works in all humans,” says Belmonte. “This mechanism is general for aging process.” Before it can be considered as the Fountain of Youth, however, Belmonte says new and better techniques need to be developed that can more specifically and safely alter the Werner gene in people, not just a culture dish of human cells. He also stresses that there may be other processes contributing to aging, and it’s not clear yet how important chromosome stability is compared to those factors. But, he says. “having technologies like this will allow us to determine how important each of these parameters are for aging.” And if the findings hold up, they could be first step toward finding a way to help cells, and eventually people, live longer.

Why it’s good for you: Despite being high in saturated fat, coconut oil may good for your heart, weight and energy levels. Coconut oil is comprised of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) which are easily digested and have been shown to help the body burn fat and increase “good” cholesterol levels. More than 50% of coconut oil is comprised of lauric acid, and while lauric acid increases bad cholesterol, it raises your good cholesterol that much more. Some studies suggest improved exercise performance related to MCT consumption, but the data is not yet convincing.

Some studies, including the most recent analysis, suggest that something about being sedentary can lead to poor health outcomes, including heart disease and things like obesity, diabetes and overall “fitness”—which, in technical terms, is a measure of how strong the heart and respiratory system are. Those studies found that even people who exercised weren’t immune to the dangers of sitting—though exercise did help. But were the effects of sitting actually independently lowering fitness and causing health problems, or was the sitting just a reflection of the fact that people who sat more spent less time being active? MORE: Sitting Can Increase Your Risk of Cancer By Up to 66% Kerem Shuval, a research specialist in nutrition and physical activity at the American Cancer Society, and his colleagues wanted to address that question. So they turned to the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study, an ongoing trial of white men that measures how lifestyle behaviors affect disease and longevity. They asked the men about how many hours they spent in a car or watching TV (the sedentary part) and then put them on a treadmill to record their fitness levels, as well as tested their blood for cholesterol and blood sugar. The scientists also calculated the participants’ body fat percentage, their waist circumference and their body mass index (BMI). When they adjusted for the amount of physical activity that the men reported, they found that those who spent more hours each week in a car or watching TV showed higher triglyceride levels, a higher BMI, waist circumference and more body fat compared to those who reported less than nine hours a week of sedentary behavior. MORE: An Hour of Exercise Can Make Up for a Day of Sitting Down But when Shuval then factored in the mens’ fitness levels, he found that most of the interaction with negative health outcomes went away. “Once we controlled for fitness, the effects of sedentary behavior were a lot less pronounced on health outcomes,” he says. So there’s no question that people who are fit, which means they are physically active, and those who exercise regularly, enjoy better health. The question is whether you can get fitter not just by becoming more active, but also by sitting less. “The jury is still out in my mind about what to do about decreasing sitting,” says Shuval, who published his results in Mayo Clinic Proceedings. There are some studies that follow people over time that found that more sitting time is linked to a higher risk of early death. But that could be due to the fact that people who sit more are less physically active, so sitting is displacing exercise. Shuval found, for example, no strong association between how much time people spent sitting and their risk of metabolic syndrome – the constellation of risk factors connected to heart disease – nearly nine years later. That suggests that physical activity, and not something unique about sedentary behavior, may be the driving factor in that syndrome. MORE: Now There’s Another Reason Sitting Will Kill You That’s supported by a study published in PLOS ONE in January 2014 in which researchers from the U.S. and Australia found that when they included all levels of physical activity – not just moderate or vigorous activity, but even the light forms that make up most of what people do during the day – the negative effect of sitting on adverse health measures like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar and waist circumference disappeared. In other words, how active people are – and the more active they are, the less they sit – likely has the strongest effect on health. Shuval, however, admits that his results likely aren’t the definitive ones that will resolve the question of how sitting affects our health. The men in the Cooper study, for example, were only asked about the time they spent in their cars or watching television; they didn’t account for time spent sitting at their jobs, for instance, so the sedentary time could have been underestimated. They also only asked about sedentary habits once, so the study couldn’t account for any changes the participants had in the amount of time they spent in chairs. The uncertainly probably explains why there aren’t yet any guidelines about healthy and unhealthy amounts of sitting time, as there are for physical activity. “We haven’t established yet by how much we need to reduce sedentary behavior and how to do it,” says Shuval. But one thing is clear – sitting less means you are probably more physically active. And there is plenty of evidence suggesting that’s good for your health.   Contact us at letters@time.com", "nested_links": ["http://time.com/2967417/exercise-sitting-down-nhanes/", "http://time.com/2884953/sitting-can-increase-your-risk-of-cancer-by-up-to-66/", "http://time.com/2967417/exercise-sitting-down-nhanes/", "http://time.com/8773/now-theres-another-reason-sitting-will-kill-you/"], "sentiment_score": 0.10362165963431783, "subjectivity_score": 0.3986688768334338},
{"type": "article", "header": "The New Science of Exercise", "author": "Mandy Oaklander", "update_date/publish_date": "September 12, 2016 7:47 AM EDT", "link_to_article": "https://time.com/4475628/the-new-science-of-exercise/?iid=sr-link2", "text": "Ever since high school, Dr. Mark Tarnopolsky has blurred the line between jock and nerd. After working out every morning and doing 200 push-ups, he runs three miles to his lab at McMaster University in Ontario. When he was younger, Tarnopolsky dreamed of becoming a gym teacher. But now, in his backup career as a genetic metabolic neurologist, he’s determined to prove that exercise can be used as medicine for even the sickest patients. “People would always say to me, ‘Exercise? Come on. Scientifically, you can’t come up with a mechanism, so it’s a complete waste of time,'” Tarnopolsky says. “But as time goes on, paper after paper after paper shows that the most effective, potent way that we can improve quality of life and duration of life is exercise.” Tarnopolsky has published some of those papers himself. In 2011, he and a team studied mice with a terrible genetic disease that caused them to age prematurely. Over the course of five months, half of the mice were sedentary. The other half were coaxed to run three times a week on a miniature treadmill. By the end of the study, the sedentary mice were barely hanging on. The fur that had yet to fall out had grown coarse and gray, muscles shriveled, hearts weakened, skin thinned–even the mice’s hearing got worse. “They were shivering in the corner, about to die,” Tarnopolsky says. But the group of mice that exercised, genetically compromised though they were, were nearly indistinguishable from healthy mice. Their coats were sleek and black, they ran around their cages, they could even reproduce. “We almost completely prevented the premature aging in the animals,” Tarnopolsky says. That’s remarkable news, if you’re a mouse. And though there are obvious differences between rodents and humans, Tarnopolsky has seen something similar happen in his ill patients. “I’ve seen all the hype about gene therapy for people with genetic disease”–Tarnopolsky treats kids with severe genetic diseases like muscular dystrophy–“but it hasn’t delivered in the 25 years I’ve been doing this,” he says. “The most effective therapy available to my patients right now is exercise.” Looking to get in shape but don’t know where to start? Sign up for TIME’s guide to getting fitter, faster.  Tarnopolsky now thinks he knows why. In studies where blood is drawn immediately after people exercised, researchers have found that many positive changes occur throughout the body during and right after a workout. “Going for a run is going to improve your skin health, your eye health, your gonadal health,” he says. “It’s unbelievable.” If there were a drug that could do for human health everything that exercise can, it would likely be the most valuable pharmaceutical ever developed. The trouble is only 20% of Americans get the recommended 150 minutes of strength and cardiovascular physical activity per week, more than half of all baby boomers report doing no exercise whatsoever, and 80.2 million Americans over age 6 are entirely inactive. The consequences of a sedentary life are as well documented as they are dire. People with low levels of physical activity are at higher risk for many different kinds of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease and early death by any cause. That’s at the end of life. Long before that, inactivity can worsen arthritis symptoms, increase lower-back pain and lead to depression and anxiety–not to mention cause a sallow complexion. Despite public-awareness campaigns, the health benefits of exercise have not been effectively communicated to the average American. Humans are notoriously bad at assessing the long-term benefits–and risks–of their lifestyle choices. And vague promises that exercise is “good for you” or even “good for the heart” aren’t powerful enough to motivate most people to do something they think of as a chore. Humans are, however, motivated by rewards. That is why experts like Tarnopolsky are so focused on proving that the scientific benefits of exercise–slower aging, better mood, less chronic pain, stronger vision, the list goes on–are real, measurable and almost immediate. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) is on the bandwagon too. Next year the agency will launch a massive new study with the aim of documenting in unprecedented detail exactly what happens inside a body in motion. Its hope: to prove that exercise is medicine. Before doctors adopted a single-minded focus on treating and curing diseases, their main goal was to keep people healthy. Even back in 400 B.C., doctors knew that diet and exercise were the best ways to do that. “Eating alone will not keep a man well,” Hippocrates famously wrote. “He must also take exercise.” For millennia, doctors were the vanguards of physical education–the original PE teachers. But in the early 1900s, with the rise of modern surgery and nascent pharmaceuticals, medicine shifted its focus from the prevention of disease to its treatment. Paradoxically, physicians de-emphasized exercise just as the modern Olympics swelled in popularity and colleges began building campus stadiums to accommodate America’s growing love of spectator sports. The authors of a paper published in a 1905 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association mourned how many people were losing sight of the health benefits of exercise. “The men on the teams are the very ones whom Nature has endowed superabundantly with physical capacity, but on them the physical director bends most of his energies,” they wrote, “while the average student is left to get his physical development by yelling from the bleachers.” Physical activity was no longer the medicine of the masses but the privilege of elite athletes. When scientists studied exercise, it was to figure out how athletes could improve their peak performance–not how mere mortals could improve their health day to day. This gap persists. At a time when boutique (read: expensive) fitness studios are more popular than ever, fewer people are getting the minimum recommended amount of exercise. Worse, many U.S. schools have seen gym classes cut from the curriculum; nearly half of high school students don’t have weekly PE class, and only 15% of elementary schools require PE at least three days a week for the school year. The result: the majority of American kids and adolescents have so-called exercise-deficit disorder. Meanwhile, childhood-obesity rates have climbed every year since 1999. “You have whole generations that are soured on exercise,” says Jack Berryman, professor emeritus of medical history at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Researchers like Tarnopolsky and Marcas Bamman, an exercise physiologist who also wants to be part of the NIH study, are hoping that their work will begin reversing those trends. Next year the NIH will launch its six-year, $170 million study with a group of about 3,000 sedentary people, ranging in age from children to the elderly. They will start an exercise program and then donate blood, fat and muscle before and after they exercise. Scientists will then examine samples for clues to how the body changes with physical activity. A control group that doesn’t exercise will also be tracked for comparison. As part of the study, researchers will do the same experiment in animals to get tissue samples from places like the brain and the lungs that would be too dangerous to obtain from humans. “It’ll be a tremendously enormous data set,” says Maren Laughlin, program director for integrative metabolism at the NIH, who is also a lead on the new study. In the end, the researchers think they’ll be able to identify every single molecule in the body that’s tweaked or turned on by exercise. This kind of study–its size, its rigor, its aims–is a first, and experts are hoping it will give doctors the evidence they need to start treating exercise like the miracle drug they’ve long thought it to be. “If you think of exercise as a true form of medicine, which it is, it’s not good enough to just look at a patient and say, ‘You need to do more exercise,'” says Bamman, director of the Center for Exercise Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “That’s no better than handing someone a bottle of pills and saying, ‘Here, take a few,'” with no other explanation. Bamman is betting that with this new data, exercise will one day be prescribed to patients. Instead of leaving the doctor’s office with nothing but a slip of paper with a drug name scrawled on it, patients may also get a detailed exercise plan tailored to make their medication work better. “We think that precision will go a long way in changing behavior,” Bamman says. “We’re at a really important time in the field.” Think of all the different ways you can sweat and you might be surprised that each falls into one of just two categories. You’re doing aerobic exercise when your breathing speeds up, your blood flows faster and your heart pumps more of it, shooting oxygen out to the tissues in the rest of the body. It’s the most popular kind; about half of Americans meet the recommendations for aerobic physical activity. But only 20% also do the other type, strength training. The phrase may conjure grunting weight lifters and gym dumbbells slick with sweat, but to build muscle and strengthen bones, you really only need to use your body weight as resistance, says Anthony Hackney, an exercise physiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That’s why things like yoga, tai chi and Pilates–not just pumping iron–are excellent forms of strength training. “People always get the image of the big, muscular guy,” Hackney says. “We try to think of muscle strength and power as a 65-year-old lady picking up a gallon of milk, pouring a glass and feeling comfortable.” In addition to the heart, muscles, lungs and bones, scientists are finding that another major beneficiary of exercise might be the brain. Recent research links exercise to less depression, better memory and quicker learning. Studies also suggest that exercise is, as of now, the best way to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s, which is second only to cancer as the disease Americans fear most, according to surveys. Scientists don’t know exactly why exercise changes the structure and function of the brain for the better, but it’s an area of active research. So far, they’ve found that exercise improves blood flow to the brain, feeding the growth of new blood vessels and even new brain cells, courtesy of the protein BDNF, short for brain-derived neurotrophic factor. BDNF triggers the growth of new neurons and helps repair and protect brain cells from degeneration. “I always tell people that exercise is regenerative medicine–restoring and repairing and basically fixing things that are broken,” Bamman says. Repairs like this throughout the body may be the reason exercise has been shown to extend life span by as much as five years. A small new study suggests that moderate-intensity exercise may slow down the aging of cells. As humans get older and their cells divide over and over again, their telomeres–the protective caps on the end of chromosomes–get shorter. To see how exercise affects telomeres, researchers took a muscle biopsy and blood samples from 10 healthy people before and after a 45-minute ride on a stationary bicycle. They found that exercise increased levels of a molecule that protects telomeres, ultimately slowing how quickly they shorten over time. Exercise, then, appears to slow aging at the cellular level. For all its merits, however, exercise is not an effective way to lose weight, research has shown. In a cruel twist, many people actually gain weight after they start exercising, whether from new muscle mass or a fired-up appetite. “Some people say exercise doesn’t do anything,” says researcher John Jakicic of the University of Pittsburgh. “Well, exercise does a lot. It just may not show up on the scale.” One of the best pieces of news is that so much of what we already do counts as physical activity. “Mowing the grass, raking leaves, washing the car–all that’s exercise,” says Berryman, the exercise historian. “Physical activity includes all movement, not just throwing a ball through a basket.” What’s more, emerging research suggests that it doesn’t take much movement to get the benefits. “We’ve been interested in the question of, How low can you go?” says Martin Gibala, an exercise physiologist at McMaster University. After all, if it were possible to reap all the health benefits of exercise in a tiny fraction of the time, who wouldn’t be compelled to give it a try? Gibala wanted to test how efficient and effective a 10-minute workout could be, compared with the standard 50-minutes-at-a-time approach. The micro-workout he devised consists of three exhausting 20-second bouts of all-out, hard-as-you-can exercise, followed by brief recoveries. In a three-month study, he pitted the short workout against the standard one to see which was better. To his amazement, the workouts resulted in identical improvements in heart function and blood-sugar control, even though one workout was five times longer than the other. “If you’re willing and able to push hard, you can get away with surprisingly little exercise,” Gibala says. Not everyone can–or wants to–do this kind of excruciating workout, often referred to as high-intensity interval training, or HIIT. Many of us would gladly bounce around in Zumba class for an hour to avoid enduring even a minute of HIIT torture. But considering that a lack of time is the No. 1 reason people say they don’t exercise, a workout far shorter than what’s generally recommended could be a strong motivator. Gibala, for his part, is wondering if the workout can get even shorter. He’s even played around with the idea of a one-minute workout. Not every type of exercise will work for every person, of course, but a growing body of research indicates that very vigorous exercise–like the interval workouts Gibala is studying–is, in fact, appropriate for people with different chronic conditions, from Type 2 diabetes to heart failure. That’s new thinking, because for decades, people with certain diseases and even pregnant women were advised not to exercise. Now scientists know that far more people can and should exercise. A recent analysis of more than 300 clinical trials discovered that for people recovering from a stroke, for instance, exercise was even more effective at helping them rehabilitate. Dr. Robert Sallis, a family physician who runs a sports-medicine fellowship at Kaiser Permanente Fontana Medical Center in California, has prescribed exercise to his patients since the early 1990s in hopes of doling out less medication. “It really worked amazingly, particularly in my very sickest patients,” he says. “If I could get them to do it on a regular basis–even just walking, anything that got their heart rate up a bit–I would see dramatic improvements in their chronic disease, not to mention all of these other things like depression, anxiety, mood and energy levels.” Older people, too, can benefit from strenuous exercise. Until now, all the recommendations for increasing bone density have included low-repetition, high-weight types of training, says Jinger Gottschall, associate professor of kinesiology at Penn State University. “But this just isn’t feasible for a lot of people. You can’t picture your grandma going in and doing that.” Luckily for Grandma, Gottschall’s team found that lifting lighter weights for more reps improves bone density in key parts of the body, making it a good alternative to heavy lifting. It’s becoming evident that nearly everyone–young, old, pregnant, ill–benefits from exercise. And as scientists learn more about why that is, they’re hoping that those early 20th century missteps–the move away from our being bodies in motion–will be reversed. They’re also hoping that the messaging around exercise gets simpler. “People think now, because of the health-club and fitness movement, that in order to exercise you need to join a fancy club and wear fancy clothes,” says Berryman. In fact, some of the best exercise, research is showing, doesn’t require a gym membership at all. Back at McMaster University, Tarnopolsky and his team are almost finished doing autopsies on mice from their new study, and even though the scalpel-wielding scientists are blind to which groups the mice were in, they can tell with certainty which animals were allowed to exercise and which were sedentary. “You open up the sedentary mice and there’s fat all over the place,” he says. About half of those mice have tumors. “They just look god-awful.” As for the mice who hit the wheel every day? “We haven’t found a single tumor,” he says. “I think if people saw, they’d be pretty motivated to exercise.” Write to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com", "nested_links": ["https://time.com/wellness-mags/"], "sentiment_score": 0.13643431725084956, "subjectivity_score": 0.46077114865421287}
